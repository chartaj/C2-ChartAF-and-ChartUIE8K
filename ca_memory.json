Use data-driven text annotations to display GDP values and highlight key countries like the US and China. This will visually compare sector contributions by country.\n<end of initial instruction>\n\n<start of further instruction>\nQuestions:\n1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the sectors (Agriculture, Industry, Services)?\n2. How would you prefer to highlight key countries like the US and China (e.g., larger markers, different colors, bold text)?\n3. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color/marker scheme used for different sectors and countries?\n4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations displaying GDP values?\n5. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability of data points?\n6. Are there specific axis labels or titles you would like to use for the chart?\n7. Would you like to include a brief title or caption for the entire scatter plot?\n8. Do you have a preference for the scaling of the axes (e.g., logarithmic or linear scale)?\n9. Should the scatter plot include data points for all countries, or only those with the largest GDP contributions?\n10. Would you like to annotate additional information such as GDP percentages or ranks in the scatter plot?\nAnswers:\n1. I am not sure.\n2. Larger markers and bold text for highlighting key countries like the US and China.\n3. I have no specific preference.\n4. I do not know.\n5. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.\n6. I am not sure.\n7. Yes, a brief title or caption would be good.\n8. I do not know.\n9. Include data points for all countries.\n10. I have no specific preference.\n<end of further instruction>\n\nEnsure you use this code format in order to avoid errors, and only give the executable Python Code.\n\nProgramming Language: [Python]\n\nCode:\n```Python\n# CODE FOR IMPORTING PACKAGES\n\ntry:\n    # CODE FOR LOADING AND PLOTTING THE DATA\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred\", e)\n\nfinally:\n    # Create plots directory if it does not exist\n    plots_dir = 'plots_d2c'\n    if not os.path.exists(plots_dir):\n        os.makedirs(plots_dir)\n\n    # CODE FOR SAVING THE PLOT, THEN SHOWING THE PLOT\n\n    print(\"Plot saved and then shown\")\n```"
