Include countries on the y-axis and penetration rates on the x-axis. Use distinct color gradients to represent different percentage ranges. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret for technology researchers.\n<end of initial instruction>\n\n<start of further instruction>\nQuestions:\n1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used in the heatmap?\n2. Should the color gradients have specific cut-off points for percentage ranges? If yes, what ranges do you have in mind?\n3. Do you want the countries to be sorted in a specific order on the y-axis (e.g., alphabetically or by penetration rate)?\n4. Would you like to include labels or annotations on the heatmap to show exact penetration rates for each country?\n5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size to be used in the heatmap for clarity and readability?\nAnswers:\n1. I am not sure.\n2. I am not sure.\n3. I would like the countries to be sorted by penetration rate.\n4. Yes, please include labels to show exact penetration rates for each country.\n5. I have no specific preference.\n<end of further instruction>\n\nEnsure you use this code format in order to avoid errors, and only give the executable Python Code.\n\nProgramming Language: [Python]\n\nCode:\n```Python\n# CODE FOR IMPORTING PACKAGES\n\ntry:\n    # CODE FOR LOADING AND PLOTTING THE DATA\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"An error occurred\", e)\n\nfinally:\n    # Create plots directory if it does not exist\n    plots_dir = 'plots_d2c'\n    if not os.path.exists(plots_dir):\n        os.makedirs(plots_dir)\n\n    # CODE FOR SAVING THE PLOT, THEN SHOWING THE PLOT\n\n    print(\"Plot saved and then shown\")\n```"
