The chart type should effectively convey the intended message; for example, bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities for limited number of categorical data, while line charts show trends over time. The choice must consider the inherent spacing requirements and the context in which the chart will be used, ensuring clarity and comprehension.\n\n        Visual Embellishment\n        - Use embellishments to enhance understanding without overwhelming the data. Visual embellishments, like icons, patterns, or textures, should be used sparingly and purposefully to make the chart memorable and engaging while maintaining a balance that does not distract from the core data.\n        \n        Text\n        - Prioritize legibility and adhere to consistent textual criteria. Text elements, such as legends, titles, and labels, should be legible and easy to read, with sufficient contrast against the background. Consistent font size, style, and placement should be maintained to create a cohesive visual narrative that guides the audience's understanding.\n\n        Color\n        - Use color purposefully and sparingly to convey meaning. Choose a limited palette that enhances readability and highlights key data points, considering color statistics and opponent processing principles (contrasting colors for clarity). This helps ensure accessibility for viewers with color vision deficiencies.\n\n        Annotation\n        - Emphasize critical data while minimizing irrelevant details. Use annotations strategically to draw attention to important insights, trends, or outliers, and smooth over or de-emphasize less significant data points, ensuring the chart communicates its key message effectively.\n\n        Aesthetics\n        - Tailor aesthetics to the chart's purpose, audience, and context. Consider the chart\u2019s purpose, the target audience, and the presentation environment when designing aesthetics, including compact spacing and visual hierarchy. This ensures the chart is both functional and appealing, maximizing its impact and effectiveness\n\n        Visual Clutter\n        - Optimize the chart size to fit its content and context, balancing data and available space to prevent clutter or excessive white space while maintaining readability. Manage visual elements by minimizing overcrowding and overlapping, adequately spacing text, data points, and annotations, removing unnecessary details, and maintaining a clean layout to enhance clarity. Segmentation of complex charts or data visualizations can also be employed if the visual complexity is high, breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable parts for easier interpretation. It is important to emphasize key data by using size, color, and opacity to highlight critical insights while downplaying less relevant information for a focused presentation.\n        \n<end of basic criteria>\n\n<start of user instruction>\nCreate a bar chart visualizing average N, P, K values for different crops.

This can include neutral or subdued tones to avoid overwhelming the highlighted crops.\n   - Ensure color choices accommodate color vision deficiencies by using high contrast, easily distinguishable colors.\n\n4. **Text Annotations**  \n   - Include text annotations displaying the average N, P, K values for both 'rice' and 'wheat,' ensuring these are clearly legible and appropriately positioned.\n   - Use consistent, simple font styles and sizes for annotations that are easily readable, maintaining visual balance without dominating the chart.\n\n5. **Grid Lines and Axis Details**  \n   - Consider the inclusion of grid lines if they improve readability and comparison; otherwise, minimize them to reduce clutter.\n   - Titles and labels for the axes should be informative yet concise, explaining the nutrient types and respective units clearly.\n\n6. **Legend and Labels**  \n   - Include a legend only if necessary to explain color coding or bar grouping; otherwise, ensure the chart is self-explanatory to avoid redundancy.\n   - Text labels on the bars themselves or axis should be clear, avoiding overcrowding or truncation.\n\n7. **Bar Arrangement and Grouping**  \n   - Decide on whether bars should be grouped by crop or stacked based on the clarity and ease of comparison; ensure they align with the task of showing individual crop nutrient values clearly.\n   - Arrange crops in a meaningful sequence that facilitates comparison, such as alphabetical or based on average values.\n\n8. **Axis Scaling and Range**  \n   - Determine an appropriate Y-axis range and scale that enhances the visibility of differences in nutrient values across crops, avoiding overly crammed or sparse intervals.\n\n9. **Visual Clutter Management**  \n   - Manage space effectively, ensuring the chart is neither too cramped nor too sparse, maintaining a clean and tidy visual presentation.\n   - Avoid unnecessary decorative elements that do not contribute to understanding the data, focusing on meaningful embellishments only.\n\n10. **Purpose and Audience Sensitivity**  \n    - Align the visual aesthetics with the preferences and expectations of agricultural researchers, farmers, and agronomists.\n    - Ensure the chart's purpose is fulfilled by clearly emphasizing key data insights, particularly the highlighted comparisons between different crops' nutrient needs.\n\nBy adhering to these criteria, the data visualization will be best positioned to achieve its intended purpose, effectively conveying information to the target audience while respecting user instructions and general best practices in design.",
    "04_asking_autofeedback_to_establish_criteria(claude)": "You are a data visualization expert.\nYou are given basic essential requirements of chart, user instruction, user request with QA, tasks that must be covered by the chart, purpose of the chart, and prospective audience of the chart.\n\nYour task is to develop a personalized, detailed, and objective list of criteria, building on the basic criteria, to evaluate a data visualization (chart).\nThese criteria should be based on the user instruction, the user request through questions and answers, tasks at hand, intended purpose, and the prospective audience.\n\n<start of basic criteria>\n\n        Chart Type\n        - Choose a chart type that aligns with the given purpose, task, and audience. The chart type should effectively convey the intended message; for example, bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities for limited number of categorical data, while line charts show trends over time. The choice must consider the inherent spacing requirements and the context in which the chart will be used, ensuring clarity and comprehension.\n\n        Visual Embellishment\n        - Use embellishments to enhance understanding without overwhelming the data. Visual embellishments, like icons, patterns, or textures, should be used sparingly and purposefully to make the chart memorable and engaging while maintaining a balance that does not distract from the core data.\n        \n        Text\n        - Prioritize legibility and adhere to consistent textual criteria. Text elements, such as legends, titles, and labels, should be legible and easy to read, with sufficient contrast against the background. Consistent font size, style, and placement should be maintained to create a cohesive visual narrative that guides the audience's understanding.\n\n        Color\n        - Use color purposefully and sparingly to convey meaning. Choose a limited palette that enhances readability and highlights key data points, considering color statistics and opponent processing principles (contrasting colors for clarity). This helps ensure accessibility for viewers with color vision deficiencies.\n\n        Annotation\n        - Emphasize critical data while minimizing irrelevant details. Use annotations strategically to draw attention to important insights, trends, or outliers, and smooth over or de-emphasize less significant data points, ensuring the chart communicates its key message effectively.\n\n        Aesthetics\n        - Tailor aesthetics to the chart's purpose, audience, and context. Consider the chart\u2019s purpose, the target audience, and the presentation environment when designing aesthetics, including compact spacing and visual hierarchy. This ensures the chart is both functional and appealing, maximizing its impact and effectiveness\n\n        Visual Clutter\n        - Optimize the chart size to fit its content and context, balancing data and available space to prevent clutter or excessive white space while maintaining readability. Manage visual elements by minimizing overcrowding and overlapping, adequately spacing text, data points, and annotations, removing unnecessary details, and maintaining a clean layout to enhance clarity. Segmentation of complex charts or data visualizations can also be employed if the visual complexity is high, breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable parts for easier interpretation. It is important to emphasize key data by using size, color, and opacity to highlight critical insights while downplaying less relevant information for a focused presentation.\n        \n<end of basic criteria>\n\n<start of user instruction>\nCreate a bar chart visualizing average N, P, K values for different crops.
