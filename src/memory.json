    "04_asking_autofeedback_to_establish_criteria(gpt4o)": "You are a data visualization expert.\nYou are given basic essential requirements of chart, user instruction, user request with QA, tasks that must be covered by the chart, purpose of the chart, and prospective audience of the chart.\n\nYour task is to develop a personalized, detailed, and objective list of criteria, building on the basic criteria, to evaluate a data visualization (chart).\nThese criteria should be based on the user instruction, the user request through questions and answers, tasks at hand, intended purpose, and the prospective audience.\n\n<start of basic criteria>\n\n        Chart Type\n        - Choose a chart type that aligns with the given purpose, task, and audience. The chart type should effectively convey the intended message; for example, bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities for limited number of categorical data, while line charts show trends over time. The choice must consider the inherent spacing requirements and the context in which the chart will be used, ensuring clarity and comprehension.\n\n        Visual Embellishment\n        - Use embellishments to enhance understanding without overwhelming the data. Visual embellishments, like icons, patterns, or textures, should be used sparingly and purposefully to make the chart memorable and engaging while maintaining a balance that does not distract from the core data.\n        \n        Text\n        - Prioritize legibility and adhere to consistent textual criteria. Text elements, such as legends, titles, and labels, should be legible and easy to read, with sufficient contrast against the background. Consistent font size, style, and placement should be maintained to create a cohesive visual narrative that guides the audience's understanding.\n\n        Color\n        - Use color purposefully and sparingly to convey meaning. Choose a limited palette that enhances readability and highlights key data points, considering color statistics and opponent processing principles (contrasting colors for clarity). This helps ensure accessibility for viewers with color vision deficiencies.\n\n        Annotation\n        - Emphasize critical data while minimizing irrelevant details. Use annotations strategically to draw attention to important insights, trends, or outliers, and smooth over or de-emphasize less significant data points, ensuring the chart communicates its key message effectively.\n\n        Aesthetics\n        - Tailor aesthetics to the chart's purpose, audience, and context. Consider the chart\u2019s purpose, the target audience, and the presentation environment when designing aesthetics, including compact spacing and visual hierarchy. This ensures the chart is both functional and appealing, maximizing its impact and effectiveness\n\n        Visual Clutter\n        - Optimize the chart size to fit its content and context, balancing data and available space to prevent clutter or excessive white space while maintaining readability. Manage visual elements by minimizing overcrowding and overlapping, adequately spacing text, data points, and annotations, removing unnecessary details, and maintaining a clean layout to enhance clarity. Segmentation of complex charts or data visualizations can also be employed if the visual complexity is high, breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable parts for easier interpretation. It is important to emphasize key data by using size, color, and opacity to highlight critical insights while downplaying less relevant information for a focused presentation.\n        \n<end of basic criteria>\n\n<start of user instruction>\nCreate a bar chart visualizing average N, P, K values for different crops. Highlight the 'rice' values with distinct colors. Include text annotations for crops 'rice' and 'wheat,' displaying their average N, P, K values.

    "04_asking_autofeedback_to_establish_criteria(claude)": "You are a data visualization expert.\nYou are given basic essential requirements of chart, user instruction, user request with QA, tasks that must be covered by the chart, purpose of the chart, and prospective audience of the chart.\n\nYour task is to develop a personalized, detailed, and objective list of criteria, building on the basic criteria, to evaluate a data visualization (chart).\nThese criteria should be based on the user instruction, the user request through questions and answers, tasks at hand, intended purpose, and the prospective audience.\n\n<start of basic criteria>\n\n        Chart Type\n        - Choose a chart type that aligns with the given purpose, task, and audience. The chart type should effectively convey the intended message; for example, bar charts are ideal for comparing quantities for limited number of categorical data, while line charts show trends over time. The choice must consider the inherent spacing requirements and the context in which the chart will be used, ensuring clarity and comprehension.\n\n        Visual Embellishment\n        - Use embellishments to enhance understanding without overwhelming the data. Visual embellishments, like icons, patterns, or textures, should be used sparingly and purposefully to make the chart memorable and engaging while maintaining a balance that does not distract from the core data.\n        \n        Text\n        - Prioritize legibility and adhere to consistent textual criteria. Text elements, such as legends, titles, and labels, should be legible and easy to read, with sufficient contrast against the background. Consistent font size, style, and placement should be maintained to create a cohesive visual narrative that guides the audience's understanding.\n\n        Color\n        - Use color purposefully and sparingly to convey meaning. Choose a limited palette that enhances readability and highlights key data points, considering color statistics and opponent processing principles (contrasting colors for clarity). This helps ensure accessibility for viewers with color vision deficiencies.\n\n        Annotation\n        - Emphasize critical data while minimizing irrelevant details. Use annotations strategically to draw attention to important insights, trends, or outliers, and smooth over or de-emphasize less significant data points, ensuring the chart communicates its key message effectively.\n\n        Aesthetics\n        - Tailor aesthetics to the chart's purpose, audience, and context. Consider the chart\u2019s purpose, the target audience, and the presentation environment when designing aesthetics, including compact spacing and visual hierarchy. This ensures the chart is both functional and appealing, maximizing its impact and effectiveness\n\n        Visual Clutter\n        - Optimize the chart size to fit its content and context, balancing data and available space to prevent clutter or excessive white space while maintaining readability. Manage visual elements by minimizing overcrowding and overlapping, adequately spacing text, data points, and annotations, removing unnecessary details, and maintaining a clean layout to enhance clarity. Segmentation of complex charts or data visualizations can also be employed if the visual complexity is high, breaking down the data into smaller, more manageable parts for easier interpretation.
