initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize Amazon's 500 Bestsellers in Laptop
  Gear. Plot the prices on the x-axis and the star ratings on the y-axis. Highlight
  points where data is missing for stars or price. Use different colors for each brand
  to differentiate them clearly. Also, show a tooltip on hover to display the product
  title and number of reviews. This will help identify the most popular and highest-rated
  products easily. Add a trend line to show any correlation between price and star
  rating. Make sure to label the axes properly for better understanding.
