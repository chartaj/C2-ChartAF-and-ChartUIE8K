initial_prompt: Create an area chart showcasing Amazon's 500 Bestsellers in Laptop
  Gear 2024. Display the distribution of star ratings (from 1 to 5 stars) against
  the number of reviews received. Use data from the columns 'stars' and 'reviewsCount'
  to plot this. The x-axis should represent the star ratings, while the y-axis shows
  the total reviews count. Highlight variations in product popularity and customer
  satisfaction trends within the 'computers-and-technology' category. Ensure the chart
  is visually appealing, with distinct color gradients to differentiate star rating
  levels, and includes a legend for clarity.
