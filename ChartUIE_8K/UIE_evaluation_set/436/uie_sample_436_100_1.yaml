initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Marbula 1 Season 1 championship
  ranking over time. The x-axis should represent different race dates, and the y-axis
  should list the marble names. Use color intensity to highlight the average times
  per lap. Annotate specific points where notable performances occurred, like top
  speeds or significant improvements. Provide context in the annotations for better
  understanding. The purpose of this heatmap is to track performance patterns and
  identify key players in the championship. Use different colors to distinguish between
  races and average lap times. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret and visually
  appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific colors to distinguish between races and average lap
  times?

  3. How detailed would you like the annotations to be for notable performances?

  5. Do you have any preferred format for annotating notable dates and events?

  6. Should certain marbles or teams be highlighted more prominently in the visualization?

  7. How granular should the time segmentation be for the x-axis (e.g., by day, week,
  or race event)?

  8. Are there any specific performance metrics you want to emphasize in the annotations
  (e.g., top speeds, significant improvements)?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text elements in the heatmap?'
