initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the Marbula 1 Season 1 championship
  ranking over time. Each bar should represent a race and be divided into segments
  for each team, showing their respective points. Use different colors for each team,
  and ensure the x-axis represents the dates of the races and the y-axis represents
  the points scored. Highlight key races and make the chart interactive, allowing
  for details on hover. Add legends and labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for different teams?

  2. Would you prefer the dates on the x-axis to be formatted in a particular way
  (e.g., ''DD-MMM-YY'', ''MM/DD/YYYY'')?

  3. How would you like key races to be highlighted (e.g., special markers, different
  colors)?

  4. Do you have a preference for where the legend should be placed (e.g., top, right,
  bottom, left)?

  5. What level of detail would you like on the labels (e.g., exact points, team names,
  both)?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart, and if so, for which axis (x-axis, y-axis,
  both)?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or text boxes added to the chart for
  important insights or notes?

  8. How much spacing would you like between the bars representing each race?

  9. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the titles and labels?

  10. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitle? If so, do you have
  any preferred text for them?'
