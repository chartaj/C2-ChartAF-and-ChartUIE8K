initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the relationship between the
  dates and the stock market indicators (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close). Each
  group should represent a specific Date and display bars for each indicator value.
  Highlight significant changes in percentage with different color bars to emphasize
  where major losses or gains occur. Incorporate text annotations to explain important
  events or influences like market movements due to astrology predictions or global
  crisis impacts. Visualization should serve to analyze stock performance over time
  and correlate with provided stock market predictions and annotated text data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for highlighting significant
  changes in percentage?

  2. Would you prefer specific colors to represent gains and losses, and if so, what
  are your preferences?

  3. What style of text annotations do you prefer (e.g., simple labels, detailed descriptions,
  or tooltips)?

  4. Should the bars for each stock market indicator have specific colors, or would
  you prefer the chart to use a default color scheme?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font type and size used in the chart for titles,
  labels, and annotations?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines or any other specific chart elements to improve
  readability?

  7. Should we include a legend to differentiate between the stock market indicators
  and the significant percentage changes?

  8. Are there any specific events or dates that you would like to highlight with
  more detailed annotations?

  9. Do you prefer the bars to be grouped by month, week, or specific date intervals
  when displaying the data?

  10. Do you have any specific layout preferences for the chart, such as aspect ratio
  or orientation (e.g., vertical or horizontal bars)?'
