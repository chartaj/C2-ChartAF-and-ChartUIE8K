initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize stock market predictions based on
  astrology data. The x-axis should represent the 'Date', and the y-axis should show
  the 'Close' prices. Include data annotations to highlight 'Perc_Change' values on
  specific dates to focus on significant changes. Add text annotations near specific
  data points featuring insights from the 'Text' column to provide context. Additionally,
  use different colors to highlight different trends in 'Close' prices over time to
  make trends and anomalies stand out. Consider showing prediction confidence by shading
  areas based on 'Clean_Text' sentiments. Thank you.
