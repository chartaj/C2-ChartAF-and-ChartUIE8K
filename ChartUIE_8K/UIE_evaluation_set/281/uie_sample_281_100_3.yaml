initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for my astrology-based stock prediction data.
  Please plot the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' prices on the y-axis. Additionally,
  add another scatter plot on the same chart showing 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Volume'
  on the y-axis. Use different colors for 'Close' and 'Volume' to differentiate them.
  Include a legend to indicate which color represents which data. Title the chart
  as "Astrology-Based Stock Predictions". Make sure the dates are properly formatted
  and the plot is easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the ''Close'' prices
  and ''Volume'' data points?

  2. What format would you like the dates to be in on the x-axis?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size of the scatter plot markers for better
  visibility?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the title and legend?

  6. Do you need any specific annotations or labels on the data points?

  7. What range should the y-axes (for ''Close'' prices and ''Volume'') cover, or
  should they be automatically decided based on the data?

  8. Do you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific location within the chart?

  9. Would you like to have axis labels besides the title to clarify what each axis
  represents?

  10. Should there be any trend lines fitted to the data points on the scatter plot
  to indicate trends or patterns?'
