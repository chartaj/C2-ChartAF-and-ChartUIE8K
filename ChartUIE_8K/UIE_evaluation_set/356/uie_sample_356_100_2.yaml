initial_prompt: Please create a Donut chart to visualize the health status distribution
  of honey bees from the provided dataset. Highlight the health categories with text
  annotations for each segment showing the percentage distribution. This helps in
  understanding the health conditions prevalent among the bees in different locations.
  Use different colors to distinguish each health status for clearer interpretation.
  The focus should be on emphasizing the health challenges like "hive being robbed"
  and "struggling" to inform further biological research and actions needed for bee
  conservation efforts.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for distinguishing each health
  status in the Donut chart?

  2. Would you like the text annotations for each segment showing the percentage distribution
  to have a specific font style or size?

  3. Should the segments representing "hive being robbed" and "struggling" be emphasized
  in any particular way, such as using bolder colors or larger font sizes for annotations?

  4. Do you prefer the Donut chart to have a title? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Should the legend be displayed inside the chart, outside the chart, or not at
  all?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the health status segments
  to be displayed (e.g., in descending order of prevalence)?

  7. Do you want any additional information or labels, such as the total count of
  bees in each health status segment, displayed on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Yes, please use bolder colors and larger font sizes for the annotations of "hive
  being robbed" and "struggling."

  4. Yes, the title should be "Health Status Distribution of Honey Bees."

  5. Inside the chart.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
