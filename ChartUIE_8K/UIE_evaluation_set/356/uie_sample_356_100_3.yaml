initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the health status of honey bees across
  different locations and dates in the BeeImage Dataset. Use the provided data with
  columns - 'location', 'date', and 'health'. Each cell in the heatmap should represent
  the count of a specific health status for honey bees at a particular location and
  date. This visualization will help in identifying patterns in bee health over time
  and across different regions. Ensure the heatmap is color-coded to differentiate
  varying counts, making it easier to spot trends and anomalies in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the dates to be displayed in any specific format?

  3. Should the heatmap cells display the count values, or do you prefer them to be
  hidden?

  4. Do you have a preference for how the date axis is organized (e.g., daily, monthly
  intervals)?

  5. Are there any specific locations you wish to highlight or compare in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color-coding of the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the text font and size in the heatmap?

  8. Should the health statuses be ordered in a specific way (e.g., by severity)?

  9. Do you want to add labels or annotations to highlight specific trends or anomalies?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or titles you would like to add to the
  heatmap for better clarity?'
