initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the distribution of honey bee health
  statuses over different dates and times. The x-axis should represent the dates,
  and the y-axis should represent the times of the day. Each point should represent
  a bee image, color-coded by health status. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight
  specific instances of 'hive being robbed' and 'worker' caste. The aim is to identify
  patterns or anomalies in bee health over time. This visualization is intended for
  biology researchers analyzing the health conditions and behavior patterns of honey
  bees in various locations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the health status categories?

  2. How would you like the dates to be formatted on the x-axis (e.g., ''MM/DD/YY'',
  ''Month Day, Year'')?

  3. Do you have a preferred time format for the y-axis (e.g., ''HH:MM'', ''HH:MM
  AM/PM'')?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like a legend included to explain the color-coding of health statuses?

  6. Should the text annotations for ''hive being robbed'' and ''worker'' caste include
  any additional details?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the scatter plot markers (e.g., circle, square,
  triangle)?

  8. Would you like grid lines included in the background of the chart?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the bee images to be represented in the
  scatter plot points?

  10. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color preferences for the health status categories.

  2. I don''t have a specific preference for the date format on the x-axis.

  3. I am not sure about the time format for the y-axis.

  4. I do not know about specific fonts or font sizes for the text annotations.

  5. Yes, I would like a legend included to explain the color-coding of health statuses.

  6. The text annotations for ''hive being robbed'' and ''worker'' caste should just
  highlight those instances without additional details.

  7. I don''t have a preference for the style of the scatter plot markers.

  8. Yes, please include grid lines in the background of the chart.

  9. I have no specific preference for how the bee images should be represented in
  the scatter plot points.

  10. I do not have any preference for the background color of the chart.'
