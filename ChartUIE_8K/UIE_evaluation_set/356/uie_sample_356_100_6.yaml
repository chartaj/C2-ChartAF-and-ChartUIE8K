initial_prompt: Can you create a line chart that showcases the bee health status over
  time using the data from '356.csv'? I want to see how the health conditions like
  'hive being robbed' are distributed across different dates and times. It would be
  helpful to have the x-axis represent the date and time while the y-axis displays
  the frequency or count of each health condition. This chart should help us understand
  if there are any particular times or dates when the bees are more prone to certain
  health issues.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the line
  chart?

  2. How would you like the dates and times to be formatted on the x-axis?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style or type of lines (e.g., solid, dashed) for the
  chart?

  4. Should we use different line colors or markers to differentiate between various
  health conditions?

  5. Would you like to include labels or annotations for specific data points on the
  chart?

  6. Are there any specific ranges of time or dates that you want to highlight on
  the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines? If so, how dense should they be?

  8. Should the y-axis show absolute counts, percentages, or frequencies?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to indicate what each line or marker represents?

  10. Do you want any trend lines or smoothing applied to the data to better observe
  trends?'
