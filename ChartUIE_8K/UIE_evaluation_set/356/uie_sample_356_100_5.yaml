initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset named "The BeeImage Dataset: Annotated Honey Bee
  Images" that includes columns like file name, date, time, location, zip code, subspecies,
  health status, pollen carrying status, and caste. I want to create a geographic
  heatmap that showcases the distribution of honey bee health status across different
  locations. The heatmap should highlight areas with high incidences of certain health
  conditions. Please make sure the map is interactive, allowing me to zoom in and
  click on specific regions to see details such as the exact number of occurrences
  and other relevant data points.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for representing different health statuses
  on the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preference for the base map style (e.g., satellite, street map,
  terrain)?

  3. Should the heatmap use a gradient or discrete color steps to indicate different
  levels of incidence?

  4. Do you want any specific annotations or labels on the map (e.g., city names,
  infection rates)?

  5. How would you like the data points to be aggregated (e.g., by city, zip code,
  or another geographic unit)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the tooltips that appear when clicking on specific
  regions?

  7. Would you like any additional layers or markers on the map (e.g., bee population
  density, presence of beekeeping facilities)?'
