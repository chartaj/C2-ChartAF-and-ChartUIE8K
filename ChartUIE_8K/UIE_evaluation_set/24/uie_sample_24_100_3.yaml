initial_prompt: I have a dataset about students' grades and several attributes like
  age, sex, studytime, and family support, among others. Could you create a heatmap
  that visualizes the correlation between these variables and students' final grades
  (G3)? I'm particularly interested in seeing how factors like study time, family
  relationship quality, and failures impact grades. Please make sure to highlight
  the strong correlations so we can easily identify which factors are most influential.
  Also, include a color bar and clear labels for better readability.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color bar represent values on a linear scale or would you prefer a
  logarithmic scale?

  3. Are there specific correlation thresholds that you want to highlight, such as
  strong positive or negative correlations?

  4. Would you like to include the exact correlation values as annotations on the
  heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer labels and values in the heatmap to be in a particular font style
  or size?

  6. Should the heatmap be oriented in a particular way, such as with attributes listed
  along the rows or columns?

  7. Are there any additional variables not listed that you would like to see included
  in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, use what you think is best for
  readability.

  2. I do not know, just go with what is standard.

  3. Yes, highlight strong correlations above 0.5 and below -0.5.

  4. Yes, please include the exact correlation values as annotations.

  5. I am not sure about font style or size, use what is commonly used.

  6. No specific preference for orientation; use what is most clear.

  7. No, I think the listed variables cover what I am interested in.'
