initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot visualizing student age against G3 grades from
  the dataset. Use text annotations to highlight ages with the highest G3 scores.
  Purpose: understand the relationship between age and final grades. Highlights: use
  different colors or point sizes to differentiate performance. Add annotations to
  data points representing outstanding or poor performance to draw attention to these
  cases. The visualization aims to provide insights into how age might impact academic
  performance, aiding in education strategy decisions. Title the scatter plot "Student
  Age vs. Final Grades" for clarity.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating performance
  levels?

  2. Would you like the point sizes to correspond to specific performance metrics,
  and if so, which ones?

  3. Do you have specific thresholds for what constitutes ''outstanding'' or ''poor''
  performance?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the text annotations?

  5. Should the age groups be categorized in any specific way (e.g., age ranges) for
  better clarity?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or a specific type of axis labeling?

  7. Are there any particular data points or patterns you are specifically interested
  in highlighting?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Outstanding performance might be G3 scores above 18, and poor performance might
  be G3 scores below 10.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I am specifically interested in highlighting any data points where students have
  exceptionally high or low G3 scores.'
