initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualizing student grades (G1, G2, G3) based
  on different categorical features such as school, sex, and address. The plot should
  show the distribution of grades for these categories, highlighting medians, quartiles,
  and outliers. This will help in understanding trends and variations in student performance
  across these groups. Also, include individual data points overlaid on the box plots
  to provide a clear picture of the grade distribution. Make sure the chart is easy
  to interpret and visually appealing for educational insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box plots?

  2. Do you want the categories (school, sex, address) displayed side-by-side or stacked?

  3. Should we use different colors for individual data points based on categories?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size and style of individual data points?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer specific labels or annotations for median, quartiles, and outliers?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you want for titles, labels, and legends?

  8. Do you want the chart title and axis labels styled in a particular way?

  9. Should we use any specific thematic elements to make the chart more visually
  appealing?'
