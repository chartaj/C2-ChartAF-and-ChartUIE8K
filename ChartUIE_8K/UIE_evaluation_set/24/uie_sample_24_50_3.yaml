initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations among different variables
  affecting student grades from the provided dataset. Include all the numerical columns
  (age, Medu, Fedu, traveltime, studytime, etc.) and grades (G1, G2, G3). Highlight
  stronger correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme of the heatmap
  (e.g., warm colors, cool colors, divergent colors)?

  2. How would you like to represent stronger correlations (e.g., use of bold colors,
  annotations)?

  3. Should the heatmap include any labels or annotations for specific correlation
  values?

  4. What is the preferred range of correlation coefficients to be highlighted (e.g.,
  above 0.7, below -0.7)?

  5. Do you require a legend to explain the color intensity representing the correlation
  strength?

  6. Would you prefer to have gridlines or separators between the cells in the heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific variable pairs you want to emphasize or analyze more closely?

  8. Is the orientation of the labels important to you (e.g., horizontal, vertical,
  or angled)?

  9. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  10. Do you have any preference for the size or dimensions of the heatmap?'
