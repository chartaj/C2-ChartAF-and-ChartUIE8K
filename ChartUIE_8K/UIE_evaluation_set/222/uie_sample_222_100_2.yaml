initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the Top 100 Cities Weather Dataset.
  Use color gradients to represent temperature variations across different cities.
  Annotate the map with the city names and their respective temperatures, particularly
  highlighting cities with extreme temperatures (hottest and coldest). Additionally,
  include markers that show wind speed information. Ensure the map provides clear
  visual differentiation between countries. Include side text annotations specifying
  interesting findings, such as notable temperature differences between neighboring
  cities. This will help viewers quickly grasp diverse weather patterns worldwide.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient to represent the temperature
  variations?

  2. How would you like extreme temperatures to be highlighted (e.g., specific colors,
  icons)?

  3. What type of markers would you prefer for showing wind speed information?

  4. Do you have a specific style or format in mind for the city names and their respective
  temperature annotations?

  5. Is there a preferred way you would like the countries to be visually differentiated
  on the map (e.g., borders, colors)?

  6. Would you like the side text annotations to be placed in a specific position
  or formatted in a certain way?

  7. Are there any specific findings or notable temperature differences you already
  have in mind that you want to be highlighted?

  8. What level of detail do you require for the wind speed markers (e.g., numeric
  values, visual icons)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Specific colors for hottest and coldest cities might be a good idea.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Borders might work well.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Numeric values should be fine.'
