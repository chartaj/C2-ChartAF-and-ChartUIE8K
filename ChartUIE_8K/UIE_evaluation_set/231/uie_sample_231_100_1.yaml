initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the number of views and likes of TED
  Talks from the provided data. Use different colors to distinguish between 'views'
  and 'likes.' Add text annotations for the highest data points in both views and
  likes to focus attention. Highlight the titles of the top three most-viewed talks
  to make them stand out. This will help understand audience engagement and popularity
  trends. The chart should emphasize how play, history, and leadership gain traction
  within the TED Talks community, providing useful insights for educational purposes.
  Ensure that it is visually appealing and easy to interpret.
