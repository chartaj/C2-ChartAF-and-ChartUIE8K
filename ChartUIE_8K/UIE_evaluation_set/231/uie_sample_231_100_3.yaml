initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the TED Talks data. For the x-axis,
  use the "views" column, and for the y-axis, use the "likes" column. Each point on
  the scatter plot should represent a TED Talk. Use different colors or markers to
  distinguish between different authors. Please ensure that the axes are labeled properly
  to reflect the context of the data, with titles "Number of Views" and "Number of
  Likes". Additionally, include a legend that details which color or marker corresponds
  to which author. Include a link back to the relevant talk in the tooltip or data
  point.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for distinguishing\
  \ between different authors?\n2. Is there a particular style or design you prefer\
  \ for the markers representing data points?\n3. Would you like the data points to\
  \ have specific shapes based on certain criteria, such as author?\n4. Should the\
  \ tooltips displaying the links be always visible or only upon hovering over a data\
  \ point?\n5. Do you want any specific format or additional information included\
  \ in the axis labels?\n6. Do you have any preferences for the layout or position\
  \ of the legend on the scatter plot?\n7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes\
  \ you prefer for the labels, titles, and legend? \n8. Would you like to highlight\
  \ or annotate certain data points based on specific criteria?"
