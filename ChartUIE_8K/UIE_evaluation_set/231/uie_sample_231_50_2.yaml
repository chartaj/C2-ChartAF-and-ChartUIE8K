initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the trend of views and likes over time

  with the most views.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for highlighting key data points (e.g., different
  color, larger markers)?

  5. How detailed would you like the text annotations to be? (e.g., just the title
  of the TED Talk or additional information such as views and likes)

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for easier readability?

  or speaker) in the chart?'
