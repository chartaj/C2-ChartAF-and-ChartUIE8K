initial_prompt: '<start of instructions>

  Create a line chart to visualize the tenure of customers over time, highlighting
  specific trends in MonthlyCharges and TotalCharges. Use annotations to point out
  significant drops or spikes in charges, and emphasize the Churn status. This will
  help identify patterns in customer behavior related to their subscriptions and billing.
  Add contextual notes to explain any observed trends, focusing particularly on long-term
  customers and those more likely to churn. This will support business decisions in
  retaining customers by understanding tenure and billing impacts on churn.
