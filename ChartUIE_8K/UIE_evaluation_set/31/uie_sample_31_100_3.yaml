initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart illustrating the tenure of customers
  based on their churn status. Use the "tenure" for the x-axis (grouped in increments
  of 5 months), and stack based on "Churn" status. Each stack should differentiate
  between those who have churned and those who have not. For the columns, the y-axis
  should represent the count of customers within each tenure group. Ensure clear labels
  for both axis and a legend indicating churn status. The chart should help visualize
  how customer tenure correlates with churn, aiding in churn analysis and prevention
  strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different churn
  statuses?

  2. What title would you like to give to the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Would you like to include data labels showing the exact count of customers within
  each tenure group?

  5. Do you prefer a specific order for the legend items (churn status)?

  6. Should the increments for the x-axis (tenure) begin at zero, or do you have another
  starting point in mind?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier readability, and if so, should
  they be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s layout or orientation (e.g., landscape
  or portrait)?

  9. Is there any additional information or annotations you would like to include
  in the chart to enhance its interpretability?

  10. Are there any accessibility considerations or specific charting tools you would
  prefer to ensure the chart meets your team''s needs?'
