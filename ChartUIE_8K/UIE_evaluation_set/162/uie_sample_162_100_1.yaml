initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the Living Planet Index over the
  years for different regions, focusing on the period from 1970 to 2016. Highlight
  significant changes and add annotations for key data points. Include upper and lower
  confidence intervals to show the range of estimates. Use text annotations to spotlight
  notable trends or discrepancies in the data. Incorporate shape annotations, like
  trend lines or shaded areas, to compare different regions effectively. The chart
  aims to provide an intuitive understanding of biodiversity trends over time and
  can be useful for educational or environmental policy discussions.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you prefer for different regions in the
  line chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the thickness or style of the lines representing
  the regions?

  or shaded areas?

  8. Do you want a legend to identify the different regions, and if so, where would

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  10. Is there a particular layout or format you prefer for the chart to best suit
  the educational or policy discussions?'
