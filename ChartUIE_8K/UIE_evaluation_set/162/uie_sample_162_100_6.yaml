initial_prompt: 'I need a grouped column chart that visualizes the Living Planet Index
  values over the years for Africa. The chart should include columns for each year
  from 1970 to 1972, with three groups for each year: Living Planet Index, Upper CI
  (95% CI), and Lower CI (95% CI). Ensure the x-axis represents the years and the
  y-axis represents the index values. Each group should have a different color for
  better distinction. The chart should help in understanding the changes and uncertainty
  in the Living Planet Index over time.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different groups of columns
  (Living Planet Index, Upper CI, Lower CI)?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reference to the index values?

  3. Should the x-axis labels be angled or rotated for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer specific fonts or font sizes for the axis labels and title?

  5. Would you like to include a legend indicating what each color represents?

  6. Are there any specific titles you want for the chart and the axes?

  7. Do you want data labels displayed on top of each column?

  8. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or allow it to adjust automatically
  based on the data?'
