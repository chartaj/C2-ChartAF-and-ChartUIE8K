initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap of the Living Planet Index over the years
  for Africa. Utilize the 'Year' for the x-axis and 'Living Planet Index' values for
  the color intensity. Include upper and lower confidence intervals as overlays.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the years on the x-axis to be displayed with a specific rotation
  or format?

  3. Should the color intensity for the ''Living Planet Index'' use a gradient scale,
  and if so, do you have any specific preferences for the gradient colors?

  4. How would you like the confidence intervals to be displayed as overlays (e.g.,
  error bars, shaded regions)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  6. Should gridlines be included in the heatmap, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for their appearance?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color intensity and confidence
  intervals? If so, any preferences for its placement?

  8. Do you have specific preferences for the overall layout and dimensions of the
  chart?

  9. Is there any additional text or annotations you would like to include in the
  visualization for further context?

  10. How detailed should the labels on the color intensity scale be (e.g., more granularity
  or a broader range)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap.

  2. I am not sure about the rotation or format for the years on the x-axis.

  3. I am not sure, but a gradient scale would be fine.

  4. Error bars for the confidence intervals might be good.

  5. I do not know about specific font styles or sizes.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for gridlines.

  7. Yes, include a legend for the color intensity and confidence intervals, but I
  am not sure about the placement.

  8. I am not sure about the layout and dimensions.

  9. I do not have any additional text or annotations to include.

  10. I am not sure about the detail level for the labels on the color intensity scale.'
