initial_prompt: 'I would like to create a column chart visualizing the streaming metrics
  for the Top 3 Spotify Songs of 2024, which are "MILLION DOLLAR BABY," "Not Like
  Us," and "i like the way you kiss me." Each column should represent a song, and
  the height should represent the metric value. Include these metrics: Spotify Streams,
  YouTube Views, TikTok Views, and Pandora Streams for each song. Formatting should
  ensure clear reading, with different colors for each metric. Title the chart "Top
  3 Spotify Songs 2024 - Streaming Metrics." Include a legend to differentiate between
  each metric.'

  (Spotify Streams, YouTube Views, TikTok Views, Pandora Streams)?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the title and legend of the chart?

  3. Would you like data labels to be displayed on the columns to show the exact metric
  values?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines to enhance readability, and if so, what style
  do you prefer (solid, dashed, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis titles and labels (font style,
  size, and orientation)?

  6. Would you prefer a specific ordering for the columns (e.g., Spotify Streams first,
  YouTube Views second, etc.)?

  7. Is there a particular chart size or aspect ratio you prefer for visualizing this
  data?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the column width and spacing between the
  columns?

  9. Should there be any annotations or additional information included in the chart
  for context?

  10. Would you prefer a light or dark background for the chart?'
