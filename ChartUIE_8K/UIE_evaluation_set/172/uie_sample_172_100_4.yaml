initial_prompt: I need a line chart showing the Spotify streams over time for the
  top 3 songs in 2024. Use data from the given CSV, focusing on the 'Spotify Streams'
  and 'Release Date' columns. Each song should have its own line, and the x-axis should
  represent the release dates. The y-axis should show the number of streams, formatted
  with commas for readability. Also, include labels for each of the lines to identify
  the corresponding songs. This visualization will help compare the streaming performance
  of these top tracks over the year.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the lines representing
  each song?

  2. Would you like to include markers on the data points along the lines?

  3. How would you like to handle dates on the x-axis, such as monthly ticks or specific
  intervals?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement in the chart?

  5. Would you like gridlines in the chart, and if so, should they be for both x-axis
  and y-axis?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you want for the axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Is there a particular chart title you would like to include?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to have a background color or border?

  9. Are annotations needed for any specific data points or events?

  10. Would you like to see a trend line or any form of smoothing applied to the data
  lines?'
