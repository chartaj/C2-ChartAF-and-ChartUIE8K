initial_prompt: I need a histogram for the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset.
  The x-axis should represent "Spotify Popularity" and the y-axis should represent
  the "Frequency" of tracks having that popularity score. Please use different colors
  to indicate varying popularities. If there's any missing popularity values, handle
  them appropriately. Include a legend. Make sure the bins are properly sized to clearly
  show the distribution. Additionally, it would be helpful to have titles and labels
  for clarity. This will help visualize how popularity scores are distributed among
  the top-streamed songs of 2024. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to indicate
  varying popularities?

  2. What size would you prefer the bins to be in the histogram?

  3. Should the missing popularity values be excluded or filled with a specific value?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the histogram?

  5. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis, if different from ''Spotify
  Popularity'' and ''Frequency''?

  6. Do you want any specific font style or size for the titles and labels?

  7. Are there any specific data ranges or outliers that you want to highlight in
  the histogram?'
