initial_prompt: I need a spline chart that shows the correlation between "Spotify
  Streams" and "YouTube Views" for the top 3 tracks in the "Most Streamed Spotify
  Songs 2024" dataset. The x-axis should represent "Spotify Streams" and the y-axis
  should represent "YouTube Views." Each data point should be labeled with the track
  name for clarity. Additionally, please include different colors for each track to
  differentiate them. This visualization will help identify how Spotify popularity
  translates to YouTube viewership among the most streamed songs of 2024.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for differentiating
  the tracks?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences or styles for the data labels and axis
  titles?

  4. Is there a preferred legend placement for identifying the different tracks?

  5. Do you want to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Would you prefer the data points to have markers or symbols for better visibility?

  7. Should there be any specific scaling or formatting for the "Spotify Streams"
  and "YouTube Views" axes, such as thousands, millions, etc.?

  8. Do you have a preferred style for the spline curves (e.g., smooth, stepped, dotted)?

  9. Should the chart include any annotations or notes for additional context?

  10. Would you like to display any trend lines or regression lines to highlight the
  correlation further?'
