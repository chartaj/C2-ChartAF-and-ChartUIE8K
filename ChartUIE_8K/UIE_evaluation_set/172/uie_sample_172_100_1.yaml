initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs
  2024". Use Spotify Streams as the bubble size to show which tracks are most popular.
  On the x-axis, plot Track Score and on the y-axis, plot Spotify Popularity. Include
  text annotations for the top three tracks to highlight their values and their relevance.
  Additionally, distinguish the top-ranked song with a unique color to emphasize its
  significance. This visualization should help users easily identify and compare the
  popularity and score of the top streamed songs on Spotify for 2024.
