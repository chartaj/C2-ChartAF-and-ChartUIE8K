initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot titled "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024."
  Plot the "Spotify Streams" on the Y-axis and "Spotify Playlist Count" on the X-axis.
  Use different colors for each "Artist" to distinguish them. Include a legend to
  explain the colors. Make sure to label the axes and provide a title. Include markers
  for each track and ensure the plots are well-spaced for readability. This chart
  should help us visualize the relationship between the number of streams and playlist
  counts for popular songs. Thank you!

  different artists?

  2. Would you like any specific style or shape for the markers representing each
  track?

  4. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability, and if so, what style

  6. Do you have any preferences for the size of the markers on the scatter plot?
