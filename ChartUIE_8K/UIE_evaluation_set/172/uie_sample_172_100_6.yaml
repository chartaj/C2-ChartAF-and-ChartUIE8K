initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart displaying the most streamed Spotify songs
  of 2024. Include the Track, Artist, and Spotify Streams columns. The x-axis should
  represent the Track names, and the y-axis should show the total number of Spotify
  Streams. Make sure to label the axes clearly and use different colors for each bar
  to distinguish the tracks. Also, provide a title for the chart, such as "Top Streamed
  Spotify Songs 2024." Include at least the top 10 tracks in the chart. Thank you!
