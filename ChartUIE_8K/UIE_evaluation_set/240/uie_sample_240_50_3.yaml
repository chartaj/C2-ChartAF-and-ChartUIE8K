initial_prompt: 'Create a geographic heatmap showing the distribution of universities
  by city. Use "City Name" for locations and "University Name" to represent data density. '
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a gradient to show different densities, and if so, do
  you have a preference for specific colors in the gradient?

  3. Would you like city names to be labeled directly on the heatmap?

  4. Should we include a legend to indicate what different colors or levels of density
  represent?

  imagery)?

  6. Would you like the map to display country or state boundaries in addition to
  city locations?

  number of universities per 100,000 residents)?

  8. Should any cities or regions be highlighted or emphasized more than others?

  9. Is there a specific geographic scope you want to focus on (e.g., a particular
  country or continent)?
