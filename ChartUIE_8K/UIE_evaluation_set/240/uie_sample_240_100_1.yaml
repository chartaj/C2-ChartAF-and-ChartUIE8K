initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of tuition fees across
  German university courses. Use the 'Tuition Fees' column from the provided data.
  Highlight the bars with specific fee ranges to emphasize trends or notable data
  points, such as no tuition fees or higher fee categories. Annotate these highlights
