initial_prompt: Visualize the trend of tuition fees over different program durations
  for German university courses. Use a line chart with "Duration of Programme" on
  the x-axis and "Tuition Fees" on the y-axis. Annotate key data points where tuition
  fees are either significantly low or high to highlight trends. This visualization
  helps prospective students compare costs effectively. Highlight specific courses
  starting at different times to understand how the beginning of enrolment affects
  tuition fees. Make the city names distinct by color for additional context. Use
  30 data points for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific ranges or intervals to be
  used on the x-axis for "Duration of Programme"?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer to distinguish different "City Names"?

  3. Should the key data points with significantly low or high tuition fees be annotated
  with specific labels or icons?

  4. Do you have a preferred format or style for annotating key data points (e.g.,
  tooltips, flags, text boxes)?

  5. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the overall chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, vibrant, corporate)?

  6. How would you like the "Beginning" of enrollment to be highlighted or represented
  on the chart?

  7. Do you have preferences for font types, sizes, or line styles used in the chart
  for better readability?'
