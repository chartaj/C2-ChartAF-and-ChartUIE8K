initial_prompt: I need a heatmap created to visualize the missing values of course
  information in German universities. Specifically, I want to see which columns have
  the most missing data to identify gaps in the dataset. Include columns such as Course
  ID, Course Name, Subject Name, University Name, City Name, Teaching languages, Required
  German language, Required English language, Beginning, Duration of Programme, and
  Tuition Fees. This will help in understanding which areas need more data collection
  or improvement. The heatmap should clearly display the percentage of missing values
  for each column.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity represent the percentage of missing values or another
  metric?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to include numerical annotations indicating the exact
  percentage of missing values?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend or color bar to explain the color coding?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the columns to be displayed?

  6. Do you want gridlines to separate the cells within the heatmap?

  7. Should the column labels be rotated or formatted in a specific way for better
  readability?

  8. Would you like to highlight or emphasize columns with the highest percentage
  of missing data?'
