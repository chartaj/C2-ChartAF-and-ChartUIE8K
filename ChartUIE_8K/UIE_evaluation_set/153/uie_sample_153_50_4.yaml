initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between variables X1,
  X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, Y1, and Y2 from the Energy Efficiency Dataset to identify
  patterns and relationships.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display only the correlation coefficients numerically,
  or do you prefer a gradient color representation?

  3. Should the heatmap include axis labels for clarity on each variable?

  4. Do you prefer to include a title and subtitle for the heatmap for context?

  5. Would you like to include annotations for the correlation values directly on
  the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend or color bar to indicate the range of correlation
  values?

  7. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include axis labels for clarity.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include a legend or color bar.

  7. I am not sure.'
