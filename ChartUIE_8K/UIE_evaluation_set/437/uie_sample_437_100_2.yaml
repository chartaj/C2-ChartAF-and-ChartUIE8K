initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the appearance count of X-men characters
  in Chris Claremont comics. The x-axis should represent different characters, while
  the y-axis will show the number of issues they appear in. Use text annotations to
  highlight characters with the highest appearances. Additionally, apply visual highlights
  to those characters for emphasis. This helps fans understand character prominence
  and storytelling focus in Claremont's work. Ensure the bar chart is easy to read,
  with labels and a clear title for context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the character names on the x-axis to be displayed at a specific
  angle or orientation for better readability?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  4. Do you want any specific design elements for the text annotations highlighting
  the characters with the highest appearances?

  5. Should the visual highlights for characters with the highest appearances use
  a specific color or pattern?

  6. Do you have a preference for the layout or spacing between the bars in the bar
  chart?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included, or is it unnecessary given the context?'
