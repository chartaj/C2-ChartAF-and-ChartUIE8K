initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the number of speeches, thoughts,
  narratives, and depictions for X-men characters from Chris Claremont comics. Add
  text annotations to highlight the top three characters in each category, focusing
  on their values. Use different colors to distinguish between each category of data.
  Include context about the characters' roles and highlight any character that appears
  uniquely significant in terms of speech, thoughts, or narrative contributions. Ensure
  it captures the distribution and comparison of these elements effectively for a
  clear, comprehensive view.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between the
  different categories (speeches, thoughts, narratives, depictions)?

  2. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the text annotations highlighting
  the top three characters in each category?

  3. Do you prefer certain axis labels or titles for the chart?

  4. Should the histogram bars be displayed in a particular order (e.g., sorted by
  the total count, alphabetically by character name)?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or design for including context about the charactersâ€™
  roles?

  6. Would you like any specific legend format or placement for the different categories?

  7. Should the chart include a specific title, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Do you want to use any specific shapes or markers alongside the text annotations
  to highlight the top three characters?'

  \ like \"X-Men Characters\" for the x-axis and \"Count\" for the y-axis. \n4. I\
