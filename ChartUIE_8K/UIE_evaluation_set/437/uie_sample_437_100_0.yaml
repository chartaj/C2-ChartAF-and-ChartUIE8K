initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the number of times each X-men
  character is depicted across different issues of Chris Claremont comics. Use data-driven
  text annotations to highlight key characters and their appearances. Add highlights
  to emphasize the characters in costumes versus those without. This will help in
  analyzing the narrative and character development trends over time. Include a legend
  to denote 'costume' and 'narrative' aspects. The purpose is to provide a visual
  representation that helps in understanding character prominence and thematic elements
  across the series.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting characters
  in costumes versus those without?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style for the data-driven text annotations?

  3. Should the x-axis (issues) be displayed in a continuous timeline or categorized
  by significant arcs/storylines?

  4. Are there any particular characters you want to make sure are especially highlighted?

  5. How detailed should the legend be in differentiating ''costume'' and ''narrative''
  aspects?

  6. Do you prefer specific fonts or sizes for the text in annotations and legends?

  7. Are there any specific comic issues or time periods you want to be particularly
  emphasized in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any specific markers or symbols to denote key events
  or milestones in the comic series?

  9. Do you want grid lines to be prominent, subtle, or omitted in the chart?'
