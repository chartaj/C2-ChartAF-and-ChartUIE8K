initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap to visualize the appearance of X-men characters
  in Chris Claremont comics. Use the dataset provided to compare the frequency of
  different characters across various issues. Focus on columns like 'issue', 'character',
  and 'speech', 'thought', 'narrative', and 'depicted'. Make sure the heatmap highlights
  how these variables interact with each character and issue. It should show where
  each character appears most frequently and their engagement type. This will help
  in understanding the character dynamics and their prominence in the comic series.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend or key to explain the color intensity?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., issues
  on the x-axis, characters on the y-axis)?

  4. Should the heatmap highlight any specific ranges or thresholds of frequency with
  distinct colors?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotations or labels for better clarity?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the font style or size used in the chart?

  7. Should the axis labels be rotated or formatted in a certain way to improve readability?

  8. Do you want to include gridlines or other separators between cells of the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to normalize the data (e.g., relative frequencies) or use raw
  counts in the heatmap?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include in the heatmap?'
