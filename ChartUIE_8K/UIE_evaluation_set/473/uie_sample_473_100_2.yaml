initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart using the given data. The x-axis should represent
  the 'date' from 2016/01 to the latest available in the data, and the y-axis should
  show the 'Value'. Each bubble's size should correspond to the 'Value' magnitude.
  Add text annotations to highlight significant changes or peaks in the 'Value' over
  time, aiming to draw attention to these critical points for better analysis. Use
  highlights to emphasize the most critical data points, making them visually distinct.
  The overall aim is to observe and analyze trends in the 'Value' over the given period.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or color
  palette used in the chart?

  2. How would you like the significant changes or peaks in the ''Value'' to be annotated?
  (e.g., specific text, arrows, circles around the bubbles)

  3. Are there any particular styling preferences for the text annotations (font size,
  color, weight, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or shape for the bubbles other than the default
  circular shape?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the size of the bubbles corresponding
  to ''Value'' magnitude?

  6. Is there a preferred range or scale type for the y-axis (linear, logarithmic)?

  7. How would you like the highlights for the most critical data points to be distinguished
  (different color, border, transparency)?

  8. Do you require grid lines on the chart? If so, do you have preferences for their
  style and color?

  9. Should the x-axis labels (dates) be displayed at a specific angle or orientation
  for better readability?

  10. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  11. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and labels for the axes (size,
  font, style, etc.)?

  12. Is there a maximum or minimum bubble size constraint that you would like to
  apply?'
