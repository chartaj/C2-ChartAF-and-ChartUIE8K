initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the "Value" column from the
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the different "Value" ranges, and the y-axis
  should represent the frequency of each range. This will help us understand the distribution
  of values over the given time period. We need this visualization to identify any
  patterns or trends in the data provided. Please ensure that the histogram is clearly
  labeled and easy to interpret, as it will be used for quick insights in government
  reports on monthly data analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Do you have specific value ranges for the bins, or should they be automatically
  calculated?

  3. Are there any preferred colors for the bars in the histogram?

  4. Do you require any particular labeling or annotation style for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  5. Should the histogram include gridlines for easier reading of values?

  6. Would you like a particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to include any specific legend or additional text on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall size and aspect ratio of the histogram?

  9. Should the histogram include an overlay of statistical information, such as a
  mean or median line?

  10. Are there specific time periods or ranges that should be highlighted or emphasized
  in the histogram?'
