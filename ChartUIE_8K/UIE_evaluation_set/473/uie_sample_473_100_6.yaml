initial_prompt: I need a donut chart illustrating the usage of different governmental
  programs over time. The data covers a span from 2016/01 to 2016/03 and includes
  monthly values. Each slice of the donut chart should represent the proportion of
  usage for that month. Please ensure the chart clearly differentiates between months
  and their respective values, perhaps by using distinct colors or shades. Additionally,
  a legend should be provided to explain which section pertains to which month. This
  visualization will help to easily compare the monthly usage and identify trends
  in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or color schemes that should
  be used for distinguishing the months?

  2. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like for the legend and
  labels?

  3. Do you need any specific labels or annotations apart from the month and value?

  4. Would you prefer the chart to have a 3D effect or stay in 2D?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Are there any specific background color or gridline preferences for the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  8. Should any specific information be highlighted or emphasized in the chart?'
