initial_prompt: I need a column chart that visualizes the data from the CSV file located
  at '../Extra_datas/data/473.csv'. I want to compare the monthly values over time.
  The x-axis should represent the 'date' column (each month), and the y-axis should
  represent the 'Value' column. Make sure the chart clearly shows the trend of values
  from January 2016 to the latest date in the dataset. The chart should be simple
  yet informative, suitable for a government report. Include axis labels and a title
  for the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the column chart?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability? If yes, in what style?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on the columns to show exact values?

  4. Would you like to highlight any specific months or values on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific format you would like for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ''Jan 2016'', ''2016/01'')?

  6. Should the y-axis have a specific range or intervals for better visualization?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or comments on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?'
