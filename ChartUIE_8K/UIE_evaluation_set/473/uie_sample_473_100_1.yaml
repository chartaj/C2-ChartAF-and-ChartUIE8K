initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the data from January 2016 to March
  2016. The x-axis should represent the months, and the y-axis should represent the
  'Value' observations. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight the actual 'Value'
  for each month, drawing attention to the change from 5.3 in January to 5.1 in March.
  Highlights should emphasize the decreasing trend in 'Value'. The purpose of this
  visualization is to analyze monthly fluctuations, helping to identify patterns or
  anomalies over time. This is for a government report, ensuring clear, contextual,
  and informative data representation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line and annotations?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  3. Should the y-axis have a fixed range or be auto-adjusted based on the data?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  5. Do you want to include a title for the chart or any other explanatory text?

  6. Should the chart include legend information, or is it unnecessary for this simple
  comparison?

  7. How would you like the highlighted areas for the decreasing trend to be visually
  indicated (e.g., color change, shaded region)?

  8. Do you prefer the x-axis labels to be in a specific date format (e.g., "Jan 2016",
  "January 2016")?

  9. Should we include any markers at each data point to make it easier to identify
  the values?

  10. Do you require any additional contextual information or callouts to be included
  in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a title: "Monthly ''Value'' Observations (Jan 2016 - Mar
  2016)".

  6. Legend information is unnecessary.

  7. I do not know.

  8. "Jan 2016", "Feb 2016", "Mar 2016" would be good.

  9. Yes, include markers at each data point.

  10. No additional contextual information needed.'
