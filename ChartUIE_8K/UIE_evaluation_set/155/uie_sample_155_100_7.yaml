initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the salary distribution of
  engineering graduates. Use the salary column as the primary axis and categorize
  the data by CollegeTier and Specialization. This will help us understand the variance
  in salaries based on college tier and engineering specializations. Additionally,
  include median salaries, interquartile ranges, and any outliers for clearer insights.
  This visualization is for a report on the correlation between educational background
  and salary outcomes in engineering graduates.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Would you prefer any specific ordering (ascending or descending) for Specialization
  or CollegeTier on the axis?

  4. Do you want the chart to show individual data points in addition to the box plot
  summary?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, any specific text for
  them?

  6. Do you want to display the values of median salaries explicitly on the chart?

  7. What level of detail do you want for the outliers (e.g., labeled with specific
  values or just highlighted)?

  8. Should the chart have a legend to differentiate between CollegeTier and Specialization
  categories?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I do not know.

  4. No, just the box plot summary.

  of Engineering Graduates by College Tier and Specialization".

  6. Yes, display the values of median salaries explicitly on the chart.

  7. Just highlight the outliers without specific values.

  8. Yes, the chart should have a legend to differentiate between CollegeTier and
  Specialization categories.
