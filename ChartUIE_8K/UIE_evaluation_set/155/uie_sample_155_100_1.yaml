initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart that visualizes the average Salary of engineering
  graduates based on Specialization. Use the data for annotations: highlight top 3
  specializations with highest salaries, and annotate with their respective average
  salaries to focus viewer''s attention. This chart helps in understanding which engineering
  specializations are most lucrative in terms of salary. The annotations should make
  it clear which specializations stand out, providing context for career decisions
  in the engineering field. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret, focusing on education''s
  impact on salary.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the bars, especially for
  the top 3 specializations with the highest salaries?

  2. Would you like the bars to be ordered in descending order of average salary?
