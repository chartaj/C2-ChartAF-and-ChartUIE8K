initial_prompt: Visualize a scatter plot that displays the relationship between the
  college GPA and salary of engineering graduates. Highlight data points based on
  their specialization using different colors. Add text annotations to showcase the
  top five highest salaries. Each point should represent a graduate, showing how higher
  GPA correlates with salary across different engineering specializations. Include
  axes for GPA and salary, with a legend indicating various specializations. The purpose
  of this chart is to help identify trends and outliers in GPA and salary across engineering
  disciplines, assisting educators and students in understanding the potential financial
  outcomes of various engineering specializations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting different specializations?

  2. Would you like specific markers or shapes for the data points of different specializations?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the range of the axes for GPA and salary?

  4. How would you prefer the top five highest salaries to be annotated? (e.g., with
  names, symbols, or additional text)

  5. Do you want grid lines to be visible on the chart?

  6. Should the legend display the specializations in a particular order?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations and labels?

  8. Are there any specific trends or outliers you are particularly interested in
  identifying?

  9. Would you like to include any additional information in tooltips when hovering
  over data points?

  10. Do you prefer a particular aspect ratio or size for the scatter plot?'
