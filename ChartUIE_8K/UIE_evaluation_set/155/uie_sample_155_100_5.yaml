initial_prompt: Create a line chart that displays the progression of average salaries
  over different graduation years for engineering graduates. Include separate lines
  for male and female graduates to visualize gender differences. Use "GraduationYear"
  on the x-axis and "Salary" on the y-axis. Highlight key academic metrics like college
  GPA, English scores, and Quant scores alongside salary trends for a comprehensive
  comparison. Ensure the chart is clear in showing differences across various specializations
  like computer science, electronics, and instrumentation engineering. This will help
  understand how academic background influences salary outcomes in the engineering
  sector.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different lines (male\
  \ and female graduates)?\n2. Would you like to include markers or points on the\
  \ lines to indicate specific data points?\n3. How would you prefer to display the\
  \ key academic metrics (college GPA, English scores, and Quant scores) on the chart?\
  \ \n4. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis labels?\n5. Would\
  \ you like to include a legend to differentiate the different specializations (computer\
  \ science, electronics, instrumentation engineering)?\n6. Should we use different\
  \ line styles (solid, dashed) for different specializations or for gender differentiation?\n\
  7. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the y-axis (Salary) and\
  \ x-axis (GraduationYear)?\n8. Do you have any preferences regarding the font sizes\
  \ or types for the labels and titles?\n9. Would you prefer the chart to be grid-lined\
  \ for better readability or keep it clean?\n10. Are there any specific annotations\
  \ or highlights you want to be included for key data points or trends?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include markers or points on the lines to indicate specific
  data points.

  3. I prefer to display the key academic metrics (college GPA, English scores, and
  Quant scores) as sidebars or a secondary y-axis for comparison.

  4. For the chart title, you can use "Average Salaries of Engineering Graduates Over
  Years by Gender and Specialization". Axis labels can be "Graduation Year" for the
  x-axis and "Average Salary (in USD)" for the y-axis.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate the different specializations.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I prefer the chart to be grid-lined for better readability.

  10. I am not sure.'
