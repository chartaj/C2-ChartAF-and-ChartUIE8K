initial_prompt: I have data on California housing prices, including various attributes
  like longitude, latitude, and median house value. I want to create a Donut chart
  to visualize the 'ocean_proximity' distribution across different categories ('NEAR
  BAY', etc.). This will help understand how many houses fall into these proximity
  categories, highlighting the frequency of each. Please use the column 'ocean_proximity'
  for the Donut chart and ensure each segment represents a different category. This
  visualization will provide insights into the geographic distribution of the housing
  market. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different segments of the
  Donut chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the Donut chart rings?

  3. Should the segments of the chart have labels indicating the percentage or the
  count of houses in each category?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the categories in the Donut chart,
  and if so, where should it be placed (e.g., beside the chart, below the chart)?

  5. Do you want the chart to display the exact numerical values within each segment?

  6. How would you like the chart title to be worded, and where should it be positioned
  (e.g., centered, aligned left)?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the segments of the chart should have labels indicating the percentage of
  houses in each category.

  4. Yes, I would like to include a legend explaining the categories. I am not sure
  where it should be placed.

  5. I do not have a preference.

  6. Please title the chart "Distribution of California Housing by Ocean Proximity"
  and position it centered.

  7. I do not have a specific font style or size preference.'
