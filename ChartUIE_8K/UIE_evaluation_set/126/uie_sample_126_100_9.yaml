initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the California housing prices
  data. The chart should compare the median house values across different ocean proximity
  categories. Use the 'median_house_value' for the y-axis and 'ocean_proximity' for
  the x-axis. Ensure each bar represents one of the five unique ocean proximity categories.
  This will help in understanding how housing prices vary based on proximity to the
  ocean. Include a legend to differentiate the categories and make the chart colorful
  and easy to read. Ensure the chart is labeled appropriately for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  legend?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If yes, do you have any specific preferences
  for their style or color?

  4. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. How would you like the data values to be displayed on the chart (e.g., above
  each bar, within the bar, or not displayed)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the title and subtitle of the chart?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the chart? If yes, please
  specify.

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the ocean proximity categories to
  appear on the x-axis?'
