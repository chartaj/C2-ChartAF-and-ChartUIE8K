initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of median
  house values from the California Housing Prices dataset. Ensure that the x-axis
  represents different ranges of median house values and the y-axis represents the
  frequency of houses within each range. Highlight any significant skewness or peaks
  in the data. This will help in understanding the spread of housing prices and identifying
  any common pricing trends. Also, consider overlaying a distribution curve to get
  a better insight into the overall distribution. Make sure the histogram bins are
  appropriately sized for clear visibility.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you like for the histogram bars and distribution curve?

  3. Should any specific ranges on the x-axis be highlighted or annotated?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the distribution curve (e.g., smooth curve,
  step line)?

  5. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the overall chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed, corporate)?

  6. Do you want any grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, vertical, horizontal,
  or both?

  7. Would you like to add any labels or annotations to highlight significant skewness
  or peaks? If so, what kind?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the title and labels of the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Would you like the chart to include a legend describing the distribution curve?

  10. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the chart labels and text
  (e.g., font size, font family)?'
