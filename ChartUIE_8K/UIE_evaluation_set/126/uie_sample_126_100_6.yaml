initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart visualizing the California Housing Prices dataset.
  Specifically, I want to see the distribution of median_house_value across different
  categories of ocean_proximity. This way, I can compare housing prices near the ocean
  versus inland. Include the median, quartiles, and possible outliers for each ocean_proximity
  category. Ensure the chart is clearly labeled and color-coded accordingly with an
  appropriate legend. This will give me a clear understanding of how housing prices
  vary by proximity to the ocean. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different categories
  of "ocean_proximity"?

  2. Would you prefer any particular styling or format for the labels on the chart?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines or any other background features for better
  readability?

  4. Do you have a preferred position for the legend on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight
  particular insights?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for colors.

  2. I am not sure about any particular styling or format for the labels.

  3. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  4. I do not have a preferred position for the legend.

  5. I am not sure about including specific annotations or notes.'
