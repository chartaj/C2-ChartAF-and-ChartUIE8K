initial_prompt: Create a Geographic heatmap visualizing California housing prices,
  with data points representing different locations. Use color to indicate median
  house values, highlighting the most expensive and least expensive areas. Include
  text annotations to show the exact values of outlier data points, such as unusually
  high or low house prices. Ensure the heatmap displays dimensions like longitude,
  latitude, median income, and housing median age to provide context. The chart's
  purpose is to identify regional trends in housing prices and factors influencing
  them. Highlight regions near the bay for focused analysis. Ensure missing values
  are appropriately handled.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or gradient preference for indicating
  the median house values on the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer any specific styling for text annotations, such as font size
  or color?

  3. Should there be a specific symbol or marker for outliers, and if so, what kind?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range or number of color intensity levels?

  5. How would you like the regions near the bay to be highlighted for focused analysis
  (e.g., different color, border)?

  6. Do you have a preference for how missing values should be represented or handled
  in the heatmap?

  7. Would you like a legend to interpret the colors used, and if so, do you have
  styling preferences for it?

  8. Is there a specific map style or base map you prefer (e.g., satellite view, street
  map)?'
answers: "1. I am not sure about a specific color scheme or gradient. \n2. I do not\
  \ know about styling for text annotations.\n3. I would prefer a distinct symbol\
  \ for outliers, maybe a star or a different color marker.\n4. I don't have a specific\
  \ preference for the range or number of color intensity levels.\n5. Highlight regions\
  \ near the bay with a different color.\n6. I am not sure how missing values should\
  \ be handled.\n7. Yes, I would like a legend, but I have no specific styling preferences.\n\
  8. I have no specific preference for the map style."
