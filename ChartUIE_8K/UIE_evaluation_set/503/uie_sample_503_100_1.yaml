initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the population growth of different
  cities using the provided data columns 'name', 'pop', 'lat', and 'lon.' Annotate
  with trend lines to highlight population trends over time. Include highlights to
  emphasize major cities and their population shifts visually. The chart should help
  in analyzing urban population distribution and growth patterns. Utilize shapes to
  enclose cities with significant population changes. This visualization helps in
  understanding demographic changes and urban planning. Ensure the chart clearly represents
  the data with appropriate labels and scales for practical insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the trend lines to be dashed or solid?

  3. Do you have any specific cities that should be highlighted or emphasized?

  4. Should the major cities be annotated with labels directly on the chart?

  5. What kind of shapes would you prefer to enclose cities with significant population
  changes (e.g., circles, rectangles)?

  6. Are there any specific time intervals you would like for the x-axis (e.g., yearly,
  quarterly)?

  7. Do you prefer the y-axis to be in log scale or linear scale for population values?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend? If so, where should it be placed?

  9. Is there a specific font style and size you would prefer for the labels and annotations?

  10. Do you have any requirements for the chart''s title or subtitle?'
