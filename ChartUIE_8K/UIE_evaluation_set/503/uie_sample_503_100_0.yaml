initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the population distribution for different
  cities. The chart should use the 'pop' column to showcase the range, median, and
  outliers in city populations. Highlight the most populous cities like New York,
  Los Angeles, and Chicago with a different color to emphasize their significance.
  Add a trend line to illustrate any general trends in the population data. This will
  provide a clear understanding of how populations vary across cities. Highlighting
  certain cities visually will help in quickly identifying key insights from the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for highlighting the
  most populous cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago?

  3. Is there a particular format or style you prefer for displaying the range, median,
  and outliers (e.g., solid lines, dashed lines, dot markers for outliers)?

  4. Would you like the chart to include additional labels or annotations for the
  most populous cities and significant outliers?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the inclusion or exclusion of grid lines
  or axis labels on the chart?

  labels, and annotations?'
