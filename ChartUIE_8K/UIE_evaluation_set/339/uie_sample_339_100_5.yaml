initial_prompt: I want a choropleth map showing the average prices of food items in
  different countries from 2018 to 2022. The map should color-code each country by
  the average price in USD. Include a legend to show the price ranges. Make sure to
  highlight any significant price differences across the countries. Data covers five
  countries, so it should be easy to distinguish between them. Please use data from
  the "Country" and "Price in USD" columns for this map. The title should be "Global
  Food Prices Comparison (2018-2022)" and ensure all values are correct and clear.

  2. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the map?

  3. Do you want to use specific geographical boundaries or shapes for the countries?

  4. How detailed should the label information be for each country on the map?

  5. Do you have specific price ranges you want to define for the legend?

  6. Should there be annotations or markers for countries with significant price differences?

  7. Would you like to include additional information such as data sources or notes
  on the map?

  to use?'
