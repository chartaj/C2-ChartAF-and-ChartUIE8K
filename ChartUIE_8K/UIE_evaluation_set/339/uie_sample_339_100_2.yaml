initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot comparing the average price of food items to
  their prices in USD for different countries from 2018 to 2022. Use color coding
  to differentiate between different food items and countries. Include text annotations
  to highlight the highest and lowest prices. Emphasize years 2020 and 2021 with highlights
  to show trends or changes during these specific periods. Add a title: “Vital Food
  Costs: A Five-Nation Analysis 2018-2022.” The X-axis should represent the average
  price, and the Y-axis should show the price in USD. This will help understand the
  variations in food costs across different nations and currencies.'
