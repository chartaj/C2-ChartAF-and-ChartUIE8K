initial_prompt: 'I need a histogram showing the distribution of average bread prices
  in Australia for each month in 2018. Please use data columns: ''Month '', ''Average
  Price '', and ''Food Item '' from the dataset "Vital Food Costs: A Five-Nation Analysis
  2018-2022." The histogram should have the months on the x-axis and the average price
  on the y-axis. Please label the months and prices clearly, and use a distinct color
  to differentiate each bar in the histogram. Ensure the histogram is easy to understand,
  reflecting price trends over the months.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram bars?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  size, font style)?

  4. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the histogram to follow (e.g.
  minimalistic, colorful, professional)?

  5. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the histogram
  to highlight specific points?

  6. Should the histogram include grid lines for easier reading of the values?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included, even if it might be redundant for a single-category
  histogram?'
