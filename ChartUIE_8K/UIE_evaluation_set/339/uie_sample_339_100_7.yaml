initial_prompt: I want to create a line chart that shows the average prices of food
  items in different countries over time, from 2018 to 2022. The X-axis should represent
  the months, and the Y-axis should show the average price in USD. Each line should
  represent a different country for easy comparison. Ensure the chart includes labels,
  a legend, and different colors for each country. This will help visualize how food
  prices have fluctuated across various regions over these years. Focus on Bread,
  as it seems to be a common item available in the sample data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific line styles or thickness preferences for each
  country?

  2. Do you have any preferred color palettes for differentiating the countries?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would prefer for labels and legends?

  6. Do you want to include data markers (e.g., dots or circles) at each data point
  on the lines?

  7. Is there a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or specific notes on the chart to highlight
  significant events or changes?

  9. Do you have a particular format or style for displaying dates on the X-axis (e.g.,
  MM/YYYY)?

  10. Should the Y-axis start at zero, or would you prefer it to auto-scale based
  on the data range?

  11. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?'
