initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the average food item prices
  in USD for different countries from 2018 to 2022. Ensure the x-axis represents the
  countries, and the y-axis shows the average price in USD. Use the "Food Item" column
  for grouping each country's data. This will help compare the price distributions
  across the different food items and identify any outliers. The box chart should
  be detailed enough to see the price variations within each group for a comprehensive
  analysis within the specified years and currency. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or themes for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels or annotations for specific data points, such
  as outliers?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to see any additional statistical values (e.g., mean, median)
  displayed on the chart?

  6. How would you like the outliers to be represented (e.g., specific symbols or
  colors)?

  7. Should the box chart include a legend to distinguish between different food items?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the countries to be arranged on the
  x-axis?

  9. Do you want any specific range or limits set for the y-axis values?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to highlight any major trends or patterns?'
