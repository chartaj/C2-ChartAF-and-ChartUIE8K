initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the number of Reddit posts
  about COVID-19 vaccines by their score, with separate bars for each unique title.
  Highlight posts about AstraZeneca. Annotate key data points like the highest and
  lowest scores and any significant gaps in scores. This will help understand the
  distribution and reception of different posts. Provide context about the timing
  of these posts, especially around critical dates for vaccine approvals. Add editorial
  comments for clarity on less obvious data trends. Use different colors to distinguish
  between posts and make highlights stand out visually.
