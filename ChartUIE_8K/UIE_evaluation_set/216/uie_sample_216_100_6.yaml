initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the global air transport data from 2005
  to 2020. Each cell should represent the registered carrier departures for different
  countries and years. Use a color gradient to depict the number of departures, with
  darker shades for higher values. Make sure to handle missing data appropriately
  by either marking or excluding it. Provide separate columns for each year and rows
  for each country coded by their respective names. Include a legend for clarity and
  ensure the map is easily interpretable for both data analysts and stakeholders.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like missing data to be handled: marked explicitly or excluded?

  3. Do you want any specific annotations on the heatmap for better clarity?

  4. What level of detail should the legend include?

  5. Is there a specific order in which countries should be displayed (e.g., alphabetically,
  by number of departures)?

  6. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to highlight or focus on
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for country names and years?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines for better cell separation, and if so, how
  prominent should they be?

  9. Are there any particular thresholds for the number of departures that you would
  like to mark or emphasize?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Mark missing data explicitly.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Detail enough to differentiate various ranges of departures.

  5. Alphabetically.

  6. I do not have specific countries or regions to highlight.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, include gridlines. I do not know how prominent they should be.

  9. I am not sure.'
