initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing average Duration by VRHeadset. Highlight
  the VRHeadset with the highest average Duration and annotate it. This will help
  in understanding user engagement with different VR headsets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to have a specific color pattern, such as different colors
  for each VR headset, or the same color with varying shades?

  3. How would you like the VRHeadset with the highest average Duration to be highlighted?
  (e.g., different color, border, etc.)

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines for easier reading of values?

  5. Should the chart include data labels displaying the exact average Duration on
  each bar?

  6. Would you like to see the values on the y-axis as they are or rounded to a certain
  number of decimal places?

  7. Do you want any specific font style or size for the chart title, axis labels,
  and annotations?

  8. Should the bar chart include a legend, or is it not necessary since there are
  only a few categories?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the annotation for the VRHeadset with
  the highest average Duration to appear (e.g., arrow pointing to the bar, text box
  above the bar)?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to have any particular layout or orientation (e.g.,
  horizontal bars instead of vertical)?'
