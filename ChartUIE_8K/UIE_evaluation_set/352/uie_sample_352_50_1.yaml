initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the relationship between Age and Duration
  of VR usage. Annotate key points at maximum and minimum Duration values. Highlight
  differences based on VRHeadset using distinct colors for each headset type. Include
  a brief description of how MotionSickness impacts ImmersionLevel.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for each VR
  headset type?

  like to see?

  8. Would you like any specific chart title or subtitle to be included?

  9. Should there be any emphasis on the axis scales or labels (e.g., logarithmic
