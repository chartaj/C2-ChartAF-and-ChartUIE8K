initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing "Duration" versus "MotionSickness"
  for different "VRHeadset" types. Annotate the highest and lowest "MotionSickness"
  points. Highlight points where "ImmersionLevel" is maximum. Aim to evaluate the
  relationship between VR usage duration and motion sickness across different headsets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing different VR
  headset types?

  2. How would you like the high and low motion sickness points to be annotated (specific
  text, symbols)?

  3. Should the highlighted points for maximum immersion level have a specific shape
  or color?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the axes (grid lines, labels format)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  on the chart?

  6. What range should be used for the x-axis (''Duration'') and y-axis (''MotionSickness'')?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  8. Should we include any trend lines or regression lines to further highlight the
  correlation between "Duration" and "MotionSickness"?

  9. How detailed should the tooltips be when hovering over data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. You can use specific symbols like a star for the highest and a square for the
  lowest.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, I would like a legend. Please position it on the right side of the chart.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.'
