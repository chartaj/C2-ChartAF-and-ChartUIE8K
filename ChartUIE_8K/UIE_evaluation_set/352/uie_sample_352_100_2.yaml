initial_prompt: Create a bar chart illustrating the average Duration of VR sessions
  grouped by Age categories, colored by Gender. Annotate significant data points where
  MotionSickness or ImmersionLevel is higher than average, to emphasize notable user
  experiences. Highlight VR Headset categories to observe any equipment influence.
  Ensure the chart is intuitive for interpreting how age, gender, and headset type
  impact VR session duration and related user experiences, aiming to provide insights
  for improving virtual reality experiences based on user demographics and technical
  influences.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the gender categories?

  2. Should the age categories be grouped in specific ranges (e.g., 10-20, 21-30)?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the annotations?

  5. How would you like significant data points to be annotated (e.g., with symbols,
  different colors)?

  6. Is there a specific way you want the VR headset categories to be highlighted
  (e.g., different shades, patterns)?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the legend?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the chart?

  9. Do you want any specific information in tooltips when hovering over the bars?

  10. Are there any particular formatting preferences for displaying the duration
  values (e.g., decimal places, units)?'
