initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationship between Age, VRHeadset
  types, and ImmersionLevel from the Virtual Reality Experiences dataset. Use different
  color scales to indicate varying levels of immersion.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for indicating varying
  levels of immersion?

  2. Should the age groups be bucketed into specific ranges, or use individual ages?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to display the exact numerical values of immersion levels,
  or just the color intensity?

  4. Would you like any particular VR headset types to be highlighted or distinguished
  in any way?

  5. Do you require any labels, annotations, or legends to be included or customized
  on the heatmap?

  6. Would you like the heatmap to include axis titles and if so, what should they
  be?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Just the color intensity.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include axis titles: "Age" for the x-axis, "VRHeadset types" for
  the y-axis.'
