initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing Internet Users by Country. Each bar should
  represent a country, with the height indicating the number of internet users. Add
  text annotations for the United States, China, and Germany, highlighting their specific
  user numbers. Use highlights to emphasize the countries with the highest and lowest
  numbers of internet users to draw attention to these facts. This visualization will
  help compare internet usage across different countries and identify significant
  trends or disparities in technology adoption. Focus on making it clear and easy
  to understand.
