initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization showing Internet Users by Country.
  Use the provided data to map each country into proportionate blocks based on the
  number of internet users. Highlight countries like the United States, China, and
  Germany for a detailed look at their data points. Add text annotations to display
  the exact number of internet users for these highlighted countries to draw the viewer's
