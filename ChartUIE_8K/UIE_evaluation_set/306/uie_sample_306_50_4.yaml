initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing net migration across different countries
  over the years. Highlight regions with highest internal displacements from conflict
  and disasters. Use color gradients to depict values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for depicting net migration
  values?

  2. How would you like the regions with highest internal displacements from conflict
  and disasters to be highlighted (e.g., specific color, border, intensity)?

  3. Should the map display data for each year separately, or would you prefer an
  aggregated view over a range of years?

  4. Do you have a specific projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) you prefer for the
  world map?

  5. Do you want any specific annotations or labels on the map (e.g., country names,
  values)?

  6. Would you like a legend to explain the color gradients and highlighted areas?
  If so, where should it be placed on the map?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the text on the
  map?

  8. Should any specific regions, countries, or areas be emphasized or marked in a
  special way?'
