initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing migration data across different
  countries and years. Display categories such as refugees, asylum seekers, and child
  migrants proportionally. Annotate specific data points like the highest number of
  emigrants per year to highlight trends. Use highlights to emphasize key countries
  with notable migration patterns. The purpose is to understand migration changes
  over time and the distribution among various categories. The chart should inform
  policymakers and researchers on migration impacts. Ensure visual clarity for easy
  comparison between countries and years.
