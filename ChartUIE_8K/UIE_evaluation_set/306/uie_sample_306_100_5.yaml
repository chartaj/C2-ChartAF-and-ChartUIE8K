initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the "Net
  migration" values over the years in the given dataset. Since the data spans various
  years and countries, it would be helpful to separate the histogram bars based on
  different decades (e.g., 1950s, 1960s). This way, we can observe the migration patterns
  across different time periods and understand any significant shifts or trends in
  migration flows. Ensure to label the x-axis with the decades and the y-axis with
  the frequency of the "Net migration" values to provide clear insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines to enhance readability?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels?

  4. Would you like to add a title to the histogram? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Do you prefer any specific size or aspect ratio for the histogram?

  6. Should the y-axis use a linear or logarithmic scale?

  7. Would you like to include annotations for any specific data points or decades?

  8. Do you need a legend to display additional information about the decades?

  9. Is there a specific style you prefer for the histogram bars, such as solid, patterned,
  or outlined?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines to enhance readability.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, please title it "Net Migration Distribution Across Decades".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. A linear scale for the y-axis.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, a legend is not necessary.

  9. I do not have a specific preference.'
