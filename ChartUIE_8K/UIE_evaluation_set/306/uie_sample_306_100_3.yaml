initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize migration trends over time. Plot
  the "Net migration" as the primary y-axis variable and "Year" on the x-axis. Highlight
  variations and trends in different periods specifically for the region "Central
  and Southern Asia." This could help identify migration patterns, policy impacts,
  and economic influences. Consider adding labels for significant peaks or drops to
  provide more context. Use different colors or markers to denotate different data
  points. Include a legend for clarity and ensure the chart is easy to interpret for
  both experts and the general public.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different data points
  or periods?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  3. Is there a particular way you want significant peaks or drops to be labeled (e.g.,
  using annotations, data labels)?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the chart?

  6. Should the line style (solid, dashed, dotted) be adjusted for different periods
  or categories?

  7. Are there any particular legends or annotations that you want to make sure are
  included or emphasized?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines in the chart?

  9. Should the markers on the data points have a specific shape (e.g., circle, square,
  triangle)?

  10. Do you want the chart to include a title and subtitle? If so, could you provide
  the text for these?'
