initial_prompt: Please generate a heatmap visualizing the migration data, focusing
  on metrics like "Refugees by origin," "Asylum seekers by destination," and "International
  immigrants (% population)." Use text annotations to highlight years with significant
  values or trends. Include highlights for countries with notable figures to emphasize
  their importance. This will help in understanding migration patterns and trends
  over time. The annotations should provide context and make the heatmap more informative.
  Ensure that the visualization is clear and can help in drawing insights on global
  migration patterns and their impact.
