initial_prompt: I have IBM stock data with columns Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and
  Volume. I want a scatter plot visualizing this data. Please create a scatter plot
  where the x-axis represents the Date and the y-axis represents the Close prices.
  Use different colors for each year to distinguish them easily. Also, ensure the
  plot title is "IBM Stock Close Prices Over Time." Labels for the x-axis as "Date"
  and y-axis as "Close Price" would be helpful. Additionally, please add a legend
  to indicate the colors corresponding to each year.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  the years?

  2. Would you like the scatter plot to include any specific markers for the data
  points?

  3. Should the x-axis be formatted in a particular way, such as including only the
  start of each month or year?

  4. Are there any specific font preferences for the title, axis labels, and legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the legend on the plot?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included or excluded in the plot?

  7. Is there a specific range for the y-axis (Close Prices) that you''d like to set,
  or should it be adjusted automatically?

  8. Do you want to include any annotations or callouts for significant dates or events
  in the scatter plot?'
