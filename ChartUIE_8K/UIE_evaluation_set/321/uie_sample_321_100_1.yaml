initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing IBM stock data. Use the columns
  Date, Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Ensure annotations highlight key data
  points like peak highs and lows to draw attention to significant trends. Add non-data-driven
  annotations for context. Emphasize unique values and distinguish between trading
  volumes. This visualization will aid in business analysis by showcasing historical
  stock performance and volume variations. Include textual annotations where necessary
  to explain unusual patterns or significant dates. The purpose is to facilitate easier
  comprehension of historical stock behavior and support investment decisions.
