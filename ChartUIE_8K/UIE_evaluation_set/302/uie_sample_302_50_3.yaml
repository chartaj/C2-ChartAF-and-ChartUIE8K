initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the trend of carbon dioxide emission
  rates over the years using the 'Year' and 'Trend' columns. Highlight differences
  over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity represent the magnitude of the emission rates directly,
  or do you prefer a specific range of colors for different rate intervals?

  3. Would you like the years to be displayed on the x-axis or y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a specific labeling format for the axes (e.g., "Year" vs "Years")?

  5. Should we include any annotations or markers to highlight significant changes
  or trends?

  6. Do you have a preferred grid size for the heatmap cells (e.g., yearly, monthly)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding?

  8. Are there specific years or ranges of years you want to highlight or emphasize?

  9. Should there be any additional contextual data or information to be included
  alongside the heatmap (e.g., major environmental events)?

  10. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the heatmap to provide context?

  11. Should any specific labels or notes be included for outliers or significant
  data points?'
