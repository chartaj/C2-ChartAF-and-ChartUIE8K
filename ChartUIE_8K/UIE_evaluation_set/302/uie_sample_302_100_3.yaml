initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap visualizing the Carbon Dioxide Emission
  Rates over the years from the data provided. Specifically, I need the heatmap to
  display the 'Year' on the y-axis and 'Decimal_Date' on the x-axis to show how CO2
  levels ('Average') vary over time. Use color intensity to represent the CO2 levels.
  Ensure the heatmap clearly indicates trends and interpolated data can also be overlayed
  or shown as a comparison layer. The data spans from 1958, so make the timeline extensive
  enough to capture long-term trends. Highlight any significant changes or patterns
  in emission rates.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to highlight any specific ranges of CO2 levels with distinct colors?

  3. Should the heatmap include grid lines or borders between cells for clearer separation?

  4. Do you have a preference for the legend''s position on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include labels or annotations highlighting significant changes
  or patterns?

  6. Should the interpolated data be overlaid or shown as a separate layer in the
  heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style or format for the axis labels (e.g., font size,
  rotation, etc.)?

  8. Would you like to add any reference lines or markers for specific dates or CO2
  levels?

  9. Should tooltips or data labels appear when hovering over specific points in the
  heatmap?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the heatmap?'
