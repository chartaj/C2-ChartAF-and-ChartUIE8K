initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart visualizing the carbon dioxide emission
  rates from 1958 to present. Highlight key years with significant changes. Add text
  annotations to describe the Average, Interpolated, and Trend values at notable points.
  Emphasize years within the dataset to investigate historical emission trends. Highlight
  outliers to understand anomalies. Use the #Days data to provide context on the number
  of sampling days contributing to each year''s average. This visualization will help
  in understanding the long-term trend of carbon dioxide emissions for environmental
  science analysis.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting key years
  with significant changes?

  2. Would you like a specific style for text annotations (e.g., font size, bold,
  italics)?

  3. How would you like outliers to be displayed (e.g., different color, shape, or
  size)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular method for gridline and axis styling (e.g., dashed
  lines, thickness)?

  5. Is there a specific layout or positioning preference for the legend?

  6. Should we include any additional contextual data or notes alongside the #Days
  data?

  7. What level of granularity do you prefer for the time axis (e.g., yearly, decade,
  key events)?

  8. Would you like tooltips to describe the data points when hovering over them?

  9. Do you prefer any specific title or labeling format for the chart and its axes?

  10. Are there any additional details or embellishments you want included in the
  chart (e.g., background, watermark)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. Different color for outliers would be good.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I don''t know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yearly granularity would be preferred.

  8. No, I prefer an image, not an interactive visualization.

  9. I do not have a specific preference.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
