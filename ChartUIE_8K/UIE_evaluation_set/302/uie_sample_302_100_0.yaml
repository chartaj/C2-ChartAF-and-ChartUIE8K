initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the carbon dioxide emission rates
  from 1958 onwards. Focus on showing the trend and average values for each year.
  Highlight significant changes and annotate key data points to draw attention to
  important shifts or anomalies. Ensure clarity for environmental-science research,
  making it easy to identify trends over time. Use different colors for the trend
  and average values to distinguish them. The chart should cater to both quick insights
  and detailed examination of the data. Please make the chart visually engaging and
  informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to distinguish
  the trend and average values?

  2. Would you prefer the annotations for key data points to be text-based or symbol-based
  (e.g., arrows, circles)?

  3. Is there a preference for the font style and size used in the chart for annotations
  and labels?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the background color or gridline style
  in the chart?

  5. Should the chart have a title and subtitle? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  6. Are there any particular significant years or events you want to be specifically
  highlighted on the chart?

  7. Do you want the y-axis to be labeled with specific intervals, or should it be
  auto-scaled based on the data?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to describe the colors used, and if so, where
  should it be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, side)?

  9. Do you prefer any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratio to ensure clarity?'
