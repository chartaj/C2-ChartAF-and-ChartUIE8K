initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing CO2 levels (average of CO2[ppm], fit[ppm],
  and CO2Filled[ppm]) over the years. Highlight anomalies using text annotations for
  data points with essential drop or spike. Provide context with seasonality adjustments
  for each bar to understand trends better.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the anomalies be highlighted using specific colors or shapes for the text
  annotations?

  3. Do you prefer the text annotations for anomalies to be displayed side-by-side
  or above/below the respective bars?

  4. Is there a specific format for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis that you prefer?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart to enhance readability?

  6. Do you want the bars to have a specific style, such as solid, striped, or gradient?

  7. Should the legend include detailed descriptions of the seasonally adjusted values?

  8. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for the y-axis to ensure clear
  visualization of trends?

  9. Are you interested in including any additional contextual information, such as
  relevant events or policies, as annotations in the chart?

  10. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text labels and annotations?'
