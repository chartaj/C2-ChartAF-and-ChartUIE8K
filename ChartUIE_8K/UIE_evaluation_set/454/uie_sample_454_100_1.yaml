initial_prompt: I need a line chart that shows the market share of Desktop Windows
  versions from 2015 to 2019. The x-axis should display the years (2015-2019), and
  the y-axis should display the market share percentages. Highlight significant drops
  and rises, and use text annotations for data points of Windows XP, Windows 7, and
  Windows 8.1 to emphasize their market trends over the years. This will help in understanding
  the overall trend and shifts in popularity of each Windows version. Make the chart
  visually engaging to clearly communicate changes over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the lines representing different
  Windows versions?

  2. Would you prefer a dark or light theme for the chart background?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text annotations?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability? If so, should they
  be major, minor, or both?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Do you prefer a particular style for the data points (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  7. Are there any specific types of lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) you want
  to use to differentiate between Windows versions?

  8. Should the y-axis be labeled with percentage signs (e.g., 10%) or just numeric
  values (e.g., 10)?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  chart?

  10. Would you like to include any additional notes or captions outside of the chart
  area?'
