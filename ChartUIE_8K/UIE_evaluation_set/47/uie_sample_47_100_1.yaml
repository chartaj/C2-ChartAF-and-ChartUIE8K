initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the March 2022 Laptop data. Include
  the "brand" and "processor_name" on the x-axis and the "latest_price" on the y-axis.
  Annotate only the top five most expensive laptops to highlight their prices and
  models. Use highlights to emphasize laptops with discounts above 20%, making them
  stand out by changing their color. The visualization should focus on comparing different
  brands and processors in relation to their prices and discounts. Include a title
  and legend for clarity.
