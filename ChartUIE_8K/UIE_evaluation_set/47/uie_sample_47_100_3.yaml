initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the 2022 March Laptop data. I want
  the x-axis to show the different brands and the y-axis to represent the ratings.
  Use different lines to represent the star ratings, number of ratings, and the number
  of reviews for each brand. This chart will help visualize the user feedback on different
  laptop brands throughout the month. Ensure each line is clearly labeled and distinct
  colors are used for clear differentiation. This will help in analysis of consumer
  preferences and feedback trends in the computers-and-technology category.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''star ratings'', ''number of ratings'', and ''number of reviews''?

  2. What line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) would you prefer for the different
  lines on the chart?

  3. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines? If so, what style
  of markers would you prefer (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  4. Are there any specific brands you want to highlight or compare more closely on
  the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or labels to specific data points on the
  chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the background color or gridlines on the chart?

  8. Do you want the chart to include a title? If so, what should the title be?

  9. Should the y-axis scale be linear or logarithmic?

  10. Would you like to include any reference lines or bands to highlight certain
  rating thresholds or ranges?'
