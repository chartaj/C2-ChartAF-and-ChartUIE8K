initial_prompt: I have a dataset from March 2022 on laptops under the "computers-and-technology"
  category. I need a Treemap chart to visually represent the different brands available
  in this dataset and their respective models. Each rectangle should show the number
  of models and corresponding star ratings they have received. Use different colors
  for different brands, and within each brand, vary the shades to denote star rating
  levels. Include other details like processor generation, RAM type and size, and
  price ranges to add more layers of information. Ensure the Treemap is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for different brands?

  2. Do you have a preference for the shades used to denote different star rating
  levels?

  3. How would you prefer to display processor generation, RAM type, and size within
  each rectangle?

  4. Do you have a specific way you would like the price ranges to be represented?

  5. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the Treemap?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences for any labels or text within the Treemap?

  7. Any preferred layout for arranging the data labels inside each rectangle?'
