initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart showing where movies are available among Netflix,
  Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. Use the columns Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and
  Disney+ to determine the share of films on each platform. Highlight the larger shares
  clearly and make sure to label them properly. For clarity, use the available data
  details which mention that movies are being compared across these streaming services.
  This will help in understanding the distribution of movies across different online
  streaming platforms. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each streaming service
  in the pie chart?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to display the exact percentage values or just the
  platform names?

  3. Should the chart include a legend, or would you prefer direct labeling on the
  pie slices?

  4. Is there a particular font or style you would like for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like the larger shares to be highlighted in a specific way, such as
  using a distinct color or an outline?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the pie chart?'
