initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the availability of movies across different
  streaming platforms based on the provided dataset. The x-axis should represent the
  platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+), and the y-axis should list the
  movie Titles. The heatmap cells should show whether a movie is available on a specific
  platform (1) or not (0). This will help to quickly identify the distribution of
  movies across platforms. Ensure that missing data is handled appropriately, especially
  for the 'Rotten Tomatoes' column with missing values. Title the chart "Movies Availability
  on Streaming Platforms".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What should be the range of colors for indicating availability (1) and non-availability
  (0)?

  3. How would you like missing data for the ''Rotten Tomatoes'' column to be represented
  or handled in the heatmap?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the movie titles on the y-axis?

  5. What is your preferred layout for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or labels within the cells?

  8. Do you have a specific size or aspect ratio in mind for the heatmap?

  9. Do you prefer a certain orientation for the movie titles on the y-axis (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  10. Would you like a legend indicating what the colors represent on the heatmap?'
