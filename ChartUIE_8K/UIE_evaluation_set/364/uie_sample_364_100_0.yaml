initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram chart to visualize the distribution of movies
  across different streaming platforms: Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. Highlight
  the columns for each platform distinctly to show the availability of movies. Add
  data-driven text annotations for data points representing the highest and lowest
  counts of movies. The purpose is to identify the streaming service with the most
  extensive catalog and understand the distribution pattern. Use highlights to make
  critical data points stand out. This visualization helps in understanding the competitive
  landscape of streaming services.'
questions: '1. What color schemes or specific colors would you prefer for each platform
  (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+)?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size used in text annotations
  on the chart?

  3. How would you like the critical data points (highest and lowest counts) to be
  highlighted?

  4. Would you prefer a specific layout or arrangement for the histogram bars?

  5. Do you have a specific title or label preferences for the chart and axes?

  6. Are there any specific guidelines or style sheets (such as company branding)
  that should be followed for this visualization?

  7. Do you prefer the data values to be displayed on the bars or as separate text
  annotations?

  8. Is there a specific range or bin size you would prefer for the histogram bins?'

  1. Netflix could be red, Hulu green, Prime Video blue, and Disney+ purple.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  3. I am not sure, maybe use bold text or a different color for the critical data
  points?

  4. I do not know, as long as the information is clear.

  5. The title could be "Movie Distribution Across Streaming Platforms," and axis
  labels could be "Streaming Platforms" for the x-axis and "Number of Movies" for
  the y-axis.

  6. I do not have any specific guidelines.

  7. Data values could be displayed on the bars if it looks good.
