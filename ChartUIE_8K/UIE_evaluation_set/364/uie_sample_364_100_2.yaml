initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the Rotten Tomatoes scores versus
  the release year of movies available on Netflix. Highlight movies with a Rotten
  Tomatoes score above 95/100. Annotate the titles and scores of the top three movies
  (with the highest Rotten Tomatoes scores). The purpose is to identify trends over
  time and recognize highly-rated films. Use different colors to represent different
  streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). This will help in understanding
  the distribution and availability of top-rated movies across platforms.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different streaming
  services?

  2. Would you like the labels for the top three movies to be styled in a particular
  way?

  3. How would you prefer the highlight for movies with a Rotten Tomatoes score above
  95/100 to be displayed (e.g., different marker shape, color, or size)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis scales or labels?

  5. Should any specific grid lines or reference lines be included in the scatter
  plot?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for any text annotations
  or labels?'
