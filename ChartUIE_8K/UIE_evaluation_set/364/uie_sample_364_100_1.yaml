initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the availability of
  movies across Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. Annotate the chart to highlight
  key insights such as the number of movies available exclusively on each platform,
  as well as those available on multiple platforms. Add textual descriptions to give
  context about the age ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores of selected movies. Use
  highlights to distinguish between exclusive and shared content, and emphasize the
  most highly rated movies. This visualization will help understand the distribution
  of films across different streaming services.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing each streaming
  service in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include legend labels for exclusive and shared content?

  3. Are there any particular movies you would like to highlight or annotate in the
  chart?

  4. What style of annotations do you prefer for adding textual descriptions (e.g.,
  callouts, tooltips, labels)?

  5. Do you have a preference for how to display the age ratings and Rotten Tomatoes
  scores (e.g., color-coding, icons, textual labels)?

  6. How would you like the highest-rated movies to be emphasized (e.g., bold text,
  larger font size, different color)?

  7. What level of detail do you prefer for the age ratings and Rotten Tomatoes scores?
  Should they be shown for every movie or only for selected ones?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or typography styles you would like used in the
  chart?

  9. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal stacked bar chart?

  10. Is there a specific order you would like to see the streaming services arranged
  in the chart?'
