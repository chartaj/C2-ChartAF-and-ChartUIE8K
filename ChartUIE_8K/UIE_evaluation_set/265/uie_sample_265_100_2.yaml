initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot depicting Total Cases versus Total Deaths for
  each country. Each data point should represent a country, labeled with the country
  name. Highlight USA, India, and France with different colors or markers. Annotate
  the data points for these three countries with their corresponding Total Cases and
  Total Deaths to draw attention. This visualization will help compare the impact
  of COVID-19 across different countries by illustrating the relationship between
  the number of cases and the resulting deaths. Please focus on emphasizing the differences
  between high-impact countries and others.
