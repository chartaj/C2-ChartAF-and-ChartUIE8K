initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of COVID-19
  Total Deaths across different countries. The x-axis should represent the number
  of deaths ('Total\r\nDeaths'), and the y-axis should show the frequency of countries
  falling into those bins. This will help us understand how the number of deaths varies
  across different countries, which is especially useful for health analysis of the
  pandemic's impact globally. Additionally, use a bin size that captures the data's
  variation accurately. Make sure the data is clean before plotting (handle missing
  values).
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the histogram?

  3. How would you like to handle missing values in the data?

  4. Do you require any specific labels or annotations on the bins?

  5. Would you like a grid to be displayed in the background for better readability?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and title?

  7. Do you want to include a legend or any specific information in the chart?

  8. Are there any specific requirements for the appearance of the axes (e.g., line
  style, thickness)?

  9. Would you like the chart to highlight any specific ranges or thresholds?

  10. Do you have a preferred orientation for the histogram (vertical or horizontal)?
