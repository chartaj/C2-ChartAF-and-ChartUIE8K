initial_prompt: Create an area chart that shows the trading volume of oil and coal
  over time. The x-axis should represent the date, while the y-axis should show the
  trading volumes for both oil and coal. Use different colors to differentiate between
  oil and coal, and make sure the chart covers the entire date range from 2013-04-28
  to 2013-04-30. This will help visualize how the trading volumes for these two energy
  sources have changed over time. The chart should be clear and easy to read with
  a legend to distinguish between oil and coal.

  oil and coal?

  font size, border)?'
