initial_prompt: I have a dataset that contains information on the trading volume of
  oil and coal over time. Specifically, the data includes a 'date' column, 'oil' column,
  and 'coal' column, with no missing values. I need a box chart that can visualize
  the distribution of trading volumes for both oil and coal. The goal here is to compare
  the trading volume distributions of these two energy commodities over the recorded
  dates. Please create a box chart to help me identify any outliers and understand
  the overall variation in trading volumes for oil and coal. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to display the data points on the box chart?

  3. Do you need labels for the median, quartiles, and outliers on the chart?

  4. Should the box chart include a title and/or subtitle? If yes, please specify.

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Is there a need to include a legend for the chart to differentiate between oil
  and coal?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability?

  8. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  9. Should the axes be labeled explicitly, and if yes, what should the labels be?

  10. Do you have specific preferences for the range or scale of the y-axis values?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like the labels for the median, quartiles, and outliers to be displayed.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Trading Volume Distribution for Oil and Coal" and the
  subtitle can be left out.

  5. Vertical orientation would be preferred.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Energy Commodities" and the y-axis should
  be labeled "Trading Volume".

  10. I do not have specific preferences for the range or scale of the y-axis values.'
