initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the trading volume of oil and coal
  over time. Ensure the x-axis represents the 'date' and the y-axis represents the
  volume for both 'oil' and 'coal'. Highlight specific dates with notable trading
  volumes using text annotations to emphasize peaks or significant drops. Use different
  colors to distinguish between oil and coal bars to enhance clarity. The chart should

  in the visualization.
