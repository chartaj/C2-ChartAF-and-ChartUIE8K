initial_prompt: I have Japan LOTO7 raw data and want to visualize the relationship
  between the draw number and sum9 using a scatter plot. Each point should represent
  one draw. The x-axis should be the 'draw' column to represent the draw number, and
  the y-axis should be the 'sum9' to show the sum of main and bonus numbers. Please
  make sure each point is clearly marked, and the plot has appropriate axis labels
  and title for easy understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color for the points on the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like to include a trendline to highlight the correlation?

  3. How would you like the data points to be marked (e.g., circles, triangles)?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  6. Should the scatter plot include a legend, and if so, what information should
  it contain?

  7. Would you prefer to have any annotations or data labels on the points themselves?

  8. Do you have a specific size or aspect ratio in mind for the scatter plot?

  9. Are there specific ranges you want to set for the x-axis and y-axis, or should
  they be auto-scaled?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or text on the chart (e.g.,
  data source, notes)?'
