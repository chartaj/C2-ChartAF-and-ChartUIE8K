initial_prompt: I need a histogram visualizing the distribution of the 'sum7' and
  'sum9' columns from the Japan LOTO7 dataset. The histogram should show the frequency
  of different summed values. Additionally, I want another histogram that compares
  the 'odd7' and 'even7' columns to display the distribution of odd and even numbers
  within each draw. Please use different colors for each histogram and include a legend
  and axis labels. Ensure the visualizations clearly present how these values are
  distributed over the 507 draws in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. What specific range does each axis need to cover for better clarity?

  3. Do you prefer a particular bin size or number of bins for the histograms?

  4. Would you prefer a stacked histogram or side-by-side bars for better comparison?

  5. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  6. Are there specific font sizes or styles you want for labels and legends?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines to be included in the histograms for better readability?'
