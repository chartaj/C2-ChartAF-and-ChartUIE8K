initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the frequency of each main number appearing
  over time, highlighting peaks. Annotate significant drawdates and outliers to emphasize
  trends. Include even/odd distributions for added insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like significant drawdates to be annotated? (e.g., special markers,
  text labels)

  3. Is there a specific way you prefer outliers to be highlighted?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout of the even/odd distribution display?

  5. Should the time axis (e.g., drawdate) be segmented in a particular way? (e.g.,
  by months, years)

  6. Would you like to include a legend or key for better understanding the color
  intensities?

  7. Are there any specific number ranges or thresholds you want to highlight within
  the heatmap?'

  2. I prefer special markers.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. By months, please.

  6. Yes, include a legend or key.
