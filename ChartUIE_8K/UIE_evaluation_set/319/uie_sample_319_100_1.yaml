initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualization of the Japan LOTO7 raw data.
  The box plots should show the distribution of values for "main1" through "main7".
  Include text annotations for the median values of each box plot to highlight central
  tendencies. Also, use highlights to emphasize the range of values for each "main"
  column, drawing attention to outliers. The purpose of this visualization is to analyze
  and understand the spread and central patterns in the LOTO7 numbers.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the box plots or highlights?

  2. Would you like the whiskers of the box plot to extend to a specific range, such
  as 1.5 IQR (Interquartile Range), or should they encompass all data points?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or format for the text annotations showing the
  median values (e.g., font size, font color)?

  4. Should the outliers be represented in a particular way (e.g., specific marker
  style or color)?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be light or prominent?

  6. Should the axis labels (for both x and y axes) follow a specific style or format?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a title and subtitle? If yes, please provide
  the text and any style preferences.

  8. Do you prefer any specific layout for the legend, or should it be omitted entirely?

  9. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the chart area?

  10. Should the box plots be arranged vertically or horizontally?
