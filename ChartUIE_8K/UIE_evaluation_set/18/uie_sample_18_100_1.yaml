initial_prompt: Visualize the count of unique Pokémon types (type1) in a pie chart
  to show the distribution of different types. Use highlights for segments representing
  the top three most common types to distinguish them. Annotations should include
  the type name and its percentage of the total for these highlighted segments. This
  will help to understand the diversity and prevalence of Pokémon types in the dataset
  from The Complete Pokemon Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart segments?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations?

  3. Would you like to set a specific order for the types in the legend or leave it
  default?

  4. Do you want the chart to include a title? If so, please provide the title text.

  5. Should the chart display percentages or absolute values or both for each segment?

  6. Do you prefer labels to be shown inside or outside the pie chart segments?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart’s background color?

  8. Would you like to include a border around each segment of the pie chart?

  9. Is there any specific way you would like the top three most common types to be
  highlighted (e.g., with a different shade, bold border, or distinct patterns)?

  10. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed (top, bottom, left, right)?'
