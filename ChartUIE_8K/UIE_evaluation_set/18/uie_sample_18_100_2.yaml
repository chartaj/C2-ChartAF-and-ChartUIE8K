initial_prompt: Please create a Treemap chart using the Complete Pokemon Dataset to
  visualize the base_total of different Pokemon classified by their generation and
  type. Use text annotations to highlight the top 5 Pokemon with the highest base_total
  values. Highlight legendary Pokemon by changing their color to gold. Additionally,
  use other annotations to indicate the average base_total for each generation. This
  visualization will help understand the distribution of Pokemon strengths and emphasize
  significant elements like high base_total and legendary status. The dataset is vital
  for analyzing Pokemon characteristics across various categories effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different generations
  and types in the Treemap chart?

  2. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like the top 5 Pokemon with the highest base_total values to be displayed
  in a specific way (e.g., bolded, larger font)?

  4. Is there a specific method you prefer for indicating the average base_total for
  each generation (e.g., using lines, different shapes, or color gradients)?

  5. Do you have any preference for the layout or structure of the Treemap chart (e.g.,
  squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  6. Should there be any padding or separation between the different categories in
  the Treemap?

  7. Are there any additional labels or markers you would like included in the chart
  for clarity?'
