initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between
  the Pokémon's base total stats and their height (in meters). Use the "base_total"
  for the y-axis and "height_m" for the x-axis. Each point should represent a Pokémon
  from the dataset, with different colors for different Pokémon types (use the "type1"
  column to differentiate). This will help to see if there's any correlation between
  a Pokémon's size and its overall power level. Ensure to label the axes and include
  a legend for the Pokémon types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  represent the different Pokémon types?

  2. Would you prefer a particular style for the points (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the grid lines (e.g., dotted, solid, none)?

  4. Should the plot include a trend line to show the correlation more clearly?

  5. Do you want any specific font styles or sizes for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the size of the plot (e.g., width and height)?

  7. Would you like to include tooltips or labels for each point showing Pokémon names
  or other details?

  8. Are there any specific types of annotations you’d like on the plot (e.g., lines
  marking average height/total stats)?

  9. Would you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific location (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?

  10. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include for the
  chart?'
