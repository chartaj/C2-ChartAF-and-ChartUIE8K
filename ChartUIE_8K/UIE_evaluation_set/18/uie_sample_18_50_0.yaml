initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the resistance (against_* columns) of
  Pokémon across different types. Highlight stronger resistances with green and weaknesses
  with red. Annotate notable Pokémon names and their total base stats within the heatmap
  to provide context and draw attention to significant data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap, other than
  green for stronger resistances and red for weaknesses?

  2. Would you like to specify a particular font type or size for the annotations
  of notable Pokémon names and their total base stats?

  3. Should the annotations for Pokémon names and their total base stats appear in
  a specific color?

  4. Are there any specific Pokémon names you want to ensure are annotated within
  the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include any particular title or labels for the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preference for the arrangement of columns (types of resistance)
  in the heatmap?

  7. Should the axis labels include additional details, such as type effectiveness
  ratios or other contextual information?

  8. Do you desire gridlines or borders around each cell in the heatmap for enhanced
  clarity?'
