initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'base_total'
  attribute from the Complete Pokemon Dataset. This histogram should show how many
  Pokemon fall into each range of base total scores, revealing concentration areas.
  Make sure to label the x-axis as "Base Total" and the y-axis as "Number of Pokemon."
  Highlight key ranges and frequencies to understand overall Pokemon strengths. Aim
  for bins that effectively capture the variation and patterns in the data, giving
  insight into the relative strength distribution among the different Pokemon as classified
  in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  2. Are there specific key ranges or frequency intervals you would like us to highlight?

  3. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the histogram bars?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels within the histogram?

  5. Do you want a specific title for the histogram or should we keep it as "Histogram
  of Base Total Scores"?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Are there any additional details or statistics you would like to be displayed
  on the histogram, such as mean or median base total scores?'
