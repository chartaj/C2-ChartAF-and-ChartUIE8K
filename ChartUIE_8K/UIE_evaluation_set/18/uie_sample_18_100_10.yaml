initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the effectiveness of different Pokémon
  types against other types using the dataset. The x-axis should represent Pokémon
  types (type1), and the y-axis should show the effectiveness value (against_bug to
  against_water). This will help in understanding the vulnerability of each Pokémon
  type against others. Please use the provided data, "The Complete Pokemon Dataset,"
  focusing on their defensive stats. Ensure the box chart clearly shows the range,
  median, and any outliers in effectiveness to highlight the strengths and weaknesses
  of each type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and title?

  4. Do you want grid lines displayed on the chart?

  5. Should the box chart include annotations or labels for the median and any outliers?

  6. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., short type names vs. full type
  names)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or key for the colors used, even though each
  box represents a distinct type?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, the title should be "Effectiveness of Pokémon Types Against Others."

  3. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines displayed on the chart.

  5. Yes, please include annotations or labels for the median and any outliers.

  6. Short type names for the axis labels are fine.

  7. Horizontal orientation for the x-axis labels is preferred.

  8. I am not sure if a legend or key is necessary.'
