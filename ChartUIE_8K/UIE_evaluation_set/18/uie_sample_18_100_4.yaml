initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the average base stats (attack, defense,
  sp_attack, sp_defense, hp, and speed) of Pokémon, classified by their primary type
  (type1). Each bar should represent a different type, and the chart should compare
  the averages for each stat across all types. This will help me understand how the
  different types compare in terms of their base stats. The dataset you will use is
  "The Complete Pokemon Dataset" from the arts-and-entertainment category. Please
  ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like each type to be color-coded differently, or should all bars be
  in the same color?

  3. Should the bars be grouped by type or by stat?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on the bars showing the exact average values?

  6. Do you need a legend showing the color representation for each type or stat?

  7. Is there any specific order you want the Pokémon types to appear in the chart
  (e.g., alphabetical, by average stat value)?

  8. Do you want gridlines to be shown in the background for better readability?

  9. Should there be a title and axis labels on the chart? If so, what should they
  be?

  10. Would you like to have any specific annotations or highlights on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. The bars should be grouped by type.

  4. Vertically.

  5. Yes, please include data labels on the bars showing the exact average values.

  6. Yes, I would like a legend showing the color representation for each type or
  stat.

  7. No, I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, gridlines in the background would be helpful for readability.

  9. Yes, a title and axis labels would be great. The title could be "Average Base
  Stats of Pokémon by Primary Type," and the axis labels could be "Pokémon Type" for
  the x-axis and "Average Base Stats" for the y-axis.

  10. No specific annotations or highlights needed.'
