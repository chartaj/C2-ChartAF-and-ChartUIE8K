initial_prompt: Please create a line chart displaying the trend of 'base_total', 'hp',
  'attack', 'defense', 'sp_attack', 'sp_defense', and 'speed' across different 'pokedex_number'
  from The Complete Pokemon Dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different lines representing
  ''base_total'', ''hp'', ''attack'', ''defense'', ''sp_attack'', ''sp_defense'',
  and ''speed''?

  2. Would you like each line to have a distinct style (e.g., dashed, dotted, solid)?

  3. Should there be markers on the data points? If so, what kind of markers do you
  prefer (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels font style and size?

  5. Should we include a legend to identify each metric? If yes, where would you like
  it to be positioned (top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes,
  do you prefer both horizontal and vertical gridlines?

  7. Do you have specific preferences for the background color of the chart?

  8. Is there any specific range or scale you would like for the y-axis?

  9. Would you like to see trend lines or smooth lines to highlight general trends?

  10. Should the x-axis labels represent all ''pokedex_number'' values, or should
  they be displayed at specific intervals?'
