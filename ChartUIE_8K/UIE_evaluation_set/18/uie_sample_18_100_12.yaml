initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart using the Complete Pokemon Dataset.
  Group the bars by Pokemon name and compare their attack, defense, and speed stats.
  Each group should have three bars (attack, defense, speed) for easy comparison.
  Make sure each bar is labeled with the corresponding stat name and the chart title
  is “Comparison of Attack, Defense, and Speed Stats for Selected Pokemon” for clarity.
  Ensure the Y-axis shows stat values, and the X-axis lists the Pokemon names from
  the sample data provided.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing attack,
  defense, and speed?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and title?

  3. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability of stat values?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between attack, defense,
  and speed bars?

  5. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order (e.g., attack first, then defense,
  then speed) within each group?

  6. Do you have a preference for the width of the bars or spacing between the groups?

  7. Would you like to include value labels on top of each bar to show the exact stat
  values?

  8. Should the chart background be a specific color or pattern?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis titles and any additional text
  elements?'
