initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the annual Bitcoin stock market
  data over the years. Each point should represent a year's Open, High, Low, and Close
  values. Use text annotations to highlight significant data points, especially where
  there's a notable difference between High and Low values. Include shape annotations
  like trend lines to show performance trends over the years. This will help illustrate

  analysts or investors observing cryptocurrency trends.
