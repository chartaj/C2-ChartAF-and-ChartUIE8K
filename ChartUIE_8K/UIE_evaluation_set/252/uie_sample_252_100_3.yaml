initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the Bitcoin USD Stock Market data.
  The chart should have the Year on the x-axis and the Open, High, Low, Close prices
  on the y-axis. This will help us understand how the Bitcoin market trends over the
  years from 2021 to 2023. Please make sure to highlight any significant changes in
  the prices to show market volatility. Use different colors for Open, High, Low,
  and Close lines to distinguish them clearly. Include a legend for clarity. Also,
  if possible, highlight data points with tooltips for exact values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the Open, High, Low,
  and Close lines?

  2. Would you prefer a particular line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for each of
  the Open, High, Low, and Close lines?

  3. Is there a preferred range or scale for the y-axis you would like to specify?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines in the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for their style or color?

  5. Would you like the legend to be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels
  and legend?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the background color or overall theme of the
  chart?

  8. Are there any specific points or date ranges on the chart you want to be highlighted
  more prominently?

  9. Would you like markers for each data point, and if so, do you have a preference
  for their shape or size?'
