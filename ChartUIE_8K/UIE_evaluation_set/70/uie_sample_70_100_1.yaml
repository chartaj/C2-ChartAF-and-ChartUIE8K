initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Google (GOOG) stock data. Plot dates
  on the X-axis and corresponding closing prices on the Y-axis. Use text annotations
  to highlight key dates with the highest and lowest closing prices. Highlight these
  points with different colors and increased marker sizes to draw attention. This
  will help in understanding the stock's performance over time and identify significant
  trends or fluctuations. Make sure to include volume data as well, perhaps by varying
  the size of the scatter points or using a secondary axis for clearer insights.
