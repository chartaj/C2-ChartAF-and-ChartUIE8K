questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the data to be displayed on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis?

  3. Should the box plots include any specific statistical measures such as quartiles,
  median, or whiskers extent?

  4. How would you like significant fluctuations to be highlighted (e.g., specific
  colors, shapes, or sizes of text annotations)?

  5. Is there a specific range or threshold for what constitutes a ''significant fluctuation''
  that you would like to emphasize?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to focus on specific time periods (e.g., recent months,
  particular years)?

  7. Should volume be represented as a separate subplot or integrated into the same
  box chart with the stock prices?

  8. Do you want any particular labels or titles on the axes, or should we use the
  default labeling?'
