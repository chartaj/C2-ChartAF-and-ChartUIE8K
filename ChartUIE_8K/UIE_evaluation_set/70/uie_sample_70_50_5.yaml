initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for Google (GOOG) stock prices, showing the
  correlation between 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume' from
  2015 onwards. Use color gradients to indicate strength of correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include specific labels or annotations for high correlation
  values?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to display correlation values explicitly within each
  cell?

  4. How detailed should the color gradients be (e.g., fine-tuned gradients vs. more
  distinct, segmented colors)?

  5. Is there a specific range of dates you are most interested in within the timeframe
  from 2015 onwards?

  6. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines separating the cells?

  8. Do you want the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color gradient meanings?

  9. Are there any other styling preferences you have for the heatmap (e.g., background
  color, title placement)?

  10. Should the heatmap highlight any particular correlations or patterns of interest,
  if identified?'
