initial_prompt: Plot a line chart that visualizes the Google (GOOG) stock performance
  over time using the provided data. Display the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close'
  prices on the y-axis. Include lines for 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Adj Close' prices
  for comparison. Show volume as a secondary y-axis to provide additional context.
  Make sure to include appropriate labels and a legend for clarity. Use different
  colors for each line to distinguish between them easily. Keeping it in mind, the
  chart should help analyze stock trends over the time period provided in the dataset.

  8. Do you have any preferences for the format of the date labels on the x-axis (e.g.,

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or additional information to the chart
  to highlight specific events or trends?
