initial_prompt: I'd like a candlestick chart visualizing Google (GOOG) stock data
  from the CSV file. It should display the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices
  over time. Please ensure you include the date on the x-axis for reference. The chart
  should clearly indicate trends over the dataset period, helping to identify any
  significant changes in stock prices. Additionally, color-code it to distinguish
  between bullish and bearish trends. Include an adjustable time range to analyze
  specific periods. I need it to be clear and interactive if possible. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the specific color scheme to distinguish
  between bullish and bearish trends?

  2. How would you like the date format to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., ''YYYY-MM-DD'',
  ''MM/DD/YYYY'', etc.)?

  3. Do you have a preferred background color for the chart?

  4. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart for easier reference, and if so, in
  which color?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to highlight significant
  events or thresholds within the stock data?

  7. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the chart?

  8. Would you like to display any additional information in tooltips when hovering
  over individual candlesticks?'
