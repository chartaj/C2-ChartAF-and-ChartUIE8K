initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the diversity of the 'Series' and 'Wavelength'
  data presented. The Treemap will use different colors and sizes to illustrate unique
  'Series' categories and their corresponding 'Wavelengths'. Include text annotations
  to highlight specific 'l position' and 'p position' values for the most significant
  data points. This visualization will help to emphasize patterns in the 'Series'
  and 'Wavelength' distribution and draw attention to notable variations or outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different ''Series''
  categories?

  2. How would you like the size of each tile in the Treemap to be determined? Based
  on ''Wavelength'' or another attribute?

  3. Are there any particular colors you would like to use to indicate certain ''Wavelength''
  ranges?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the text annotations for ''l position'' and ''p position'' be highlighted
  in any specific way (e.g., bold, italic, different color)?

  6. Is there any specific order in which you would like the ''Series'' categories
  to be displayed?

  7. Do you want to include a legend that explains the color and size encodings?

  8. Are there any specific variations or outliers you are particularly interested
  in highlighting?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I would like the size of each tile in the Treemap to be determined based on ''Wavelength''.

  3. I am not sure about specific colors for ''Wavelength'' ranges.

  4. I do not know. No specific preference for font style or size.

  5. Yes, please highlight the text annotations for ''l position'' and ''p position''
  in bold.

  6. I do not have a specific order in mind for the ''Series'' categories.

  7. Yes, please include a legend that explains the color and size encodings.

  8. I am not sure about specific variations or outliers to highlight.'
