initial_prompt: Visualize the physics data as a scatter plot to highlight the relationship
  between 'l position' and 'p position' across various 'Series' and 'Wavelength' values.
  Annotate only specific data points (like those with unique 'Wavelength') to draw
  attention to key observations. Use highlights (color or size changes) to differentiate
  'Series'. The goal is to make it easy to see trends and identify outliers in the
  interactions between 'l position' and 'p position' within different wavelength ranges.
  Ensure annotations provide context and insights into the data's significance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different ''Series''?

  2. How would you like the specific data points with unique ''Wavelength'' to be
  annotated? (e.g., text labels, arrows, shapes)

  3. Do you prefer a specific size for the highlighted data points?

  4. Should the axes have specific labels or titles beyond the attribute names ''l
  position'' and ''p position''?

  5. Do you want a legend to explain the color coding or size differentiation of ''Series''?

  6. Would you prefer a grid background for the scatter plot, or a plain background?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for the annotations on the data points?

  8. Are there any specific trends or patterns you expect or want to highlight apart
  from identifying outliers?

  9. Would you like to include a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should it
  be?

  10. Are there any additional contextual information or insights you would like to
  include in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Text labels would be great for annotating the specific data points with unique
  ''Wavelength''.

  3. I do not know.

  4. No specific preference beyond the attribute names ''l position'' and ''p position''.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  6. A plain background would be good.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, please title it "Scatter Plot of l position vs. p position".

  10. No, I don''t have any additional contextual information or insights to include.'
