initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the 'Wavelength' on the x-axis and 'p
  position' on the y-axis from the Lyman Series dataset. Add text annotations to highlight
  points for unique 'Wavelengths'. Highlight specific 'Series' using different colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the ''Series''?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles beyond the default
  attribute names?

  4. Are there any axis scaling or limits you would like to specify for ''Wavelength''
  and ''p position''?

  5. Do you prefer the scatter plot to have gridlines, and if so, in what style or
  color?

  6. Would you like to include a legend for different ''Series'' colors?

  7. Are there any additional markers or symbols you prefer for specific data points
  beyond text annotations?

  8. Should there be a specific order or arrangement for the annotations on the scatter
  plot?'
