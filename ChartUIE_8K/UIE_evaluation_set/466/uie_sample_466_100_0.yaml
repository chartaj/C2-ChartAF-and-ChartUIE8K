initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the "Wavelength" vs. "p position"
  from the dataset. Highlight significant wavelengths using different colors and text
  annotations for clarity, especially focusing on the "Lyman Series". Include labels
  and a legend. Since the data pertains to physics, the chart should clearly indicate
  different series and wavelength positions. Use annotations to explain observations
  and patterns. The purpose is to make trends in wavelengths and their positions easily
  understandable. Ensure the chart is visually engaging and highlights the relevant
  physical phenomena effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant wavelengths
  and series?

  2. Are there any specific text annotations or notes you want to include for significant
  wavelengths?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled (e.g., any specific units or notations)?

  4. Do you have any preference for the style of the legend (e.g., its position, format)?

  5. Are there any particular series or data ranges you want to emphasize besides
  the Lyman Series?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style or thickness in the chart?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  8. Are there any patterns or observations you already have in mind that you''d like
  highlighted through annotations?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Wavelength should be in nanometers (nm) and p position should be a unitless index
  or appropriate positioning unit used in the dataset.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Major grid lines would be preferred.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.'
