initial_prompt: Please create a box chart representing the distribution of mobile
  subscriptions over the years for each continent. This data will help visualize the
  spread and central tendency of mobile subscriptions from 1990 onwards. Make sure
  to highlight any outliers and label the continents on the x-axis and the mobile
  subscriptions on the y-axis. The objective is to analyze how mobile technology adoption
  varies across different continents and identify any significant trends or anomalies
  in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the box plots for each continent?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart to enhance readability?

  3. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like the outliers to be marked in a specific way (e.g., with a specific
  symbol or color)?

  6. Should the years be grouped into specific intervals on the x-axis, or be shown
  individually?

  7. Do you want the median line within each box plot to be highlighted in a specific
  color or style?

  8. Would you like any annotations or additional trend lines added to the chart to
  further highlight key findings?'
