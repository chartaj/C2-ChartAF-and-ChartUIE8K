initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between total population
  and mobile subscriptions from 1990 to 1992 in Afghanistan. Use text annotations
  to highlight the total population for each year and provide context with a brief
  description of the data source. Additionally, apply highlights to the 1992 data
  point to emphasize trends over time within the context of mobile subscriptions in
  the early stages of technology adoption in Asia. This will help focus on the growth
  trajectory and the lag in mobile technology adoption during these years.
