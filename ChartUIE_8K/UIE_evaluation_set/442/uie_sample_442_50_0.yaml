initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot with years on the x-axis and GDP per capita
  on the y-axis. Highlight countries in different continents using distinct colors.
  Annotate specific years with missing data points for GDP per capita to emphasize
  gaps.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different continents?

  2. Would you like the x-axis and y-axis to have specific labels or units?

  3. Are there any particular years you want to highlight more than others for missing
  data points?

  4. Do you prefer a title for the scatter plot? If yes, what should it be?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for how the annotations for missing data points should
  appear (e.g., text, symbols)?

  7. Should the data points be displayed as plain dots, or would you like them to
  be represented with different shapes for different continents?

  8. Is there a specific range you would like to set for the x-axis (years) or the
  y-axis (GDP per capita)?

  9. Do you want to display a legend to explain the colors representing different
  continents?

  10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or information on the chart,
  such as average GDP per capita for each continent?'
