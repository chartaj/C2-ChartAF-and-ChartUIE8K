initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various player
  stats (like points, rebounds, assists, net rating, etc.) for NBA players. Highlight
  strong positive and negative correlations. Group by teams (team_abbreviation) to
  show different team patterns. The x and y axes should feature statistical categories
  such as pts, reb, ast, net_rating, etc. Include a color bar to indicate the strength
  of correlations, helping to easily identify high and low values. Make sure the heatmap
  is clear, with labels for each stat category for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., red-blue,
  green-purple)?

  2. What range of correlation values would you like to highlight as strong positive
  or negative correlations?

  3. Should the team labels be displayed prominently on the heatmap, or should they
  be excluded for a cleaner look?

  4. Do you prefer the heatmap to have gridlines separating each cell, or should it
  be seamless?

  5. Would you like to include additional statistical categories beyond pts, reb,
  ast, and net_rating? If so, please specify.

  6. How would you like the strength of the correlations to be represented in the
  color bar (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Should the heatmap include labels for the correlation values within each cell,
  or should it solely rely on color intensity for interpretation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. The team labels should be displayed prominently.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. The heatmap should include labels for the correlation values within each cell.'
