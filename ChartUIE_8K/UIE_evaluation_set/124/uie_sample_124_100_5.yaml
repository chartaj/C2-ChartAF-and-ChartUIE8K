initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the average points (pts),
  rebounds (reb), and assists (ast) per player for each season. Separate the bars
  by season and use different colors for points, rebounds, and assists. This will
  help compare the performance metrics across different seasons and highlight players'
  contributions in these areas. The x-axis should represent the seasons, and the y-axis
  should depict the average values of the metrics. Title the chart appropriately and
  include a legend to differentiate between points, rebounds, and assists.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the colors representing points, rebounds,
  and assists?

  2. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  3. Do you have specific requirements for the font style or size for the title, axis
  labels, or legend?

  4. Is there any particular order in which you would like the seasons to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or data labels on the bars?

  6. Do you prefer any specific style for the gridlines or background of the chart?

  7. Are there any other specific features or design elements you would like to include
  in the chart?'
