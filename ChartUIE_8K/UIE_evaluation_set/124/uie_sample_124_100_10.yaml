initial_prompt: Create a Violin plot to visualize the distribution of player heights
  and weights from the NBA Players dataset. Use 'player_height' on the y-axis and
  'player_weight' on the x-axis, categorized by 'team_abbreviation'. This should help
  us understand the spread and density of player physiques across different teams.
  Make sure to highlight the quartiles and include individual data points for better
  insights. Including color coding for each team would make the plot more insightful
  and aesthetically pleasing. This will provide a comprehensive view of physical attributes
  among players in the league.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used for different
  teams?

  2. Would you like the quartiles to be highlighted with a specific line style or
  color?

  3. How would you prefer the individual data points to be displayed (e.g., dots,
  small circles, transparency levels)?

  4. Should the plot include a legend indicating the colors for each team?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like the chart to include grid lines, and if so, in a specific style?

  7. Is there any specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the plot?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the display order of teams on the x-axis?

  9. Should the chart title include a specific wording or does it need to follow a
  particular style?

  10. Are there any annotations or additional information you would like to be included
  in the plot?'
