initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of NBA players' countries
  from the dataset. Highlight and annotate the largest segments to emphasize the most
  represented countries. Ensure annotations show the country name and the percentage
  it represents. This will help understand the global diversity of NBA players. Use
  distinct colors for each segment for clarity and visual appeal. Consider any missing
  values or unique characteristics in the dataset while preparing the chart. This
  visualization is intended to offer insights into international representation in
  the NBA for sports analysts and fans. Keep it simple yet informative.
