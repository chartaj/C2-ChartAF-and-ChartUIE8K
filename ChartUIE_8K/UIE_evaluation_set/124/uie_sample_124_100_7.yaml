initial_prompt: I need a Box chart to visualize the distribution of players' ages,
  heights, and weights across different teams in the NBA dataset. The X-axis should
  represent the team abbreviations, and the Y-axis should show the values for age,
  height, and weight. Please ensure each team has a separate box for each attribute
  so we can compare the spread of data within and between teams. Additionally, include
  a legend to differentiate between age, height, and weight. Make the chart interactive
  for better data exploration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between age,
  height, and weight in the legend?

  2. Would you like specific labels or titles for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  3. How much detail would you like in the grid lines on the chart (e.g., light, medium,
  heavy)?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for the axis labels, titles, and legend?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the team abbreviations to be
  displayed on the X-axis?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the inclusion of outlier markers in the
  box plots?

  7. Would you like to include any data labels or annotations on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Medium detail in the grid lines would be good.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, I would like to include outlier markers in the box plots.

  7. I am not sure.'
