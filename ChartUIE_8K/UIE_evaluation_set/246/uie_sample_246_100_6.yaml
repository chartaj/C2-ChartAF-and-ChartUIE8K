initial_prompt: I have a dataset on bacteria, detailing their names, families, where
  they are found, and if they are harmful to humans. I'd like a treemap visualization
  to better understand the composition and distribution of these bacteria. Please
  create a treemap where each rectangle represents a bacterial species, categorized
  primarily by their family and colored based on whether they are harmful to humans.
  The size of each rectangle could be uniform since we don't have a frequency measure.
  Additionally, maybe include the "Where Found" information within each cell for better
  context understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  harmful and non-harmful bacteria?

  2. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you prefer for displaying the "Where
  Found" information within each cell?

  3. What level of detail would you like for the labels of each rectangle representing
  bacterial species (e.g., full name, abbreviated name)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout style of the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-and-dice)?

  5. Should the treemap have a legend or key to explain the color coding for harmfulness?

  6. Would you like any additional data annotations or notes to be included within
  the treemap cells?

  7. Is there a particular order or hierarchy in which you want the families to be
  displayed in the treemap?'
