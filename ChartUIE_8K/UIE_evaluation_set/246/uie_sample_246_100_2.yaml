initial_prompt: Create a Spline chart visualizing bacteria data. The x-axis will represent
  the bacteria names, while the y-axis represents harmfulness to humans (Yes, No).
  Highlight harmful (Yes) bacteria in red and non-harmful ones (No) in green. Annotate
  key bacteria like 'Escherichia coli,' 'Staphylococcus aureus,' and 'Lactobacillus
  acidophilus' to focus attention on where they're commonly found (intestinal tract,
  skin, nasal passages, human mouth & intestine). Emphasize the different families
  they belong to with text annotations for better understanding. This helps in biology
  studies to differentiate and recognize bacteria properties easily.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred font style or size for annotations on the chart?

  2. Should the x-axis (bacteria names) be sorted in any particular order?

  3. Do you have a specific color preference for the text annotations indicating the
  families of the bacteria?

  4. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart? If so, do you have any specific
  preferences for it?

  5. Do you want gridlines for the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  6. Would you prefer the spline lines to be smoothed or straight?

  7. Do you have a preferred style or format for the labels (text annotations) of
  the key bacteria?

  8. Should the annotations for the key bacteria include additional information besides
  ''Where Found,'' such as the family name?

  9. Do you have any preference on the background color or theme of the chart (light/dark)?

  10. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle? If yes, do you have any specific
  text in mind?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. No specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include a legend. I have no specific preferences for it.

  5. Both x-axis and y-axis gridlines, please.

  6. Smoothed spline lines.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, include the family name in the annotations.

  9. No specific preference on the background color.

  10. Yes, please include a title and subtitle. Title: "Harmfulness of Common Bacteria
  to Humans", Subtitle: "Highlighted differences in harmful and non-harmful bacteria".'
