initial_prompt: I need a pie chart that shows the distribution of bacteria by their
  harmfulness to humans. The data includes bacterial names, their families, where
  they are found, and whether or not they are harmful to humans. For the pie chart,
  focus on the "Harmful to Humans" column and visualize the proportions of bacteria
  that are harmful (Yes), not harmful (No), and any other categories (if they exist).
  Please make sure the chart is clear and labeled with percentages for each category.
  Use different colors to distinguish between the categories. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for each category ("Yes", "No",
  and any other categories)?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style/size for the labels and percentages on the
  chart?

  3. Should the chart include a legend, or should the categories be labeled directly
  on the pie sections?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the positioning of the percentages on the
  pie chart slices?

  5. Would you like any additional annotations or information displayed on the chart
  (e.g., total number of bacteria analyzed)?

  6. Do you have a particular chart title or subtitle you would like to use?

  7. Do you prefer any specific layout for the chart (e.g., 3D pie chart)?

  8. Are there any brand or style guidelines that should be followed (e.g., specific
  colors or fonts that align with your organization''s branding)?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the font style/size.

  3. The chart should include a legend.

  4. I do not know about positioning preferences for the percentages.

  5. No additional annotations or information is necessary.

  6. I have no specific title or subtitle in mind.

  7. I do not prefer any specific layout, 2D is fine.

  8. I do not have any brand or style guidelines to follow.'
