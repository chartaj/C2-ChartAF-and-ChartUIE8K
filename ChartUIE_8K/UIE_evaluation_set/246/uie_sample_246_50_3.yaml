initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map using the Bacteria Dataset to show regions
  where different bacterial families (e.g. Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae)
  are predominantly found. Highlight areas with harmful bacteria to humans.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind to represent different
  bacterial families and harmful areas?

  2. Should we use a specific geographic region or map projection for the choropleth
  map?

  3. Do you prefer a legend to explain the color coding for different bacterial families
  and harmful levels?

  4. Would you like to include any labels or markers for specific locations on the
  map?

  5. Is there a preferred level of geographic granularity (e.g., country, state/province,
  city) for the map?

  6. Should the intensity of harmful areas be represented with different shades or
  patterns?'
