initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the Bacteria Dataset, showing relationships
  between different bacteria and their characteristics. Use the summary to set up
  the axes: rows for bacteria names and columns for attributes like the family, where
  found, and harmful to humans. Highlight harmful bacteria to make them stand out.
  Add text annotations to some data points, especially those that indicate harmful
  interactions or unique habitats. The aim is to quickly identify patterns and unique
  features in the bacteria data, facilitating easy comparison. This visualization
  will be useful for educational purposes or for quick reference in a biological study.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want a specific color gradient to highlight harmful bacteria?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to appear (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Are there particular bacteria or attributes you want to prioritize in the annotations?

  5. Do you prefer the data points to be displayed with specific shapes or sizes to
  indicate different categories?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend or a key? If so, where would you like it
  positioned?

  7. Would you like additional gridlines or borders to separate the rows and columns
  clearly?

  8. Do you prefer any specific label orientations or text alignments for the bacteria
  names and attributes on the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use a red gradient to highlight harmful bacteria.

  3. I would prefer the text annotations to be in a readable font size and contrasting
  color, perhaps white or black depending on the background color.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend or a key, positioned at the bottom of the heatmap.

  7. Yes, please add additional gridlines to separate the rows and columns clearly.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
