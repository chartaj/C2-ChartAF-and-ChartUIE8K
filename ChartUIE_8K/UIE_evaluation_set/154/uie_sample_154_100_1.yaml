initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the GPA distribution across different
  classes. Highlight extrema to easily compare performance across students. Integrate
  text annotations for gender and race demographics on significant data points, emphasizing
  contrasts. Utilize other numerical subjects like Algebra, Calculus1, Calculus2,
  Statistics, Probability, Measure, and Functional_analysis for additional context.
  This will enable educators to deeply analyze the performance variations among different
  groups and subjects, helping to identify trends and areas needing improvement. Ensure
  the visualization is intuitive and informative, aiding in comprehensive educational
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or theme for the box chart?

  2. How would you like the extrema to be highlighted (e.g., different colors, bold
  lines)?

  3. Do you have preferences for the style and placement of text annotations for gender
  and race demographics?

  4. Should the additional numerical subjects be represented within the same box chart
  or as separate charts?

  5. Would you like any annotations or markers for outliers?

  6. Is there a specific ordering of the classes you prefer on the x-axis?

  7. Do you want grid lines or background shading to make comparisons easier?

  8. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  9. Do you require a legend to explain the meaning of all annotations and highlights?

  10. Should there be any specific title, subtitle, or description added to the chart
  for better context?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Different colors would be good for highlighting extrema.

  3. I am not sure; just make sure the text is easily readable.

  4. Represent them within the same box chart.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, adding grid lines would help.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  10. Include a title like "GPA Distribution Across Different Classes" and a subtitle
  like "Analysis by Gender and Race Demographics."'
