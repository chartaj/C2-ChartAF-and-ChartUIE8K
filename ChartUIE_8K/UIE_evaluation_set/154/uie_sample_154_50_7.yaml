initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of GPAs by gender
  in the dataset. This should help us assess the GPA spread and identify any differences
  between male and female students' performance.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for the violin plots for male\
  \ and female students?\n2. Would you prefer the gender categories to be labeled\
  \ as 'male' and 'female' or do you have other labels in mind?\n3. Is there a particular\
  \ style or theme you would like the chart to follow (e.g. minimalist, professional,\
  \ colorful)?\n4. Do you want the GPA values to be displayed with specific precision\
  \ (e.g. one decimal place, two decimal places)?\n5. Should the chart include a title\
  \ and axis labels, and if so, what text would you like for them?\n6. Do you want\
  \ to include any additional data points or summary statistics (e.g. mean GPA, median\
  \ GPA) on the violin plot?\n7. Would you like the plot to show individual data points\
  \ within the violin shapes as well? \n8. Should we include a legend explaining the\
  \ gender categories if the chart colors are not self-explanatory?\n9. Do you have\
  \ preferences for the chart dimensions or orientation (e.g. vertical or horizontal\
  \ violins)?\n10. Would you like any annotations or highlights on specific GPA ranges\
  \ or important findings?"
