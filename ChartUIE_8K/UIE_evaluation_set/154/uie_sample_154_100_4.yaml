initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the performance of
  students across different subjects. I want to see the distribution of grades for
  each gender ('male' and 'female') within subjects such as Algebra, Calculus1, Calculus2,
  Statistics, Probability, Measure, and Functional_analysis. The x-axis should represent
  subjects and the y-axis should represent the number of students. Each bar should
  be stacked to show the breakdown of grades by gender. This way, I can easily compare
  how male and female students are performing in each subject. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to represent male
  and female students in the chart?

  2. Do you want the chart to display exact numbers of students on the bars, or would
  you prefer only percentages?

  3. Should the grades be grouped into categories (e.g., A, B, C) or shown as individual
  values in the chart?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the subjects to appear on the
  x-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the title or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or data labels on the bars?

  7. Are there any specific font preferences or styles you want for the chart text?

  8. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I prefer exact numbers of students displayed on the bars.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. I would like additional data labels on the bars.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a preference for the legend position.'
