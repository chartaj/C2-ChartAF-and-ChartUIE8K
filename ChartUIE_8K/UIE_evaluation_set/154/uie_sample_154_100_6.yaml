initial_prompt: Could you create a grouped bar chart to visualize the performance
  of students in different subjects? I want the X-axis to represent different subjects
  (Algebra, Calculus1, Calculus2, Statistics, Probability, Measure, Functional_analysis)
  and the Y-axis to show the scores. Each group of bars should represent a different
  class ('A', 'A', 'A'). Also, differentiate the bars by gender ('male', 'female',
  'female') within each class. Use different colors for each gender. This way, we
  can compare male and female performance across subjects within their respective
  classes. The chart should be easy to interpret and visually appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between male
  and female students?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Do you want to include any specific labels for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  4. Would you like to show the exact scores at the top of each bar?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size used in the chart?

  6. Is there any specific order you would like the subjects to be displayed on the
  X-axis?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to identify the colors representing male and
  female students?

  8. Should the bars be displayed with any specific width or spacing between them?

  9. Would you like to add any grid lines to the chart for better readability?

  10. Should the chart include any specific annotations or additional information?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. "Student Performance by Subject and Gender"

  3. X-axis: "Subjects", Y-axis: "Scores"

  4. Yes, please show the exact scores at the top of each bar.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please add grid lines for better readability.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
