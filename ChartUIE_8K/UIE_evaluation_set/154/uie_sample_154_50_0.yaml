initial_prompt: Create a pie chart showing the distribution of students' GPA categories.
  Highlight high GPA students with distinct colors. Add data annotations for top GPA
  scores to emphasize excellence. Utilize "class" to segment the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should there be a specific threshold for what constitutes a "high GPA" to be
  highlighted?

  3. How would you like the GPA categories to be defined (e.g., ranges)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the data annotations?

  5. Should the annotations for top GPA scores include specific details (e.g., student
  names, exact GPA values)?

  6. Would you like any additional legend information or labels to be included?

  7. Are there any specific guidelines on how to segment the data by "class" (e.g.,
  different sections, labels)?

  8. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a preferred title?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, maybe GPAs above 3.5 should be considered high.

  3. I am not sure, perhaps ranges like 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4 could work.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the exact GPA values would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I am not sure, maybe just segment by the academic year (e.g., Freshman, Sophomore,
  Junior, Senior).

  8. Yes, a title like "Distribution of Students'' GPA Categories" would be good.'
