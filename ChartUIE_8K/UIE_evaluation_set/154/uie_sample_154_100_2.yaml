initial_prompt: Let's create a heatmap visualization using the given students' data
  to analyze their academic performance in various subjects like Algebra, Calculus,
  and Statistics. Highlight columns with higher GPAs and annotate specific interesting
  data points to draw attention to key insights, such as gender and race-based performance
  trends. This can help in identifying patterns and areas needing improvement, especially
  focusing on students who excel in multiple subjects versus those who struggle. This
  visualization would be useful for educational administrators to make informed decisions
  on curriculum adjustments and student support strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap focus on a specific range of GPA values?

  3. Do you want to use any particular type of color gradient for highlighting higher
  GPAs?

  4. Are there any particular annotation styles you prefer for highlighting key data
  points?

  5. Would you like to include specific labels or legends for gender and race?

  6. Should any additional contextual information be included in the heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific patterns or trends you would like to emphasize more prominently?

  8. Do you want to use a particular metric or threshold to define ''high'' and ''low''
  performances?

  9. Do you prefer any specific layout or arrangement of subjects in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have any specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, include specific labels or legends for gender and race.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Emphasize patterns related to gender and race-based performance trends.

  8. Yes, use a metric to define ''high'' and ''low'' performances.

  9. I am not sure.'
