initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to analyze the relationships among students' math
  course grades and GPA, with text annotations highlighting outliers and strong correlations.
  Emphasize differences by gender and race.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to have specific color gradients to represent different
  ranges of correlations?

  3. Should the gender and race data be represented with different colors or symbols?

  4. How would you prefer the outliers to be annotated or highlighted on the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferred labels or text annotations for identifying strong correlations?

  6. Would you like to include legends or keys to explain the color coding and symbols
  used on the heatmap?

  7. Are there specific formatting preferences for the text annotations (e.g., font
  size, style)?

  8. Should the heatmap include grid lines between cells, or do you prefer a seamless
  color transition?

  9. Do you have preferences for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal labels)?

  10. Would you like to see summary statistics (e.g., means, medians) for different
  groups (e.g., by gender or race) on the heatmap?

  11. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be grouped or categorized
  on the heatmap (e.g., by course, by overall grade)?'
