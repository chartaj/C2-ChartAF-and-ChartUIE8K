initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the number of participants accessing
  course content, those who audited more than 50%, and those certified. Include all
  courses from the dataset, categorizing by course title. Use the "Participants (Course
  Content Accessed)", "Audited (> 50% Course Content Accessed)", and "Certified" columns
  for the y-axis and "Course Title" for the x-axis. Ensure that each course is color-coded
  distinctly. Title the chart "Participation and Certification in Online Courses from
  Harvard and MIT". Include a legend to differentiate between participants, auditors,
  and certified learners.
