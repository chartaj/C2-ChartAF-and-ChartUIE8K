initial_prompt: Create a line chart that tracks the trends of course participation
  over time for MITx online courses. We need to visualize the "Participants (Course
  Content Accessed)" for courses over the year. Please plot the "Launch Date" on the
  x-axis and "Participants (Course Content Accessed)" on the y-axis. It should highlight
  the changes in participant numbers for different courses from the dataset provided.
  Include markers for the data points to emulate the spikes or drops in participant
  engagement. This will help us assess the popularity and engagement trends of the
  MITx courses over the specified period.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme of the line
  chart?

  2. Would you prefer the x-axis to be displayed with specific date intervals (e.g.,
  monthly, quarterly)?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between different courses?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the chart labels
  and titles?

  6. Should the markers for data points be in a specific shape (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  7. Do you have any specific preference for the thickness of the lines in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations on the chart to highlight
  notable spikes or drops in participation?

  9. Should the chart include a title and, if so, what should the title be?

  10. Do you prefer the chart to have a background color or remain white?'
