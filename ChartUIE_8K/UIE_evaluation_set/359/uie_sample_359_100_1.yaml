initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total number of participants,
  audited, and certified for each course by their Course Title. Use text annotations
  to show the exact values for each segment of the bar. Highlight the courses with
  the highest percentage of certifications for emphasis. This visualization will help
  us quickly compare the engagement and success rates across different courses. The
  purpose is to evaluate the performance and appeal of online courses from Harvard
  and MIT over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for highlighting the courses with
  the highest percentage of certifications?

  2. Is there a specific order you want the courses to be displayed in the chart (e.g.,
  by total number of participants, alphabetically by course title, etc.)?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations showing the
  exact values for each segment?

  4. Should the text annotations be inside or outside the bars, or do you have another
  preferred placement?

  5. Do you prefer grid lines or no grid lines on the chart for ease of reading?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like included for the chart,
  axes, or legend?

  7. Would you like any tooltips or hover effects to display additional information
  when hovering over a bar segment?

  8. Is there a preferred width and height for the chart?'
