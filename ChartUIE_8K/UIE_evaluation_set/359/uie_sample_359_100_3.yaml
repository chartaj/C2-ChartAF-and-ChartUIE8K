initial_prompt: Could you create a table chart summarizing the online courses offered
  by Harvard and MIT? Please highlight key details such as Institution, Course Number,
  Launch Date, Course Title, Instructors, Course Subject, Year, Participants, and
  Certification rates. Additionally, focus on the gender distribution and educational
  background of the participants. This will help us compare course engagement and
  demographics across different subjects. Thank you!

  If so, which one(s)?

  5. How detailed should the instructors'' names be displayed (full names versus last
  names)?

  6. Should the launch dates be formatted in a particular way (e.g., "DD/MM/YYYY"
  or "MM/DD/YYYY")?

  7. Would you like to include any aggregated values or summaries (e.g., averages,
  totals) at the end of the table?

  8. Is there any specific font or size you prefer for the text within the chart?

  9. Do you want the table to include any visual indicators (e.g., icons or bars)
