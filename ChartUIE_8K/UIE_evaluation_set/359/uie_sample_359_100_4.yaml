initial_prompt: Please create a histogram illustrating the distribution of participants
  who accessed course content (Participants (Course Content Accessed)) across different
  course titles. Additionally, include a separate histogram showing the percentage
  of participants auditing more than 50% of the course content (% Audited) for each
  course. The data is from the dataset on online courses from Harvard and MIT, covering
  various subjects. Integrate both histograms into a single chart for comparison.
  Ensure readability and label all axes clearly. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histograms?

  2. Should the histograms use specific bin widths or intervals?

  3. Do you prefer a particular order for the course titles on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by number of participants)?

  4. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the labels and titles?

  5. Should there be any grid lines or background shading in the chart?

  6. Do you want legends for both histograms? If so, do you have any preference for
  their placement?

  chart?

  chart?'
