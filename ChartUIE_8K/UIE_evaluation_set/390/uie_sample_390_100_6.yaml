initial_prompt: I need a grouped column chart to visualize the Company Collaboration
  Network data. Specifically, I want to show how many unique nodes belong to each
  group, and compare this across different groups. Use the columns 'group' and 'id'
  from the data to create this chart. Make sure the chart clearly differentiates between
  the various groups by using distinct colors for each group. This will help us understand
  the distribution of nodes across different business units and identify any potential
  collaboration trends among them. Please ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  between the groups?

  2. What level of detail would you like for the axis labels and legends?

  3. Would you prefer any specific ordering of the groups, such as alphabetical or
  by size?

  4. What title would you like for the chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font size or style for readability?

  6. Should the chart include data labels to show the exact numbers of nodes for each
  group?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the chart to enhance readability?

  8. Is there a specific layout or margin size you need for the chart?'
