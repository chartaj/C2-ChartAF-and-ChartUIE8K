initial_prompt: Create a column chart that illustrates the collaboration network within
  the company. The x-axis should represent different departments, and the y-axis should
  show the number of collaborations. Highlight departments with the highest and lowest
  collaborations. Use text annotations to emphasize key statistics, such as the highest
  collaborating department and the total number of collaborations. This will help
  visualize how different departments interact with each other and focus on areas
  that may need improvement or further analysis. Include colors to distinguish between
  different departments for better visual clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between different
  departments?

  2. Would you like to include any specific text annotations or custom labels for
  key statistics?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations
  and axis labels?

  4. Do you want any specific grid lines or background designs in the chart?

  5. Would you like the bars representing the departments to be of a certain width
  or have specific spacing between them?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding of different departments?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart title and its placement on the chart?

  8. Would you like to display numerical values directly on top of the bars to indicate
  the number of collaborations?

  9. Is there any specific order in which you would like the departments to appear
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by number of collaborations)?

  10. Are there any additional summary statistics or information that you would like
  included in the chart?'
