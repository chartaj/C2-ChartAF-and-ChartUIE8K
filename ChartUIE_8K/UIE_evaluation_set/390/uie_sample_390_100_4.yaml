initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the company collaboration network.
  Each bubble should represent a node from the dataset, where the size of the bubble
  correlates with the 'weight'. Use different colors for the different 'groups' to
  easily distinguish between them. Display 'source' and 'target' connections using
  lines between the bubbles if available. Make sure to label the bubbles with 'name'
  for clear identification. Only show values with no missing data to maintain a clean
  and accurate representation. This will help understand the relationships and central
  figures within the network.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color palette used for different
  ''groups''?

  2. What level of detail would you like for the labels (e.g., full names, initials)?

  3. Do you have a maximum or preferred number of bubbles (nodes) you would like to
  display?

  4. Would you prefer any specific text formatting for the labels (e.g., font size,
  boldness)?

  5. Should the width of the lines representing ''source'' and ''target'' connections
  vary based on any data attribute?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or tooltips in the chart for better clarity?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the bubble size scaling method for ''weight''?

  8. Are there any specific design elements or styles you''d like to incorporate (e.g.,
  background color, grid lines)?

  9. Do you want any additional annotations or highlights to emphasize key nodes or
  connections?

  10. Should the chart maintain a specific aspect ratio or fit into a specific layout?'
