initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the Company Collaboration Network.
  Use 'id' on the x-axis and 'weight' on the y-axis to show the relationships between
  different nodes based on the provided data. Group each point by the 'group' variable
  to distinguish between departments, and color-code them accordingly. Include data
