initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization of the land use in Germany,
  showing real estate and other categories of land use in square kilometers. Highlight
  different types of land such as Housing & Traffic, Agriculture, and Other Land to
  emphasize their relative sizes. Use text annotations to display the exact square
  kilometers for key categories to draw attention to their values. The purpose of
  this visualization is to provide a clear, comparative view of how land is utilized

  urban planning and policy analysis.
