initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing land use in Germany, particularly real
  estate. The sections should include 'Housing & traffic,' 'Other land,' and 'Agriculture'
  with their respective square km sizes. Annotate the chart focusing on 'Housing &
  traffic' and 'Agriculture' by displaying their values prominently. Highlight these
