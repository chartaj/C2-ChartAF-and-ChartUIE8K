initial_prompt: Create a Treemap showcasing the number of volcanoes by country and
  their types. Use "Country" as the primary category and "Type" as subcategories,
  with "Number" to indicate each unique volcano. Highlight elevation using a color
  gradient.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the elevation
  gradient?

  2. Would you prefer a specific way of sorting the countries and types (e.g., alphabetical,
  by number of volcanoes, etc.)?

  3. Is there a particular range of elevation values that should be highlighted or
  emphasized?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout orientation for the Treemap (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical)?

  5. Would you like to include labels for each segment in the Treemap? If so, what
  details should be included (e.g., type name, number of volcanoes, elevation)?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you want to be applied to the text
  in the Treemap?

  7. Should the Treemap include a legend explaining the color gradient for elevation?

  8. Do you have any preference for the border thickness or style around each category
  in the Treemap?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or callouts you would like to include for
  specific countries or types?'
