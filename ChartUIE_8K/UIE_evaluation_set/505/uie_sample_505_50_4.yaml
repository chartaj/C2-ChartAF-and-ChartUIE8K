initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the elevation (Elev) of volcanoes in different
  regions (Region) with latitude (Latitude) and longitude (Longitude) coordinates.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a color gradient to represent elevation values? If so, do you
  have any specific colors in mind?

  3. Should the regions be distinctly labeled on the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range for the latitude and longitude axes?

  5. Would you like to include volcano names or any other specific identifying markers
  on the heatmap?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the elevation gradient?

  7. Is there a specific resolution or grid size you have in mind for the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any specific formatting or styling preferences for the axes (e.g.,
  ticks, labels)?

  9. Would you like to show any specific statistical annotations (e.g., mean elevation,
  max elevation) on the heatmap?

  10. Are there any specific regions you want to highlight or prioritize in the heatmap?'
