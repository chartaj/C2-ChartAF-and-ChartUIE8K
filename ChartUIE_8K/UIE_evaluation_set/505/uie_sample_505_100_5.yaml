initial_prompt: Please provide a geographic heatmap visualizing the distribution of
  volcanoes around the world. Use the 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns to plot the
  locations, color-coded by the 'Volcano Type'. Different colors should represent
  different types of volcanoes such as 'Shield volcano', 'Stratovolcano', etc. Additionally,
  use the 'Elev' column to indicate the elevation of each volcano with varying intensity
  or size on the map. I am interested in both active and historical volcanoes as indicated
  in the 'Status' column. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different volcano types?

  2. How would you like the elevation to be represented? By varying the size of the
  markers or by intensity of color?

  3. Do you want the map to include specific geographical boundaries or labels such
  as country names or regions?

  4. Should active and historical volcanoes be differentiated in any particular way,
  such as by different shapes or opacities of markers?

  5. Would you like to include a legend on the map to explain the color coding and
  size/intensity representation?

  6. Do you prefer a specific map projection or style (e.g., satellite, terrain)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
