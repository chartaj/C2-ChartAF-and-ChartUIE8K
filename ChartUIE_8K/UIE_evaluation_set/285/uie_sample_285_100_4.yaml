initial_prompt: 'Please create a radar chart to visualize key attributes of Parkinson''s
  disease. Use the data from `285.csv`. Plot these variables: `MDVP:Fo(Hz)`, `MDVP:Fhi(Hz)`,
  `MDVP:Jitter(%)`, `MDVP:Shimmer`, `NHR`, and `HNR`. The chart should compare three
  sample records: `phon_R01_S01_1`, `phon_R01_S01_2`, and `phon_R01_S01_3`. Each sample
  should be represented as a separate line in the radar chart to highlight differences.
  This is for a health project on Parkinson''s disease detection.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme for the chart
  lines?

  2. Would you like the radar chart to include markers at each data point for better
  visibility?

  3. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the chart lines?

  4. Should the radar chart include a legend to identify the three sample records?

  5. Would you like the chart to have axis labels for each of the variables?

  6. Should there be a title for the radar chart? If yes, what title would you prefer?

  7. Do you want grid lines to be displayed for better readability of the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for labels and legend
  text?

  9. Should the chart include tooltips or labels displaying the exact values at each
  data point?

  10. Are there any specific aspects of the chart you would like to emphasize or highlight?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, including markers at each data point would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure about the line styles.

  4. Yes, a legend to identify the three sample records would be useful.

  5. Yes, including axis labels for each of the variables would be great.

  6. A title would be nice. How about "Comparison of Key Attributes in Parkinson''s
  Disease Samples"?

  7. Yes, grid lines would help with readability.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for font style and size.

  9. I do not know if tooltips or labels are needed.

  10. I am not sure what specific aspects to emphasize.'
