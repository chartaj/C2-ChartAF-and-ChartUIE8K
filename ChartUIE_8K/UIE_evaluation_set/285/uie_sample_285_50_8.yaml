initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the progression of 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)',
  'MDVP:Fhi(Hz)', and 'MDVP:Flo(Hz)' parameters across different samples for detecting
  Parkinsonâ€™s disease. This will help track frequency variations. Use sample names
  on the x-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent ''MDVP:Fo(Hz)'',
  ''MDVP:Fhi(Hz)'', and ''MDVP:Flo(Hz)'' on the line chart?

  2. Is there a particular line style (solid, dashed, dotted) you prefer for each
  frequency parameter?

  3. Would you like to include markers on the lines to indicate data points?

  4. Should the y-axis be labeled with a specific name or format (e.g., ''Frequency
  (Hz)'')?

  5. Do you prefer a specific range or scaling for the y-axis?

  6. Would you like grid lines enabled on the chart for better readability? If yes,
  should they be on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  7. Should the sample names on the x-axis be rotated or displayed at a certain angle
  for better readability?

  8. Do you want a legend included in the chart to identify each parameter line? If
  so, where should it be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  9. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to add to the chart?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, label it as ''Frequency (Hz)''.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, grid lines on both the x-axis and y-axis would be helpful.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, include a legend. Position it at the right.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
