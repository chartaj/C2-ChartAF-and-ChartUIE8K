initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the Parkinson Disease Detection dataset.
  I want separate histograms for 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'MDVP:Fhi(Hz)', and 'MDVP:Flo(Hz)'
  columns. This will help visualize the frequency distribution of these vocal measurements
  among individuals. Each histogram should be clearly labeled with title and axis
  labels, and preferably use different colors for each histogram to distinguish them.
  This will aid in understanding the spread and central tendency of these features
  in patients with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the bin size or number of bins for
  the histograms?

  2. Would you like the histograms to be displayed side-by-side or in a stacked layout?

  3. Do you have specific colors in mind for each of the histograms?

  4. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like to use for the histograms
  and axes?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the titles, labels, and legends?

  6. Would you like to include any summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, mode) on
  the histograms?

  7. Do you want gridlines on the histograms? If so, any specific preferences for
  their appearance?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
