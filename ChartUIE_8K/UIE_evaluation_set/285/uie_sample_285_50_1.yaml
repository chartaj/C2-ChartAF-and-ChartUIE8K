initial_prompt: Create a dot plot illustrating Parkinson's detection with jitter and
  shimmer values from the dataset. Highlight the points for different statuses. Annotate
  key data points to aid in understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the different
  statuses?

  2. Should the dot plot include a legend to indicate the meaning of each color/status?

  3. How would you like the key data points to be annotated (e.g., labels, callouts)?

  4. Do you have specific jitter and shimmer value ranges you would like to focus
  on?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot for easier readability?

  6. Are there any specific titles or labels you want for the axes and the chart?

  7. Should the points be jittered to prevent overlap, and if so, to what degree?

  8. Do you prefer any specific style for the dots (e.g., shapes like circles or squares)?

  9. Would you like any trend lines or regression lines to be added to the plot?

  10. Should the plot include tooltips that show additional information when a user
  hovers over a point?'
