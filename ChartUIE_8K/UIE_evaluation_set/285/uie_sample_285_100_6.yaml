initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize Parkinson disease detection data.
  I want the plot to show the relationship between 'MDVP:Jitter(%)' and 'HNR'. Each
  point should represent a different case, with 'MDVP:Jitter(%)' on the x-axis and
  'HNR' on the y-axis. Color the points based on the 'status' column to differentiate
  between healthy and Parkinson's cases. Add labels and a legend to make it clear.
  This will help to understand how jitter percentage correlates with the harmonic-to-noise
  ratio in Parkinson's patients versus healthy individuals. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating between
  healthy and Parkinson''s cases?

  2. Would you like any specific markers or symbols for the points representing different
  cases?

  3. Is there a particular size or shape you prefer for the markers?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be for both x-axis and
  y-axis?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for the labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to use a particular type of axis scaling (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Do you prefer specific limits or ranges for the x-axis and y-axis values?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  on the chart?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the title or subtitles of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, grid lines for both x-axis and y-axis would be helpful.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Linear scaling is fine.

  7. I do not have specific limits or ranges.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. A simple title like "Relationship between MDVP:Jitter(%) and HNR in Parkinson''s
  Detection" is good.'
