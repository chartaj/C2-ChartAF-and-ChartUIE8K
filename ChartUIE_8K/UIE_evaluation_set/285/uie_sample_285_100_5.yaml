initial_prompt: Create a bar chart focusing on the comparison of "MDVP:Fo(Hz)", "MDVP:Fhi(Hz)",
  and "MDVP:Flo(Hz)" for Parkinson Disease patients, utilizing the data provided from
  the health dataset. Specifically, I want to see the range and distribution of these
  three frequency measurements across the different samples. Ensure each bar represents
  a specific sample, and the three frequency measurements are displayed side by side
  for easy comparison. This will help visualize the frequency variations in patients.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars representing
  MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Fhi(Hz), and MDVP:Flo(Hz)?

  2. What labeling format would you prefer on the x-axis for the samples (e.g., sample
  names, numbers)?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Should there be a legend explaining the different frequency measurements?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style for axis labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to see error bars to indicate variability in the data?

  7. Should the bars be grouped by sample or stacked for a different visual comparison?

  8. Do you want data values to be displayed directly on the bars?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Sample numbers.

  3. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  4. Yes, there should be a legend explaining the different frequency measurements.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. The bars should be grouped by sample.

  8. I do not know.'
