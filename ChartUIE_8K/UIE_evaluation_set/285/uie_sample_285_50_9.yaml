initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between different features
  in the Parkinson Disease dataset. Highlight high correlations to support health
  analysis effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to represent the strength of the correlations?

  3. Should we use annotations to display the correlation values on the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer a specific ordering or clustering of the features in the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific features you want to highlight or emphasize in the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include a color bar legend to help interpret the correlation
  values?

  7. Would you like to set a threshold to only highlight correlations above or below
  a certain value?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart title or axis labels?

  9. Should the heatmap include grid lines for better readability?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include in
  the heatmap?'
