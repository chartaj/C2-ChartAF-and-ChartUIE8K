initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)'
  values from the Parkinson Disease Detection dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific color preference for the bars of the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  4. Should axis labels be included? If so, do you have specific labels in mind for

  7. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the histogram (e.g., classic,
  modern, minimalistic)?

  8. Should the histogram include a legend or any additional annotations?

  9. Do you prefer the histogram to be displayed with normalized values (probability
  density) or with absolute counts?

  10. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the histogram?'
