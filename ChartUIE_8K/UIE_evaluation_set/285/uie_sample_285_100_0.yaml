initial_prompt: Create a table chart to detect Parkinson's Disease showing key metrics
  like 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'MDVP:Jitter(%)', and 'HNR' for each patient (name). Highlight
  those cells where 'status' is 1. Add text annotations to explain that 'status' 1
  indicates Parkinson's. Summarize unique values and missing data counts for each
  column. This visualization will help health professionals quickly identify abnormal
  voice measurements indicative of Parkinson's.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting cells where
  ''status'' is 1?

  2. Should there be specific symbols or markers used alongside color to highlight
  cells where ''status'' is 1?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the table text?

  4. Would you like the table to include grid lines? If so, any specific styling for
  the grid lines?

  5. Should the key metrics (''MDVP:Fo(Hz)'', ''MDVP:Jitter(%)'', and ''HNR'') be
  located in a specific order within the table?

  6. Do you have a preference for the alignment of numerical data within the cells
  (e.g., left-aligned, right-aligned, centered)?

  7. Would you like to see any specific data sorting order in the table, such as alphabetical
  order by ''name'' or numerical order by one of the key metrics?

  8. Is there a preferred location or style for the text annotations that explain
  ''status'' 1 indicates Parkinson''s?

  9. Do you want the summary of unique values and missing data counts to be included
  within the table, or presented in a separate area?

  10. Do you prefer any additional labels or titles for the table or specific columns
  to enhance clarity?'
