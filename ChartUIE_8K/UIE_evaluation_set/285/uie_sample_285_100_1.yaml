initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize key features for Parkinson Disease
  detection. Use "MDVP:Fo(Hz)", "MDVP:Fhi(Hz)", and "MDVP:Flo(Hz)" on the x-axis and
  "status" on the y-axis to show the distribution. Include annotations for specific
  data points with aberrant values in jitter, shimmer, and HNR to highlight potential
  indicators of disease presence. The purpose is to identify patterns and outliers
  in the vocal measurements that correlate with Parkinson's disease, helping in understanding
  and diagnosing the condition. Highlight significant spread and PPE values using
  different colors or sizes for emphasis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors to use for different
  data points or categories?

  2. Is there a particular style of annotations you prefer for the data points with
  aberrant values in jitter, shimmer, and HNR?

  3. Would you like the data points to be represented in different shapes in addition
  to colors?

  4. Is there a specific range or threshold for what you consider as aberrant values
  in jitter, shimmer, and HNR?

  5. Do you prefer a specific layout or alignment for the x-axis labels ("MDVP:Fo(Hz)",
  "MDVP:Fhi(Hz)", and "MDVP:Flo(Hz)")?

  6. Should the dot plot include any gridlines or background shading for better visualization?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the labels and annotations?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference for colors.

  2. I am not sure, but clear and readable annotations would be helpful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, use your best judgment for identifying aberrant values.

  5. I have no specific preference for the layout of the x-axis labels.

  6. I do not know, but if it helps in visualization, feel free to include gridlines
  or background shading.

  7. I do not have a preference for the font style and size.
