initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization of the complete Kaggle datasets collection
  that highlights the number of unique values for each column category. Use the 'title'
  and 'description' for labeling, and represent each unique value count with hierarchical
  squares. Each square should display the split of unique counts in columns like 'kernels,'
  'discussions,' 'views,' and 'downloads.' Group the squares under categories like
  'views' and 'downloads' to show which ones have the highest variety. Use color codes
  to differentiate between various metrics such as upvotes and featured status, making
  prominent ones more visible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between various
  metrics?

  2. Should the labels for ''title'' and ''description'' be displayed fully or abbreviated?

  3. Do you have a preference for the hierarchical levels or depth in the treemap?

  4. Would you like any specific categories (such as ''views'' and ''downloads'')
  to be emphasized more prominently?

  5. Should the size of the squares represent any additional metric besides unique
  value count?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size of the labels?

  7. How would you like negative or zero values to be handled in the visualization?'
