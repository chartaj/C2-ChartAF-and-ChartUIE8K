  3. Is there a specific geographic region or set of categories you want the choropleth
  map to focus on?

  4. Should the map include a legend to explain the color intensity scale for dataset
  sizes?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the scale or range of color intensity
  to represent file sizes?

  6. Would you like the choropleth map to include any additional annotations or markers
  for specific datasets?'
