initial_prompt: I need a choropleth map that visualizes the number of views for the
  various datasets mentioned. The map should show which regions have the highest and
  lowest number of views. Use the "views" column to color different regions, where
  a darker color represents a higher number of views and lighter color represents
  fewer views. This will help identify geographic trends in dataset popularity. Also,
  include tooltips to display details (like title, views, and owner) when hovering
  over each region. The map should be interactive and visually appealing to aid data
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or theme for the choropleth map?

  2. Are there specific geographic boundaries or regions you would like us to focus
  on?

  3. Should the map include labels for specific regions or cities?

  4. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers, etc.)?

  5. Would you like to include legend customization (such as title and position) on
  the map?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the tooltip text?

  7. Should there be any additional annotations or markers on the map for specific
  regions?'
