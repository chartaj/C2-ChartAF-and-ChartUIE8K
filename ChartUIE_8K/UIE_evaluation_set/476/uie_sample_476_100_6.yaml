initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing cigarette consumption over time for
  different countries. Use the country as the x-axis and the percentage of cigarette
  consumption as the y-axis. Highlight each country's consumption percentage as separate
  bars for each year included in the sample data. Make sure the chart clearly shows
  the missing values and their impact on the overall data representation. Include
  labels for each country and appropriate legends to distinguish between different
  years. The chart title should reflect "Cigarette Consumption Over Time by Country."
  Use colors to differentiate each country's bar.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  countries?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed in a specific order? (e.g., alphabetical,
  by consumption values, etc.)

  3. Do you have any preferences regarding the display of missing values? (e.g., special
  color or pattern)

  4. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and legends?

  5. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend? (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)

  6. Do you require grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, any
  specific styling?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for the y-axis percentage labels? (e.g.,
  one decimal place, two decimal places)

  8. Do you need any additional annotations or markers to highlight specific data
  points or trends within the chart?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios for the chart that you prefer?'
