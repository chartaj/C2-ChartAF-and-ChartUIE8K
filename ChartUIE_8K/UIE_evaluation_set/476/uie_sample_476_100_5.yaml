initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the trend in cigarette consumption
  over time for various countries from 1875 to 1885. Use the columns representing
  different countries (e.g., Austria, Canada, France, etc.) along with the 'country'
  column as the time axis. Ensure to handle missing values appropriately. This visual
  should help in understanding how cigarette consumption has changed in these time
  periods. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for different
  countries in the line chart?

  2. Are there any particular countries you would like to highlight in the line chart?

  3. How would you prefer to handle missing values in the data? (e.g., interpolation,
  omission)

  4. Do you have a preferred style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend indicating which line corresponds to which
  country?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the axes labels and their formats?

  7. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like to use for the chart
  text?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart? If so, should
  they be major gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  9. Do you want to add data markers to the lines (e.g., circles, squares) to indicate
  actual data points?

  10. Is there a chart title you have in mind or any specific subtitle and footnote
  to include?'
