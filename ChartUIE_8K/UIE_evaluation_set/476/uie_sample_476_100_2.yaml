initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize cigarette consumption across different
  countries from 1875 to 1885. Include data columns for countries like Austria, Canada,
  France, Germany, and others. Annotate France to highlight its consistent value of
  0.1. Use text annotations to emphasize specific values. Highlight columns with significant
  data, particularly focusing on non-missing values. Ensure the chart is clear, practical,
  and depicts trends in cigarette consumption over time. Use the data details efficiently
  for meaningful insights on social-science aspects. Make the annotations informative
  and visually engaging.
