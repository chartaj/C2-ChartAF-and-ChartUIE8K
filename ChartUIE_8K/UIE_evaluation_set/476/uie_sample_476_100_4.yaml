initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the cigarette consumption trends
  over the years. The x-axis should represent the years (from the 'country' column),
  and the y-axis should represent the cigarette consumption percentages for each country.
  Each country should have a different color for its data points to easily distinguish
  between them. I am particularly interested in seeing the trends for countries like
  France, Germany, and the UK. Include legends and make sure the plot highlights missing
  data points clearly. The goal is to observe how cigarette consumption has changed
  over time in these countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used for the different
  countries?

  2. Would you like the plot to include trend lines in addition to the scatter points?

  3. Are there specific markers or symbols you prefer to represent missing data points?

  4. What range do you expect your y-axis to cover, or should it be automatically
  adjusted based on the data?

  5. How would you prefer the legends to be displayed (e.g., specific positioning,
  format)?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to add to the chart?

  7. What should be the title of the chart, and do you prefer any specific style for
  it?'
