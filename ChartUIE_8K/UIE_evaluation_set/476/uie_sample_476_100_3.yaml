initial_prompt: I have data on cigarette consumption in various countries over different
  years. I want to visualize this information using a heatmap. The x-axis should represent
  the years, and the y-axis should list the countries. The heatmap should depict the
  level of cigarette consumption, with different colors indicating different consumption
  levels. Ensure to highlight years with missing data if any, to get a clear overview
  of data gaps. Additionally, use a color gradient that makes it easy to distinguish
  between different consumption values, ranging from low to high consumption. Include
  a legend to explain the color scales.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or gradient for indicating different
  levels of cigarette consumption?

  2. How would you like to visually highlight years with missing data?

  3. Is there a specific way you would like the legend to be formatted or positioned?

  4. Do you prefer any specific text formatting or font style for the axes labels
  or the legend?

  5. Would you like to add any specific annotations or notes to the heatmap?

  6. Is there a particular range of years you are most interested in highlighting?

  7. Are there specific countries that you want to emphasize more prominently in the
  heatmap?'
