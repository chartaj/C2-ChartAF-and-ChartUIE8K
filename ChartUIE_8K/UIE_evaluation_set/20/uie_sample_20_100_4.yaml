initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the top 50 artists in the "Best
  Artworks of All Time" from the dataset. The x-axis should represent the number of
  paintings each artist has (column: ''paintings''), while the y-axis should represent
  the years of activity (column: ''years''). Different colors should indicate the
  genres (column: ''genre'') to show how different art movements correlate with the
  number of artworks produced. Additionally, use the artist''s nationality (column:
  ''nationality'') to add markers or labels for better context. This will help in
  understanding the relationship between the quantity of artworks and the historical
  periods across various genres and nationalities.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color palette for the different
  genres?

  2. Should the labels for the artist''s nationality be shown for all points or only
  on hover?

  3. How would you like the years of activity to be represented on the y-axis (e.g.,
  as a range or average year)?

  4. Would you prefer any specific marker shape or style to distinguish different
  nationalities?

  5. Is there a particular font or style you prefer for the axis titles and labels?

  6. Do you want grid lines on the plot, and if so, in what style?

  7. Are there any specific legends or notes you would like to include in the chart?

  8. Should the chart have specific dimensions or aspect ratio?'
