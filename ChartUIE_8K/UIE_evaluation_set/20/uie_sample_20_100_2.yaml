initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of paintings created by
  notable artists. Each bar represents an artist, labeled with their names. Include
  text annotations for the artist's name and the number of paintings at the top of
  each bar to highlight key figures. Use different colors to distinguish between artists,
  emphasizing the diversity in their contributions. Also, provide brief highlights
  on specific artists, such as their genre and nationality. This will emphasize the
  variety in art styles and backgrounds, making the visualization more engaging and
  informative. This chart will help in understanding the prolificacy of each artist.
