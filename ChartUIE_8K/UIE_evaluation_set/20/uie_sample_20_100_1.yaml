initial_prompt: Create a pie chart showing the distribution of artists by nationality
  from the given data. The purpose is to visualize the prevalence of different nationalities
  among the top artists. Include text annotations to display the percentage of each
  nationality slice and use highlights to emphasize the sections with the most and
  least represented nationalities. This will help viewers quickly identify which countries
  have the highest and lowest number of top artists. This visualization is intended
  for an audience interested in the geographic diversity of prominent artists.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to set specific colors for the sections with the most and least
  represented nationalities?

  3. How would you like the percentages to be displayed on the chart (e.g., inside
  the slices, outside with lines)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style for text annotations (e.g., font size, font
  type, color)?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the nationality slices to appear
  (e.g., ascending, descending, alphabetically)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and subtitle?

  7. Should there be a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned on the
  chart?

  8. Are there any additional details or labels you would like to include in the visualization?'
