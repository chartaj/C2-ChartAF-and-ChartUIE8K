initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the number of paintings by the
  nationality of artists. Use the dataset '20.csv' containing information on 50 famous
  artists, their nationalities, and the number of paintings attributed to each. The
  map should highlight countries based on the total number of paintings produced by
  artists from each country, allowing us to see which nationalities contributed most
  to the "Best Artworks of All Time." The color gradient should represent the painting
  count, with darker shades indicating higher numbers. Include a legend for clarity.
  Use data from the 'nationality' and 'paintings' columns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the gradient used in
  the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like any specific countries to be highlighted or distinguished in any
  special way?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the map (e.g., classic, modern,
  artistic)?

  4. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  map?

  5. Do you have a preferred geographical projection for the map?

  6. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles on the map?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the legends and labels?

  8. Do you want any specific information to be displayed when a user hovers over
  a country on the map?

  9. Should the legend have a particular position or layout on the map?

  10. Are there any specific thresholds or ranges for the color gradient that you
  want to set?'
