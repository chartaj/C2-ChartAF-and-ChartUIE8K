initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize coastal population vs. mismanaged
  plastic waste over the years from the dataset. Highlight crucial years and data
  points where mismanaged waste spikes or coastal population declines. Add text annotations
  for significant data points to provide context. This visualization will help emphasize
  the environmental impact and population trends over time. Ensure the chart is clear
  and easy to interpret to facilitate better understanding among viewers. Highlight
  specific countries or regions if they show notable trends or outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  coastal population and mismanaged plastic waste?

  2. Would you like the highlighted crucial years and data points to have distinct
  colors or markers?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations
  on significant data points?

  4. How would you like notable trends or outliers for specific countries or regions
  to be highlighted?

  5. Would you prefer the X-axis (years) to have major and minor ticks or a continuous
  timeline?

  6. Should the Y-axis use a linear or logarithmic scale to better visualize the data?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order in which the bars (coastal population
  and mismanaged plastic waste) are stacked?

  8. Do you want a legend explaining the colors or markers used for highlighting trends
  and data points?

  9. Is there a particular way you''d like to see the data labels formatted (e.g.,
  number of decimal places, units)?

  10. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?
  If so, do you have a preference for their style?'
