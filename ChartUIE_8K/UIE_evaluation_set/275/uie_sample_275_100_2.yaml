initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart showing the trend of Mismanaged Plastic Waste
  (tonnes) over the years. Highlight significant increases with annotations. Use different
  lines for various entities like countries. The chart should illustrate how coastal
  populations correlate with mismanaged plastic waste over time. This visualization
  will help understand environmental impacts and population effects on waste management.
  Include annotations on the chart to emphasize key data points, peaks, and trends.
  Show legends and axis labels for clarity. Ensure missing data values are acknowledged
  in the footnote or chart notes for transparency. Add a title related to environmental
  science impacts.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart? \n2. What\
  \ specific countries or entities would you like to highlight?\n3. Are there specific\
  \ years or events that should be annotated as significant?\n4. Do you have a preferred\
  \ style for the annotations (e.g. text boxes, arrows)?\n5. Would you like specific\
  \ formatting for the legends or axis labels?\n6. Should the trend lines be smoothed\
  \ or should they show actual data points?\n7. Is there a particular font or size\
  \ you prefer for the title and labels?\n8. Do you have any additional preferences\
  \ for how missing data values should be acknowledged in the footnote or chart notes?\n\
  9. Are there any additional elements or features you would like included in the\
  \ chart?"
answers: "<start of user response>\n1. I am not sure.\n2. Highlight the United States,\
  \ China, India, and Brazil.\n3. I am not sure.\n4. I do not have a specific preference.\n\
  5. I do not have a specific preference.\n6. Show actual data points rather than\
  \ smoothed trends.\n7. I do not know.\n8. Ensure that missing data values are noted\
  \ clearly in the footnotes or chart notes.\n9. No additional elements or features\
  \ needed. \n<end of user response>"
