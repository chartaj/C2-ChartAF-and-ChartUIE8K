initial_prompt: I need a choropleth map visualizing the distribution of mismanaged
  plastic waste globally over different years. Use "coastal-population-vs-mismanaged-plastic.csv"
  from environmental science data. Highlight countries based on the amount of mismanaged
  plastic waste in tonnes, with color gradients depicting various levels. Include
  year as a filter to see changes over time. The map should also show coastal population
  density as an overlay. Ensure missing data is appropriately handled. This is for
  analyzing environmental impact and helping target areas for stricter waste management
  policies.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradients used in the choropleth
  map to depict various levels of mismanaged plastic waste?

  2. What color scheme would you like to use for the coastal population density overlay?

  3. How would you prefer the missing data to be handled or represented on the map?

  4. Is there a specific year range you are particularly interested in for the year
  filter?

  5. Do you have any specific design preferences for the map''s legend and labels?

  6. Are there any additional details or annotations you''d like to include on the
  map to provide more context to the viewers?

  7. Would you like to see any specific countries highlighted or detailed more prominently
  on the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer missing data to be represented in a neutral color or pattern,
  such as grey or hashed lines.

  4. I am particularly interested in the period from 2000 to 2020.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have any specific countries in mind, but highlighting countries with
  the highest amounts of mismanaged plastic waste would be helpful.'
