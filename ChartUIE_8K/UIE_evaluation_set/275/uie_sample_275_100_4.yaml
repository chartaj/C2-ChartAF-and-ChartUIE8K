initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the 'coastal-population-vs-mismanaged-plastic.csv'
  dataset. Plot 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Mismanaged plastic waste (tonnes)' on the
  y-axis. Use different colors to represent different 'Entities' (countries). Include
  a trend line to visualize the trend of mismanaged plastic waste over the years.
  The data covers topics within 'environmental-science,' focusing on the impact of
  coastal populations on plastic waste management. Ensure missing data points are
  appropriately handled. Visualize how mismanaged plastic waste has evolved over time
  across different countries. Please label axes and add a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  represent different countries?

  2. Would you like the trend line to be a specific type (e.g., linear, polynomial)?

  3. Are there any specific countries or entities you want to highlight?
