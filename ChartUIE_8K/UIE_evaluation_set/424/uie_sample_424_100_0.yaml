initial_prompt: I want a stacked column chart visualizing the bird counts during Christmas
  in Hamilton, Ontario. The X-axis should represent years, and each column should
  be stacked by species. The Y-axis will show the number of birds counted. Add text
  annotations for notable counts to draw attention and highlights for years with unusual
  trends. The purpose is to observe species population trends over the years and highlight
  critical changes. The chart should help bird conservation efforts by making it easy
  to spot significant variations in bird counts. Add context through headers and titles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked columns by species?

  2. Are there specific species you would like to highlight or differentiate in the
  chart?

  3. How would you like the notable counts annotations to be formatted (e.g., bold,
  different color)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the design of the highlights for years with unusual
  trends (e.g., different background color, bold border)?

  5. Do you want the X-axis labels (years) to be at a specific angle or in a certain
  format?

  6. Would you prefer the Y-axis to have a specific scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Is there any specific title or header style you have in mind (e.g., font size,
  font type)?

  8. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, how dense should they be?

  9. Are there specific points of context or additional information you''d like included
  in the headers or titles?'
