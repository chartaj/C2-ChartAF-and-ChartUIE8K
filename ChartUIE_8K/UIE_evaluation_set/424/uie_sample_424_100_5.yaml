initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the bird counts during Christmas
  time in the Hamilton area of Ontario. Plot "year" on the x-axis and "how_many_counted"
  on the y-axis. Color the points based on the "species" to identify different bird
  species variations over the years. This will help us see trends and changes in bird
  populations over time. Ensure you label the axes appropriately and include a legend
  to differentiate the species. Use a title that reflects the chart's purpose, such
  as "Bird Counts Over the Years During Christmas in Hamilton, Ontario."
questions: '1. Do you have a specific size or aspect ratio preference for the scatter
  plot?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you have any specific color palette or theme preferences for differentiating
  bird species?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the plot for better readability? If so, should they
  be major or minor grid lines?

  6. Would you like to include a trend line to show overall trends in the data?

  7. Are there any specific points or data ranges that you want to highlight or annotate
  on the scatter plot?

  8. Should custom markers be used for different species, or are default shapes acceptable?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the thickness and style of the axis lines and
  grid lines?

  10. Do you want to include any additional text or annotations on the chart?'
