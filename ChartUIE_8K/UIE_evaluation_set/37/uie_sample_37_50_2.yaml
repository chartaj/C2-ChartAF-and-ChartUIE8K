initial_prompt: I’d like a violin plot that visualizes the distribution of the 'Annual
  Income (k$)' across different 'Age' groups. Please annotate some data points for
  specific 'Spending Scores' to highlight varied spending behavior. Use color highlights
  to differentiate age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating age groups?

  2. Are there specific age groups you want to focus on or highlight?

  3. How many data points would you like annotated for ''Spending Scores''?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for the annotations (e.g., labels, markers,
  tooltips)?

  5. Do you want any additional statistical information displayed on the plot (e.g.,
  quartiles, mean)?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the age groups to be displayed?

  7. Would you like a legend to explain the color coding used for age groups?

  8. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  9. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the violin plot?

  10. Would you like any specific grid lines or background styles?'
