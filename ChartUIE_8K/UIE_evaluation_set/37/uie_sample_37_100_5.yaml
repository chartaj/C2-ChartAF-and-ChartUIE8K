initial_prompt: Create a pie chart from the Mall Customer Segmentation Data. Segment
  the chart based on the 'Gender' column to show the proportion of male and female
  customers. Use different colors to distinguish between the categories. The chart
  should provide a clear visual representation of the distribution of genders among
  the customers. Ensure the pie slices are labeled with both the category and the
  percentage. Also, consider adding a legend for additional clarity. This chart will
  help us understand the gender distribution of our customer base in a quick and intuitive
  way.
