initial_prompt: I'd like a scatter plot for Microsoft Stocks. Use the 'Date' for the
  x-axis and 'Close' prices for the y-axis. Could you differentiate the points by
  color for a better visual representation of trends over time? Also, it would be
  great if you can make the plot interactive, allowing me to hover over points to
  see the exact values. Since this data goes back to 1986, it might also help to add
  a zoom in/out function to better navigate through the years. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  the points?

  2. Would you like the points to be differentiated by a specific time period (e.g.,
  decades, specific years)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific axis scale (linear/logarithmic) for either the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  4. Would you like to add any reference lines or markers for significant dates/events?

  5. Is there any specific format or style you prefer for the labels and tooltips
  (e.g., font size, color, etc.)?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations or notes included on the chart?'
