initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the historical price changes of Ethereum
  using data from the provided CSV file. The histogram should show the distribution
  of daily percentage change (% Change) in Ethereum prices over the entire dataset.
  Include appropriate labels for axes and a title reflecting Ethereum’s price volatility.
  Make sure the bins are representative of the data spread and consider the frequency
  of changes. It would help to visually identify how often certain percentage changes
  have occurred. Provide legends if necessary for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the number of bins in the
  histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels (font size, style, etc.)?

  4. Should the histogram include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Would you like to see any particular summary statistics (mean, median, etc.)
  overlaid on the histogram?

  6. Do you prefer a specific title for the histogram, or should it be generated based
  on Ethereum’s price volatility?

  7. Would you prefer ticks on the x-axis to represent each bin interval?

  8. Are there specific ranges of percentage changes (% Change) that should be highlighted
  in the histogram?

  9. Is there a preferred format for the legend, or would you like it omitted if it''s
  not necessary?

  10. Do you have any specific formatting requirements or styles for the data labels
  on the histogram?'
