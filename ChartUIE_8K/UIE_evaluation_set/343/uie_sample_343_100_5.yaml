initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart using the provided Ethereum historical
  data from the file '../Extra_datas/data/343.csv'. The x-axis should represent the
  'Date', the y-axis should indicate the 'Price', and the bubble size should correspond

  when hovered over. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles based on
  the ''Change %'' values?

  entire dataset?

  3. Do you prefer any particular scale (linear or logarithmic) for the y-axis representing
  ''Price''?

  4. Should the size of the bubbles representing ''Vol.'' be scaled in a specific
  way?

  5. Do you have a preference for how the ''Price'' values are formatted (e.g., currency
  format)?

  6. Do you want gridlines or reference lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like to highlight any specific data points or trends on the chart?

  8. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?
