initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Ethereum cryptocurrency historical performance
  using a candlestick chart. The chart should display the Date on the x-axis and the
  Price, Open, High, and Low values on the y-axis. Each candlestick should represent
  a single day, showing the opening price as a rectangular box, the closing price
  as the top or bottom of the box, and the high and low prices as wicks extending
  from the box. Ensure that changes in volume are also represented in the chart. Use
  color coding to indicate days with price increases and decreases.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for indicating days with
  price increases and decreases?

  2. Would you like the volume changes to be displayed as a separate bar graph below
  the candlestick chart or integrated into the candlestick bars?

  3. Do you have a preferred time range for visualization (e.g., last month, last
  year)?

  4. Should the x-axis display every single date, or would you prefer periodic labels
  (e.g., weekly or monthly intervals)?

  5. How would you like to handle the volume labels (e.g., in millions, abbreviated
  as ''M'')?

  6. Do you have a preference for how the y-axis should be labeled (e.g., specific
  intervals, log scale)?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on specific dates/events that
  may have impacted prices?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall theme of the chart (e.g., dark mode,
  light mode)?'
