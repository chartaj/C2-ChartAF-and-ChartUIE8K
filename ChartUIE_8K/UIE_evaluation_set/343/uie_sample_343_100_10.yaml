initial_prompt: I have some historical data on Ethereum cryptocurrency, including
  various metrics like Date, Price, Open, High, Low, Volume, and Change %. I would
  like a heatmap that visualizes this data to help me quickly understand the patterns
  and correlations. The heatmap should highlight the relative increases and decreases
  in these values over time, perhaps using color gradients to show higher vs. lower
  values. This is to help me see trends or anomalies, such as periods of high volatility
  or price spikes. Please make sure the heatmap is clear and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme or gradient used to represent
  higher vs. lower values on the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or labels on significant dates or events?

  3. Should the heatmap display any particular metrics more prominently than others,
  such as ''Price'' or ''Volume''?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of time the heatmap should cover, such
  as weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals?

  5. Would you like the axes and legends to include additional information or notes
  for better clarity?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds or benchmarks that you''d like highlighted
  on the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines or separators between time periods for better
  readability?

  8. Would you prefer the heatmap to be more detailed with finer granularity, or more
  high-level with broader time segments?

  9. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the heatmap, such as horizontal
  vs. vertical layout?'
