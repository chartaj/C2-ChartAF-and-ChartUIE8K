initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize the data on the proportion of high-tech
  and medium industry over the years from 1990 to 2015. Highlight the years with the
  highest and lowest proportions to show trends. Please include annotations for these
  key points to focus attention on significant changes. The goal is to understand
  the overall trend and identify any notable peaks or declines in the industry proportion
  over this period. This will be useful to analyze the growth and decline in the high-tech
  and medium industry sectors.

  lowest proportions?
