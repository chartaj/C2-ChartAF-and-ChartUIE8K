initial_prompt: Create a column chart showing the proportion of high-tech and medium
  industry over the years. Highlight notable years and add annotations to emphasize

  boxes, arrows, or call-out bubbles?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and sub-title? If so, what would you
  like them to be?

  8. Would you like to show data labels on top of the columns to indicate the exact
  proportions?

  9. Is there a specific way you want the axes to be formatted, such as starting from
