initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map that visualizes the global distribution of
  blood types using the given data. Highlight each country's proportion of different
  blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-). Ensure population size is represented.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different blood
  types on the map?

  2. Should population size be represented using varying shades of a single color,
  or would you prefer another method?

  3. Do you want labels or tooltips to show exact proportions and population size
  when hovering over a country?

  4. Would you prefer to highlight any specific countries or regions?

  5. Are there any particular thresholds for blood type proportions that you want
  to emphasize with distinct colors?

  6. Should the choropleth map include a legend to explain the color coding for blood
  types and population size?

  7. Do you require separate maps for each blood type, or a single combined map?

  8. Is there a specific map projection that you prefer for this global map visualization?'
