initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the global blood type distribution
  from the given data. Highlight various blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-,
  AB-) across different countries (e.g., Albania, Algeria, Argentina). Use text annotations
  to display the exact percentages on top of each bar. The chart should help to easily
  compare the prevalence of each blood type in the population of each country. Additionally,
  emphasize blood type distribution differences among countries to understand regional
  variances. The main purpose is health-relatedâ€”to inform global health initiatives
  and blood donation strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  blood types?

  2. Would you prefer a specific layout for the bar chart (e.g., grouped bars, stacked
  bars)?

  3. Should the chart have a legend explaining the colors corresponding to each blood
  type?

  4. Do you want gridlines in the background to enhance readability?

  5. Should the countries be listed on the x-axis in any specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on population size, based on a specific blood type prevalence)?

  6. Is there a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  7. Do you have a specific title or subtitle in mind for the bar chart?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific country or blood type in the chart (e.g.,
  by using a different color or a thicker border)?

  9. Should the y-axis display percentages, counts, or a specific range?

  10. Do you want any particular formatting for the annotations displaying the exact
  percentages?'
