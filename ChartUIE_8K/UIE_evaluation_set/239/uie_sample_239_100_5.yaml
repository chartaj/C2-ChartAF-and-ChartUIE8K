initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the global distribution of
  blood types from the given dataset. The x-axis should represent the different countries,
  and the y-axis should show the percentage of each blood type (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-,
  A-, B-, AB-). Use different colored lines for each blood type and label them clearly.
  Include the population as a secondary line for context. Make sure to handle any
  missing values appropriately. The chart should help understand the variation in
  blood type distribution across countries. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the blood type lines?

  2. How would you like the population line to be styled (e.g., dashed, dotted, different
  color)?

  3. Would you like any specific markers on the lines to distinguish data points (e.g.,
  circles, squares)?

  4. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a preference for the title
  text?

  5. Do you want to include a legend? If yes, where should it be placed (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  6. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight?

  7. What method would you prefer for handling missing values (e.g., interpolation,
  omission)?

  8. Would you like grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be for both x and
  y axes?

  9. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for labels and titles?

  10. Should there be any annotations or notes added to the chart for context?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a dashed line.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, the title could be "Global Distribution of Blood Types".

  5. Yes, please include a legend. I do not know where it should be placed.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure, maybe interpolation.

  8. Yes, grid lines on both x and y axes would be great.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.


  Thank you!'
