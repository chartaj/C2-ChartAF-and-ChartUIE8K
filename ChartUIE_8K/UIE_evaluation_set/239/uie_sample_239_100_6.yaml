initial_prompt: Create a Treemap chart to visualize the global blood type distribution
  data. The chart should display different countries based on the proportion of each
  blood type (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-). Each rectangle will represent a country,
  and its size will depict the country's population. The color coding inside each
  rectangle should indicate the percentages of different blood types within that country.
  This visualization will help us easily compare and understand the distribution of
  blood types globally. Label each section clearly with the country's name and corresponding
  blood type percentages.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preference for the blood type
  proportions?

  2. Which font style and size would you prefer for the labels on the chart?

  3. How would you like the legend to be displayed (e.g., position, format)?

  4. Should the countries be ordered or grouped in a specific way, such as by continent
  or population size?

  5. Do you prefer any specific layout or hierarchy for the Treemap (e.g., nested,
  squarified)?

  6. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or differentiate in the
  visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color palette preference for the blood
  type proportions.

  2. I do not know the preferred font style and size for the labels.

  3. I prefer the legend to be displayed at the bottom, in a horizontal format.

  4. I am not sure about ordering or grouping the countries; do it in a way that best
  represents the data.

  5. I have no specific preference for the layout or hierarchy of the Treemap.

  6. I do not have any specific countries to highlight or differentiate.'
