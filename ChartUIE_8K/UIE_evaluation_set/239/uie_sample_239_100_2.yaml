initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot that visualizes the Global Blood Type Distribution
  per country. Plot each blood type percentage (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-)
  on the y-axis, and different countries on the x-axis. Make sure to highlight the
  countries with the highest and lowest percentages for each blood type. Include text
  annotations to display the exact percentages for these highlighted points. This
  will help viewers easily identify blood type distribution differences across countries,
  emphasizing global health data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Should the highlighted countries with the highest and lowest percentages have
  specific marker shapes or sizes?

  3. Do you want a particular font style or size for the text annotations displaying
  the exact percentages?

  4. Should the x-axis (countries) be sorted in alphabetical order or by another criterion?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific tooltips or labels for the data points when hovering
  over them?

  7. Should the scatter plot include a legend to indicate the blood types?

  8. Would you like to display the plot title and axis labels in a specific format
  or style?

  9. Do you have any preferences on the margin or spacing around the scatter plot?

  10. Would you like to add any additional descriptive captions or annotations to
  the chart?'
