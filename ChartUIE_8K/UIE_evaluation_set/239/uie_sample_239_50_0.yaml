initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing Global Blood Type Distribution
  using the provided dataset. Highlight countries with unique blood type distributions.

  different color, pattern, etc.)

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations on countries
  with the highest O+ and A+ blood types?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend for blood type colors/patterns?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of values? If yes, should
  they be horizontal, vertical, or both?
