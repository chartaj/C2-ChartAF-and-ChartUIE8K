initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showcasing the blood type distribution
  across various countries. The x-axis should represent countries, while the y-axis
  shows the percentage of each blood type. Annotate data points for the top three
  countries with the highest percentages of O+ and A+ blood types to highlight key
  differences. Use color highlights for each blood group to distinguish them clearly.
  Ensure all blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-) are included in the chart
  for comprehensive comparison. This visualization will help in understanding global
  blood type variations.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the different blood
  groups?

  2. Would you like the countries to be alphabetically ordered or sorted by a specific
  blood type percentage?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the annotations?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the background of the chart?

  5. Do you need a legend to identify each blood group, and if so, where should it
  be placed (top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. What level of detail do you prefer for the data point annotations (e.g., percentage
  value, country name)?

  7. Should the chart include a title and subtitles, and if so, do you have any specific
  text in mind for them?

  8. Do you prefer any specific styles or formats for the axes labels?'
