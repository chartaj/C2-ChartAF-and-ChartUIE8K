initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the trends in various product spending
  over time for different regions and channels from the Wholesale Customers Data.
  Specifically, I want to see how the spending on Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper,
  and Delicassen evolves, with separate lines for each category. I want the X-axis
  to represent the time (or an index to denote sequence if time isn't available) and
  the Y-axis to show the spending amounts. This will help me understand consumption
  patterns and identify seasonal trends for each product category across different
  regions and sales channels.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the lines representing
  different product categories?

  2. Should the lines for different regions or channels be differentiated by color,
  line style, or both?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the product categories in the legend?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you want any specific annotations or markers to indicate important data points
  or trends?

  6. Should the chart include a title and labels for the X and Y axes? If so, do you
  have any specific preferences for these labels?

  7. Do you want to display the data points along the lines, or should the lines be
  smooth continuous curves?

  8. Are there any particular intervals you would like on the X-axis (e.g., monthly,
  quarterly)?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  10. Would you like to include a secondary Y-axis for additional data comparison?

  11. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?

  12. Do you want to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?'
