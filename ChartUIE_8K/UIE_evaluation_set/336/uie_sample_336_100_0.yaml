initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Wholesale Customers Data focusing
  on the columns Channel, Region, Fresh, Milk, Grocery, Frozen, Detergents_Paper,
  and Delicassen. Use annotations to highlight notable values, especially in the Fresh
  and Milk categories, to draw attention to high or low figures. The heatmap should
  help identify patterns or correlations in purchasing behaviors across different
  regions and channels. Highlight data points with extreme values to make them stand
  out visually. The aim is to assist business decisions in understanding customer
  purchasing trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific color gradient to represent high and low values?

  3. How would you like the annotations to appear (e.g., size, font, color)?

  4. Should extreme values be highlighted with a specific color or visual marker?

  5. Do you prefer any particular layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. How would you like the data to be normalized or scaled?

  7. Is there a specific range of values you would like to emphasize more in the Fresh
  and Milk categories?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the inclusion of labels or legends?

  9. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap for better cross-referencing?

  10. Should the heatmap include tooltips or hover information for more detailed insights?

  11. Are there any specific regions or channels that you want to prioritize in the
  visualization?

  12. Would you like the data points to be clustered in any specific way, such as
  by region or channel?'
