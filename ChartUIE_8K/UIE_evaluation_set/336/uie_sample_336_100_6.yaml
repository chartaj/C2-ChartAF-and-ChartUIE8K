initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the 'Milk' and 'Grocery' spending
  patterns separated by 'Channel' and 'Region' from the Wholesale Customers Data.
  This will help understand the distribution and variability in spending across different
  channels and regions within the business. The chart should clearly show the quartiles,
  median, and any potential outliers for these two categories. Can you create this
  box chart for me?
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between "Channel"
  and "Region"?

  2. Would you like the box plots for "Milk" and "Grocery" to be displayed side by
  side or stacked?

  3. Do you prefer to include any specific annotations (e.g., mean values, additional
  statistics) on the box chart?

  4. Should the chart have grid lines for easier reading, or do you prefer a cleaner
  look without them?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the "Channel" or "Region" categories
  to be displayed?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or labels to clearly indicate which box plots
  correspond to which categories?

  7. Do you have a preference for the width of the boxes or the spacing between them?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific titles or labels?

  9. Is it important for you to display the outliers as individual points or use a
  different method?

  10. Are there any additional visual elements you want to include, such as reference
  lines for benchmarks or specific thresholds?'
