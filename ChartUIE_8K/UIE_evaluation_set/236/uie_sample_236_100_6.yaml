initial_prompt: Can you please create a bar chart showing the popularity of songs
  by different artists over the years? Use the 'artist', 'song', 'year', and 'popularity'
  columns to display this data. For the x-axis, please list the years, and for the
  y-axis, use the popularity score. Each bar should represent a different artist,
  and the bars should be grouped by year. This will help visualize which artists and
  songs were most popular in specific years. I'd appreciate if you also differentiate
  between the artists using different colors for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating between
  the artists?

  2. Would you like the bars to have specific labels or annotations for the popularity
  scores?

  3. How do you prefer the legend to be displayed: horizontally or vertically aligned?

  4. Is there a specific order you want the artists or years to be sorted in?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size for axis labels
  and titles?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be for
  both axes or only one?

  7. Would you prefer any specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, classic)?

  8. Are there any specific margins or padding around the chart you would like to
  set?

  9. Should the chart include any tooltips or detailed information on hover for each
  bar?

  10. Would you like to include a subtitle or additional notes on the chart for context?'
