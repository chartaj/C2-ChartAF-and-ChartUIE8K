initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of song popularity,
  danceability, and energy across different years and genres. Highlight the outliers
  in each category to emphasize unusually high or low values. Use text annotations
  to mark these outliers, noting the artist and song for context. The chart should
  help us understand trends in music attributes over time and by genre. Highlight
  genres like 'pop' and 'rock' where variation might be more prominent. This visualization
  will aid in identifying key trends and outliers in popular music attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different genres?

  2. Should the outliers be highlighted in a specific color or style?

  3. Do you prefer labels or tooltips for the text annotations of outliers?

  4. Is there a particular way you want the years to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g.,
  grouped, spaced evenly)?

  5. Would you like to standardize the scales for popularity, danceability, and energy,
  or keep them independent?

  6. Should the visualization include a legend or any other specific elements for
  better interpretability?

  7. How detailed do you want the genre breakdown to be for genres like ''pop'' and
  ''rock'' (e.g., subgenres)?

  8. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations
  and labels?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer labels for the text annotations of outliers.

  4. Spaced evenly would be good.

  5. Keep them independent.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
