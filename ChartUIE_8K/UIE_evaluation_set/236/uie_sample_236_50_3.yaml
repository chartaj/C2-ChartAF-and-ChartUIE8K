initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between popularity, danceability,
  energy, loudness, and valence of songs in the Spotify dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include numerical values within the cells indicating the strength
  of correlations?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels on both axes for all the attributes?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range or scale (e.g., -1 to 1) to be highlighted on
  the heatmap?

  5. How would you like the correlation strength to be visually represented (e.g.,
  gradient color intensity)?

  6. Should we use any clustering or hierarchical grouping in the heatmap?

  7. Do you want a title or subtitle for the heatmap? If so, what should they be?'
