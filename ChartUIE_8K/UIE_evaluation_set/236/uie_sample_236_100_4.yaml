initial_prompt: I want an area chart visualizing the evolution of pop music popularity
  over the years. Use data from the `popularity`, `year`, and `genre` columns, specifically
  focusing on the pop genre from the dataset. Show how pop music has trended in popularity
  from 1999-2000. The area chart should highlight changes year-over-year. Maybe you
  could color different regions to represent varying levels of popularity. Finally,
  make sure the chart is easy to read and understand for those not familiar with data
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different regions representing
  varying levels of popularity?

  2. Would you like to display the exact values of popularity on the chart, or just
  focus on the trend?

  3. Should the x-axis labels (representing years) be formatted in a specific way?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the chart labels and titles
  to ensure readability?

  5. Would you like to add a legend to explain the color-coded regions of popularity
  levels?

  6. Is there a particular title or subtitle you would like at the top of the chart?

  7. Should the chart have gridlines to aid in reading the values, or should it be
  more minimalist in design?

  8. How detailed do you want the y-axis (popularity) to be in terms of numeric intervals?'
