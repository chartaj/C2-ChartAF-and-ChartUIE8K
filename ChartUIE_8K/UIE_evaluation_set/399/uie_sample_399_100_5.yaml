initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart visualizing the price distribution of corn over
  time. This data spans from 2013-04-28 to 2013-04-30, with prices recorded daily.
  The chart should use the 'price' column from the dataset to show the variability
  in corn prices, highlighting any outliers and the overall price range. Please ensure
  the x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis represents the price values. This
  visualization will help us understand the historical price trends and identify any
  unusual price fluctuations in the agriculture and farming sector for corn.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include a title and labels for the axes? If so, what should
  they be?

  3. Should any specific dates or price ranges be highlighted on the chart?

  4. Do you want to include any grid lines for better readability?

  5. Would you like to display numerical values for the quartiles, median, and outliers
  on the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend or any additional descriptive text?

  7. Are there any other specific visual elements or annotations you would like to
  add to the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, please include a title "Corn Price Distribution Over Time" and labels "Date"
  for the x-axis and "Price" for the y-axis.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.
