initial_prompt: I have a dataset of CO2 emissions by country from 2000 and 2020. Specifically,
  it includes data for Japan, Australia, and China within the East Asia & Pacific
  group. I need a line chart that illustrates the change in CO2 emissions over these
  two decades for these three countries. The X-axis should represent the years (2000
  and 2020), and the Y-axis should display CO2 emissions values. Each country should
  have a separate line so their emission trends are clearly distinguishable. Can you
  create this visualization for me?
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each country''s line?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for easier reading of values?

  3. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  country?

  4. Would you like to include data labels at each data point on the lines?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font and size of the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included to identify each country, and if so, where
  would you prefer it to be positioned?

  7. Do you want to include markers (e.g., circles, squares) at each data point on
  the lines?

  8. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add to particular
  points on the chart?

  9. Is there a particular format for the Y-axis values (e.g., scientific notation,
  decimal places)?

  10. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please
  specify the text.'
