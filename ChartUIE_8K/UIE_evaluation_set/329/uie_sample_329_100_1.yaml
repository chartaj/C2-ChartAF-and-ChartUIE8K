initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the SMOC2 raw counts across different
  samples in the context of fibrosis and normal conditions. The dataset includes various
  samples labeled as smoc2_fibrosis1, smoc2_fibrosis2, up to smoc2_normal4. For annotations,
  highlight the highest and lowest values in each sample for easy comparison. This
  will help emphasize critical differences in SMOC2 expressions between fibrotic and
  normal tissues. Please ensure the chart is clear and makes it easy to discern trends
  and anomalies across the samples.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the lines representing fibrotic
  and normal conditions?

  2. Which title would you like for the chart?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  4. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If so, any specific preferences for
  its placement?

  5. Should the axes be labeled with any specific descriptions?

  6. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  7. Are there any specific markers you want to use for the highest and lowest values
  in each sample?

  8. Would you like the chart background to be a specific color or kept as default
  (white)?

  9. Are there any additional data points or ranges you want specifically highlighted
  or annotated on the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style (e.g., dashed, solid)
  for different conditions?'
answers: '1. I prefer colors that distinctly differentiate between fibrotic (maybe
  red) and normal (maybe blue) conditions.

  2. "SMOC2 Raw Counts across Fibrotic and Normal Samples"

  3. I am not sure about specific font styles or sizes.

  4. Yes, I would like a legend included. I do not have a specific preference for
  its placement.

  5. The axes should be labeled "Samples" for the x-axis and "SMOC2 Raw Counts" for
  the y-axis.

  6. Yes, I would like gridlines. Major gridlines should be fine.

  7. I am not sure about specific markers, but it should be clear which points are
  the highest and lowest.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the background color, default white is
  fine.

  9. No, there are no additional specific data points or ranges I want highlighted
  beyond the highest and lowest values.

  10. I do not have specific preferences for line styles; solid lines for both would
  be okay.'
