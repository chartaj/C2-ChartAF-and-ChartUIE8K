initial_prompt: I have raw counts data for fibrosis and normal conditions from multiple
  samples. Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the SMOC2 expression levels
  for each condition (fibrosis and normal) across all given samples. Use different
  colors to differentiate between fibrosis and normal for easy comparison. Label the
  samples on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. Title the chart "SMOC2 Expression
  in Fibrosis vs. Normal Samples." Ensure each bar represents a specific sample count
  distinctly in grouped format. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  fibrosis and normal conditions?

  2. Is there a specific font or style you would like for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability
  of values?

  4. Are there any specific sample groups you would like to highlight or annotate
  within the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any particular order for the samples on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by expression levels)?

  6. Should we include any specific legend placement (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)
  or customization?

  7. Is there a particular width for the bars you would prefer for better visualization?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?'
