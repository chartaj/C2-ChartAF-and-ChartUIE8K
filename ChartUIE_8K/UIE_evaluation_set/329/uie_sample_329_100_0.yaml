initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot displaying the raw counts of SMOC2 in different
  conditions (fibrosis and normal). Use data-driven text annotations to highlight
  specific points with their exact values for better clarity. Use highlights to differentiate
  between fibrosis and normal conditions by varying colors. This visualization will
  help in comparing SMOC2 expression levels effectively across the different samples,
  emphasizing notable differences. The purpose is to analyze and visually interpret
  the variation of SMOC2 in fibrosis versus normal states, which can provide insights
  into its role in these conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between fibrosis
  and normal conditions?

  2. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size or style of the data-driven text annotations?

  4. Is there a specific format you prefer for highlighting and annotating specific
  points with their exact values?

  5. Do you want a legend included to explain the color coding and other highlights?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for better readability?

  7. Do you have any particular font preferences for the text annotations and labels?

  8. Is there a specific range or limit you want to set for the axes?

  9. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers in the scatter plot?

  10. Are there any specific points you want to be highlighted other than those with
  extreme values?

  11. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or style of the scatter plot?'
