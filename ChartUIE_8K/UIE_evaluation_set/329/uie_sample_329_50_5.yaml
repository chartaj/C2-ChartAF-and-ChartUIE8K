initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualization using the provided fibrosis
  SMOC2 raw counts data. The heatmap should display all given categories (fibrosis
  and normal) with gene identifiers on the x-axis and their respective counts on the
  y-axis. Highlight high and low expression levels clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for highlighting
  high and low expression levels?

  2. Would you prefer any particular gradient for the heatmap (e.g., mono-color, bi-color)?

  3. How would you like to handle the labeling of the gene identifiers on the x-axis?
  (e.g., rotated, abbreviated)

  4. Do you have a preferred minimum and maximum value range for the heatmap scale?

  5. Should the heatmap include a color legend for easier interpretation of expression
  levels?

  6. Do you prefer gridlines to be displayed on the heatmap for better separation
  of categories?

  7. Are there any specific values or thresholds you want to highlight distinctly?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the heatmap should include a color legend for easier interpretation of expression
  levels.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
