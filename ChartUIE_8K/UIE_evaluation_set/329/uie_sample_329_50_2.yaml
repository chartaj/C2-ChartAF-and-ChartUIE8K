initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of raw counts for
  SMOC2 across different conditions of fibrosis and normal samples. Highlight segments
  for "smoc2_fibrosis1" and "smoc2_normal3" for emphasis. Include annotations for
  key data points to focus on specific differences.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Do you want the highlighted segments to have a specific color or pattern?

  3. Should the annotations be displayed inside or outside the pie chart slices?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you want for the annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend in the pie chart?

  6. How would you prefer the highlighted segments to be emphasized (e.g., exploded
  slices, bold colors)?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title and labels?

  8. Are there any additional data points you would like to annotate besides "smoc2_fibrosis1"
  and "smoc2_normal3"?

  9. Should the chart include a background grid or border?'
