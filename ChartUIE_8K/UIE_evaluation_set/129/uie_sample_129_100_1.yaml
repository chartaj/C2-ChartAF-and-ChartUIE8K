initial_prompt: Please provide a histogram displaying the Total Cases of Covid-19
  across various State/UTs in India, as indicated in the dataset. Use text annotations
  to emphasize the states with the highest and lowest total cases. Highlight the bars
  representing these states for visual emphasis. The purpose is to quickly show the
  distribution and identify the most and least affected areas. Include the population
  for context.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the histogram, especially
  for highlighting the most and least affected states?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the histogram for better readability?

  3. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you want the histogram to have a title and axis labels? If so, any preferred
  wording?

  5. Should the population context be displayed as a tooltip, legend, or included
  in the bar labels?

  6. Do you prefer the bars to be vertical or horizontal in the histogram?

  7. Is there any specific order in which you want the states to be organized in the
  histogram (e.g., alphabetical, by total cases, etc.)?

  8. Would you like to include additional markers or lines to indicate average or
  median total cases?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for readability.

  3. I am not sure about the font style and size.

  4. Yes, a title and axis labels would be good. You can use "Covid-19 Total Cases
  by State/UT in India" for the title, "States/UTs" for the x-axis, and "Total Cases"
  for the y-axis.

  5. Include the population context in the bar labels.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. By total cases, please.

  8. I do not know.'
