initial_prompt: I have a dataset with the latest Covid-19 India Statewise Data. I
  want to visualize this data using a stacked bar chart. The chart should display
  each State/UT on the x-axis and the y-axis should represent the number of cases,
  segmented into Active, Discharged, and Death cases. Additionally, use different
  colors to clearly distinguish between Active, Discharged, and Death segments in
  each bar. Make sure to label the bars with relevant metrics and percentages for
  clarity. Include a legend and appropriate axis titles. This visualization will help
  in comparing Covid-19 impact across different States/UTs.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to distinguish between
  Active, Discharged, and Death segments?

  2. Would you like to include data labels inside the bars, outside the bars, or both?

  3. Do you have any specific font size or style preferences for the labels and axis
  titles?

  4. Should the legend be placed inside the chart area or outside, and on which side
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, do you have a
  preference for their style (solid, dashed) or color?

  6. Do you prefer the x-axis labels (State/UTs) to be horizontal, vertical, or angled?

  7. Are there any specific States/UTs you want to highlight or emphasize in the chart?'
