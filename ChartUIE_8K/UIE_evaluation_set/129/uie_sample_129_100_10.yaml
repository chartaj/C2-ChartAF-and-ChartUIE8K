initial_prompt: 'Please create a radar chart visualizing the Covid-19 statistics for
  various Indian states/UTs. Use the following data points for each state: Total Cases,
  Active Cases, Discharged Cases, Deaths, Active Ratio, Discharge Ratio, and Death
  Ratio. Represent each state as a separate axis on the radar chart and use different
  colors to distinguish between them. Make sure to include labels and a legend to
  identify each state/UT, and ensure the chart is clear and easy to read. The title
  should be "Covid-19 Statewise Comparison in India".'
