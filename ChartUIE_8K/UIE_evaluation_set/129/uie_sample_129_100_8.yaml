  I''d like a scatter plot using the latest Covid-19 India Statewise Data. The x-axis
  should represent the total population of each State/UT, and the y-axis should represent
  the total number of Covid-19 cases in each State/UT. Please include data labels
  for at least three sample states: ''Andaman and Nicobar'', ''Andhra Pradesh'', and
  ''Arunachal Pradesh''. The scatter plot should help to understand the relationship
  between population size and the total number of cases.
