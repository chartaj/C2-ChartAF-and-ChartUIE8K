initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map visualizing the latest Covid-19 data
  for different States/UTs in India. Use data from the CSV file, particularly focusing
  on the 'Total Cases', 'Active', 'Discharged', 'Deaths' columns. Ensure each state/UT
  is color-coded based on the total number of cases. Include labels for each region
  and a legend to make the map easily interpretable. This will help to understand
  the Covid-19 impact across various regions compared to their population. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used in the choropleth
  map?

  2. Do you want to include specific color thresholds for the ''Total Cases'' categories?

  3. Should the labels for each region include additional information like population
  or active cases?

  4. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or position of the legend?

  5. Would you like to highlight specific states/UTs that are of particular interest?

  6. Do you prefer a particular map projection or geography format for the map of
  India?

  7. Should the population be factored into the color intensity or displayed separately?'
