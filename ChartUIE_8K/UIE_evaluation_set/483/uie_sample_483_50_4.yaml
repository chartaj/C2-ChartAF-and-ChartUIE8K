initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013
  incl CC feedbacks)' on the Y-axis and 'Land Use (m2*year)' on the X-axis, color-coded
  by 'Original_Food'.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette in mind for distinguishing between
  different types of food?

  2. Would you prefer to include grid lines on the scatter plot?

  3. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  4. Should axis labels include units (e.g., ''kg CO2eq'' for GHG Emissions)?

  5. What level of detail should be used for axis ticks and labels?

  6. Do you want to include a legend indicating what each color represents?

  7. Should data points be labeled with their corresponding food type, or any other
  identifier?

  8. Do you have any preference for the size or shape of the data points on the scatter
  plot?

  9. Would you like to display a trend line to indicate the overall correlation?

  10. Is there any specific annotation or information you would like to highlight
  on the chart?'
