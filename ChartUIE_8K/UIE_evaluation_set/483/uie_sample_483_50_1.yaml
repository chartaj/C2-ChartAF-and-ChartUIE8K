initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to compare "Oat milk," "Almond milk," and "Rice
  milk" across multiple sustainability metrics like GHG Emissions, Land Use, Biodiversity,
  etc. Include detailed text annotations and highlights for key differences. Use a
  comparative emphasis on environmental impact metrics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the radar chart?

  2. Would you like to have separate colors for each type of milk?

  3. Do you prefer specific line styles or markers for each data series?

  4. Should the axes be limited to specific ranges, or should they be auto-scaled
  based on the data?

  5. How detailed do you want the text annotations to be: brief key points or more
  extensive explanations?

  6. Would you like to include any specific highlights or markers for significant
  differences between the metrics?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have preferences on its
  position or format?

  8. Do you want to include grid lines for better readability, and if so, what style
  do you prefer?

  9. Are there any specific fonts, sizes, or styles you prefer for annotation texts
  and labels?

  10. Would you like to include data labels directly on the chart, or just in the
  annotations?'
