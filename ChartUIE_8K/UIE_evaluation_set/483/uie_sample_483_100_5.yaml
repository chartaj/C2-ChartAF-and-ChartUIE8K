initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the environmental impact of different
  types of plant-based milk (Almond milk, Oat milk, Rice milk). The x-axis should
  represent "Land Use (m2*year)" and the y-axis should represent "GHG Emissions (kg
  CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)". The size of the bubbles should be determined
  by "Water Use (L)". Different colors should be used to distinguish between the types
  of milk. Include a legend for clarity. Title the chart "Environmental Impact of
  Plant-Based Milks".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between the
  types of milk?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations for each bubble to show the exact
  values of land use, GHG emissions, and water use?

  3. Do you have any preference for the size range of the bubbles on the chart?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have specific font preferences for the title, axis labels, and legend?

  6. Would you like to include any trend lines or reference lines in the chart?

  7. Is there any additional information or footnotes you want to include on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for the legend on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the axis ticks and labels?

  10. Would you like to highlight any particular data points or groups within the
  chart?'
