initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the environmental impacts of different
  milk alternatives (Almond milk, Oat milk, Rice milk). Use the environmental indicators:
  Land Use (m2*year), Arable Land Use (m2*year), Biodiversity (sp*yr*10^14), GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks), Acidification (g SO2eq), Eutrophication
  (g PO43-eq), Water Use (L), and Scarcity Weighted Water Use (L eq). The horizontal
  axis should display the milk types, and the vertical axis should list the environmental
  indicators. Each cell should reflect the value of the respective indicator for each
  milk type.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include value labels inside the heatmap cells?

  3. Should the color scale be linear or logarithmic?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range for the color scale (e.g., 0 to max value), or
  should it be automatically adjusted based on the data?

  5. How should missing values (if any) be represented in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to add a legend explaining the color intensity?

  7. Do you have any preferences for font styles and sizes for axis labels and titles?

  8. Should the heatmap include grid lines between cells?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the milk types and environmental
  indicators to be displayed?

  10. Would you like the heatmap to include annotations or additional notes?'
