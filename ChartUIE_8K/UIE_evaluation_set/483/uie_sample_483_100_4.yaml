initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq) and Land Use (m2*year) for different milk substitutes.
  Use 'Data S2 Name' to distinguish between types (Almond milk, Oat milk, Rice milk)
  in the plot. Highlight each one with different colors or markers. Annotate with
  original food sources (Nuts, Oatmeal, Rice) for added context. Ensure axes are labeled
  clearly. This will help compare the environmental impact of each milk alternative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to distinguish
  between the different milk substitutes?

  2. What type of markers would you prefer to use for each milk substitute (e.g.,
  circles, squares, triangles)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used for the annotations
  and labels?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors or markers used for
  each milk substitute?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the grid lines to be displayed (e.g.,
  dotted, solid, none)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the range or scale of the axes (e.g., start and
  end values, logarithmic scale)?

  7. Would you prefer any specific layout or position for the annotations in the scatter
  plot?

  8. Are there any additional elements or styling preferences you would like to include
  (e.g., title, subtitle, background color)?'
