initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the types of DNA mutations. Highlight
  the different mutation types ('Missense Substitution', 'Silent Substitution', etc.)
  with different colors. Add text annotations to show actual values of unique positions,
  reference codons, and query codons on each bar. This can help identify which mutations
  are most prevalent and draw attention to specific data points. Use highlights to
  emphasize important bars to clearly distinguish various mutation types. The chart
  should help in understanding the frequency and type distribution of mutations for
  further biological analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different mutation
  types?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., by frequency
  of mutation types or alphabetically)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font size and style of text annotations for
  values of unique positions, reference codons, and query codons?

  4. Should the bars have any particular width or spacing between them?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color coding of mutation types?

  6. Would you prefer specific labels or titles for the axes and the chart itself?

  7. Are there any specific bars or mutation types you would like to emphasize more
  than others?

  8. Do you have any preference for the display format of numerical values (e.g.,
  integer or decimal)?

  9. Would you like to include grid lines or not? If yes, any specific preference
  on their style?

  10. Is there a specific chart size or aspect ratio you have in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. By frequency of mutation types.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, include a legend.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Emphasize ''Missense Substitution'' and ''Silent Substitution''.

  8. Integer format.

  9. I am not sure.
