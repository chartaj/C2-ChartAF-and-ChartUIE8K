initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the mutation trends over
  positions in a DNA sequence. On the x-axis, plot the 'Position' values, and on the
  y-axis, show the counts of different 'Mutation_Type' (Missense Substitution, Silent
  Substitution, etc.). The chart should help us understand how mutation types vary
  across different positions in the DNA sequence. Make sure to distinguish each mutation
  type with different colors or line styles. This will help us to identify any patterns
  or hotspots for specific mutation types in the gene data we are analyzing for our
  biology research.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for distinguishing different ''Mutation_Type''?

  2. Would you prefer solid, dashed, or dotted line styles to differentiate the mutation
  types, or any other specific style?

  3. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  4. Do you need gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Would you like the chart to include labels or legends for the ''Mutation_Type''?

  6. Are there specific axis labels you would prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the chart text such as
  axis labels, title, and legend?

  8. Do you want to include any specific data points or markers on the lines?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart for better readability.

  5. Yes, please include labels or legends for the ''Mutation_Type''.

  6. X-axis: Position, Y-axis: Mutation Count.
