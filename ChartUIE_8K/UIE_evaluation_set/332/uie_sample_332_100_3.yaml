initial_prompt: I have data on DNA mutations from a CSV file. I want to visualize
  the mutation types across different positions in the sequence. Please create a heatmap
  that highlights the frequency or occurrence of each mutation type at each position.
  The x-axis should represent the Position, and the y-axis should represent the Mutation_Type.
  Each cell in the heatmap should display how often a particular mutation type occurs
  at that position, with a color gradient indicating the frequency. Make sure to include
  a color bar for reference.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. What should be the range of the color gradient for frequency?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels on both axes?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation or format of the color bar (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  6. Are there any particular gridline preferences for the heatmap (e.g., visibility,
  color, or thickness)?

  7. Would you like to add any titles or subtitles to the heatmap for better context?

  8. Do you have specific preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include a title: "Mutation Frequency Across DNA Positions".

  8. I do not have specific preferences.'
