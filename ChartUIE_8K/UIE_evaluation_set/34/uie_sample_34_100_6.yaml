initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the total spent (sum of MntWines,
  MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts, MntSweetProducts, and MntGoldProds)
  for each education level. I want to see how spending varies among different educational
  backgrounds. The x-axis should represent different education levels, and the y-axis
  should show the total spending amount. Include labels and title on the chart for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?

  2. Do you want the bars to be ordered in a specific way, such as ascending or descending
  order of total spending?

  3. Would you like to include the exact spending values on top of each bar for better
  clarity?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style and size of the labels on the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  5. Is there a specific font style or font size you would like to use for the chart
  title and labels?

  6. Would you like gridlines in the background of the chart? If yes, should they
  be major gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  7. Do you prefer a particular background color for the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, even though it only indicates total spending
  for each education level?'
