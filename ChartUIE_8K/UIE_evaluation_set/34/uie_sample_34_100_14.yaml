initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of customer spending
  across different categories. Use the 'MntWines', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts',
  'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts', and 'MntGoldProds' columns on the y-axis
  and label each category on the x-axis. Highlight outliers if any. Include appropriate
  labels for clarity. This will help in the Customer Personality Analysis to identify
  spending patterns and potential market segments based on customer purchase behavior.
  Make sure the chart is clear and easy to interpret for business analysis purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box plots?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be highlighted in a particular color or style?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font type or size for the labels and axis titles?

  5. Do you want grid lines for better readability of the chart? If yes, for both
  axes or just one?

  6. Is there any specific order you want for the categories on the x-axis?

  7. Would you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plots?

  8. Do you require a legend to be included in the chart?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or data points you would like to be explicitly
  marked on the chart?
