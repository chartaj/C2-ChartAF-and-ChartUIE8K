initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize customer spending behavior across
  different product categories like 'MntWines', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts', 'MntFishProducts',
  'MntSweetProducts', and 'MntGoldProds'. Use each product category as an axis and
  plot the average spending for different 'Marital_Status' categories. This will help
  in understanding which group (e.g., Singles, Married) spends more on different types
  of products, aiding targeted marketing strategies. Include a legend for 'Marital_Status'.
  Ensure the chart is clear and each axis is well-labeled for easy interpretation.

  categories?
