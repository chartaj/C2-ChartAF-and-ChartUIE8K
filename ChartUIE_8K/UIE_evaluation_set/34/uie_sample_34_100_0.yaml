initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between variables related
  to customer behavior and demographics. Highlight the correlation values to emphasize
  the strongest and weakest relationships. Annotate the heatmap with values indicating
  the strength of each correlation. Focus on key metrics like Income, total MntWines,
  MntMeatProducts, NumWebPurchases, and NumStorePurchases to uncover patterns in customer
  spending habits. The visualization will provide insights for customer personality
  analysis, aiding in strategic business decisions for marketing and sales. Utilize
  the annotation to highlight significant correlations for quick analysis.
