initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the total spending of customers
  across different product categories (MntWines, MntFruits, MntMeatProducts, MntFishProducts,
  MntSweetProducts, MntGoldProds), broken down by their Marital_Status. The x-axis
  should represent the Marital_Status categories, and the y-axis should represent
  the total amount spent. Each column should be stacked to show the contribution of
  different product categories to the total spending. This will help us understand
  spending patterns among different marital statuses for our Customer Personality
  Analysis. Use the dataset provided for accurate data representation.

  \ specific descriptions or labels?\n8. Would you like to have any specific annotations\
  \ or notes added to the chart? \n9. Do you prefer the chart to be oriented in a\
