initial_prompt: 'I want an area chart that visualizes Customer Personality Analysis
  focusing on their spending habits over different product categories. The x-axis
  should represent the products: Wines, Fruits, MeatProducts, FishProducts, SweetProducts,
  and GoldProds. The y-axis should show the total amount spent on these products.
  Please separate the spending by marital status with different shaded areas for categories
  like ''Single,'' ''Married,'' ''Together,'' etc. This will help us understand the
  spending patterns of customers based on their marital status over various product
  categories. The chart should clearly distinguish the spending trends across these
  groups.'
