initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Automobile Sales data. I'm
  interested in visualizing the relationship between SALES and QUANTITYORDERED. Plot
  the SALES on the Y-axis and QUANTITYORDERED on the X-axis. Use different colors
  or markers for different STATUS categories (like 'Shipped,' 'Pending,' etc.). Also,
  it would be helpful to add a trendline to see any patterns or correlations between
  these variables. Adding labels for different DEALSIZE categories will also help
  in understanding the distribution and sales performance across different order sizes.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different STATUS categories?

  2. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for each STATUS category?

  3. Would you like the trendline to be linear or polynomial?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the DEALSIZE labels?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be
  major, minor, or both?

  6. Do you have any specific title or subtitle for the scatter plot?

  7. Would you like the axes to be labeled in a particular way or with any specific
  formatting?

  8. Do you prefer any particular style or theme for the scatter plot (e.g., classic,
  modern, minimalistic)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for colors.

  2. I am not sure about specific marker shapes.

  3. A linear trendline would be fine.

  4. I do not have any preferences for the font style or size for the DEALSIZE labels.

  5. I would like both major and minor gridlines to be displayed.

  6. I do not know about the specific title or subtitle, any relevant one is okay.

  7. I am not sure about specific formatting for the axes labels.

  8. I have no specific preference for the style or theme of the scatter plot.'
