initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the sales and quantity ordered
  for each product line over different order dates. The x-axis should represent the
  product lines, grouped by order dates. Use one bar for sales and another bar for
  quantity ordered within each group. Additionally, color-code the bars to distinguish
  between sales and quantity ordered. Ensure the y-axis indicates the values appropriately
  and include a legend for clarity. This will help analyze the performance of product
  lines over time in the automobile sales data.
