initial_prompt: I need a Sankey chart to visualize the flow of automobile orders.
  Use the data to connect key points such as the 'COUNTRY' of the 'CUSTOMERNAME',
  'PRODUCTLINE', and 'STATUS' of the orders. It should show how many orders in each
  status (Shipped, On Hold, etc.) are associated with each product line and country.
  This will help identify which countries and product lines have the most shipped
  orders and any bottlenecks in processing. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to
  understand with distinct colors for each 'STATUS'.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for the different ''STATUS''
  categories?

  2. Would you like to highlight any specific paths or flows in the Sankey chart?

  3. How would you prefer to sequence the nodes (e.g., by order volume, alphabetically)?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and text on
  the chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the layout orientation (horizontal or vertical)
  of the Sankey chart?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or size constraints that we should consider
  for the chart?

  7. Do you require any annotations or summary statistics to be displayed on the chart?

  8. Are there any additional data points or attributes you would like to see included
  in the chart?'
