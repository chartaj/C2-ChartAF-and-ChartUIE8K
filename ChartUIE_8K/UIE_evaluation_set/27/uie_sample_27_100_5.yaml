initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the total SALES per
  CUSTOMERNAME, segmented by DEALSIZE. Each bar should represent a customer, and different
  segments within the bar should represent the sizes of the deals (Small, Medium,
  Large). Use different colors to distinguish the DEALSIZE segments. This will help
  in understanding the contribution of different deal sizes to the overall sales for
  each customer in the Automobile Sales data. Additionally, ensure that the chart
  includes data labels for better clarity and interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the DEALSIZE segments (Small,
  Medium, Large)?

  2. How would you like the data labels to be displayed? Should they show the actual
  sales value, percentage, or both?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to denote what each color represents for the
  DEALSIZE segments?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the chart''s labels and title?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, would you like them to be horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart''s orientation (vertical bars or horizontal
  bars)?

  7. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the chart to
  highlight key insights?

  8. Should the chart show only the top N customers based on total sales, or should
  it include all customers? If top N, please specify the number.

  9. Do you want the bars to be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending
  by total sales)?
