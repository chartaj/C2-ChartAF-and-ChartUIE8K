initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between MBA percentage
  scores (mba_p) and salaries, with annotations highlighting top salaries. Use different
  colors for genders to differentiate. The purpose is to study campus recruitment
  trends and understand salary distribution based on academic performance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  genders?

  3. Should the scatter plot include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style for the scatter plot points (e.g., circles,
  squares, triangles)?

  5. How would you like to handle the missing values in the salary data, if at all?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size of the points based on any additional variable
  (e.g., work experience)?

  7. Is there a specific range you want to set for the x-axis (MBA percentage scores)
  and y-axis (salaries)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for genders?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of labels and annotations?

  10. Should the plot include any specific title or subtitle to convey its purpose
  more clearly?'
