initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between different variables
  in the given dataset about campus recruitment and education. Include columns such
  as 'ssc_p', 'hsc_p', 'degree_p', 'etest_p', 'mba_p', and 'salary' to illustrate
  their relationships. Use the 'status' column to differentiate between placed and
  not placed students. Highlight notable interactions, especially focusing on how
  exam percentages and qualifications might influence recruitment status and salary.
  This heatmap will help identify patterns and significant factors impacting campus
  placements, providing valuable insights into the recruitment process and education's
  effect on employability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the ''status'' column to be visually differentiated in the
  heatmap?

  3. Do you want specific correlation values to be highlighted, and if so, what threshold
  should be used?

  4. Should the heatmap include annotations for the correlation values within the
  cells?

  5. Is there a specific placement or format you prefer for the heatmap legend?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., square cells, rectangular
  cells)?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the axes
  or as a main title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, include annotations for the correlation values within the cells.

  5. I am not sure.

  7. Main title: "Correlation Heatmap of Exam Percentages, Qualifications, and Recruitment
  Outcomes"'
