initial_prompt: Create a Sunburst chart showcasing the distribution of placements
  based on gender, education background (ssc_b, hsc_b), and specialization. Each layer
  should represent gender, then ssc_b, followed by hsc_b, and finally specialisation.
  Visualize the salary for "Placed" students in the inner ring.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for each gender, education
  background, and specialization?

  2. Would you like to display the exact salary values on the chart, or would you
  prefer an aggregated representation like average or median salary?

  3. How would you like the salary to be represented in the inner ring? Should it
  be a proportional segment based on the salary amount?

  4. Do you want to include labels and tooltips for each segment to provide more detailed
  information?

  5. Is there any particular ordering preference for the segments within each layer
  (e.g., alphabetically for education backgrounds and specializations)?

  6. Would you like the chart to highlight any specific segments or values, such as
  extreme salaries or a particular combination of attributes?

  7. Do you prefer to display additional metrics or context, such as the total number
  of placements or proportion of placements by category?'
