initial_prompt: I need a violin plot to visualize the distribution of student salaries
  (salary) placed through campus recruitment. Please color-code the plot by gender
  to compare the salary distribution between male and female students. Additionally,
  include a comparison based on whether the student had prior work experience (workex).
  Ensure that each category is clearly labeled. This will help us understand the impact
  of gender and work experience on the salary offered to students. Use proper titles
  and labels for the axes and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the labels of the axes?

  3. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for male and female categories?

  4. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the work experience
  categories?

  5. How would you prefer the legend to be displayed?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the order of categories along the x-axis?

  7. Do you prefer any specific formatting for the salary values on the y-axis?

  8. Are there any specific style preferences (e.g., font type, font size) for the
  labels and titles?'
