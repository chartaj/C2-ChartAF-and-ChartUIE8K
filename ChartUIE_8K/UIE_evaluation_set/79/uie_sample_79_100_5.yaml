initial_prompt: 'Create a Sunburst chart to visualize the Campus Recruitment data.
  Use the hierarchy: gender > ssc_b > hsc_s > degree_t > specialisation > status.
  For each level, show the number of students. The outermost ring should represent
  the ''status'' (Placed/Not Placed). Highlight proportions in each category, and
  ensure it''s clear how many students fall under each combination of categories to
  see trends in placement based on education background and specialization. This should
  help to understand how different factors influence campus recruitment outcomes.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Sunburst chart?

  2. Would you like specific labels or tooltips to display additional information
  on hover?

  3. Do you want the chart to show absolute numbers, percentages, or both for each
  category?

  4. Is there a specific ordering within each category that you prefer (e.g., alphabetical,
  by number of students)?

  5. Do you have specific preferences for the font style and size used in the chart?

  6. Should any specific categories be highlighted or emphasized more than others?

  7. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where on the chart should it be
  placed?

  8. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to add to the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific layout for the hierarchical levels, such as a radial
  layout or another style?

  10. Should the chart include separate sections or separators for different hierarchical
  levels for better visual distinction?'
