initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the dataset from the Campus Recruitment
  data, specifically focusing on the distribution of 'degree_p' (percentage in undergraduate
  degree) for the students. I want to compare how degree percentages are spread across
  different ranges. Make sure the x-axis represents the percentage ranges (e.g., 50-55,
  55-60, etc.) and the y-axis shows the number of students in each range. This will
  help me understand the common performance levels in undergraduate studies among
  the students. Include all available data points in the histogram. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart to better visualize the distribution?

  3. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, please provide the
  exact title.

  4. Do you have any preferences for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  5. How many bins would you like to use for the percentage ranges on the x-axis?

  6. Would you prefer the histogram to display the frequency of the data points or
  the density?

  7. Do you want any annotations or markers on the histogram to highlight specific
  ranges or values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Yes, please make the title "Distribution of Undergraduate Degree Percentages".

  4. Label the x-axis as "Degree Percentage" and y-axis as "Number of Students".

  5. Use 10 bins for the percentage ranges on the x-axis.

  6. I prefer the histogram to display the frequency of the data points.

  7. I do not know.'
