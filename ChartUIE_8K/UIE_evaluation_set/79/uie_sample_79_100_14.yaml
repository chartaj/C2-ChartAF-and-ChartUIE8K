initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart using the "Campus Recruitment" dataset.
  The chart should compare the average "degree_p" (undergraduate percentage) and "mba_p"
  (postgraduate percentage) scores for male and female students. Additionally, group
  the data by "status" (Placed/Not Placed) to show any trends or differences in scores.
  It's important to visualize how education percentages may correlate with placement
  status while differentiating by gender. This will help in analyzing the performance
  and placement trends among students across different education levels. Please ensure
  the chart is clear and labeled accurately.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for differentiating
  between male and female students?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for the "Placed" and "Not Placed"
  categories?

  3. Should the x-axis represent gender categories, status categories, or another
  grouping?

  4. Do you prefer specific labels or titles for the x-axis, y-axis, and the chart
  itself?

  5. Would you like to display numerical values on top of the bars for clarity?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or explanatory text within the chart
  to highlight key insights?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the categories (e.g., Placed before
  Not Placed)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the text within the
  chart?

  9. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have a preference for its
  placement?'
