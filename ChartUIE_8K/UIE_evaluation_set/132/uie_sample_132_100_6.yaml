initial_prompt: I want a bar chart displaying the number of forest fires in Brazil
  from 1998 to 2000. Use the 'state' as the category axis and the 'number' as the
  value axis. Each bar should represent the total number of fires per state annually.
  Additionally, include different colors for each year so I can easily compare the
  data. Make sure to label the axes clearly and provide a legend to differentiate
  the years. Also, include a title "Annual Forest Fires in Brazilian States" to give
  context to the chart. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for representing different
  years in the bar chart?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the chart title and axis labels?

  3. Do you have any preference for the order of states on the category axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by total number of fires)?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the bar width and spacing between the bars?

  6. Should the legend be placed at a specific position (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific visual elements or annotations you would like to include
  on the chart to highlight key data points or trends?

  8. Would you like the chart to follow a particular theme or style consistent with
  other visualizations or reports you use?'
answers: '1. I am not sure. Any distinct colors for each year will work.

  2. I do not know. Just use a legible font style and size.

  3. Alphabetical order would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  5. I have no specific preference for bar width and spacing.

  6. The legend can be placed at the bottom.

  7. I do not have any specific visual elements or annotations in mind.

  8. I do not have a particular theme or style in mind.'
