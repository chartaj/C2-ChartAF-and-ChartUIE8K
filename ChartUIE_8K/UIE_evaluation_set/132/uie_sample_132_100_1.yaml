initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the trend of forest fires in Brazil over
  the years. Highlight significant increases in fire numbers. Annotate key years where
  the number of fires changed drastically. The chart should have different lines representing
  various states and use different colors for each. Label the x-axis with years and
  the y-axis with the number of fires. Ensure the months are clearly labeled and any
  missing data points are noted. Provide context about environmental impacts in the
  annotations. Also, include a brief text annotation explaining the general trend
  observed from the data.

  6. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where would you prefer
  it to be positioned?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations?

  8. Do you want any gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?
  If yes, horizontal, vertical, or both?
