initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the Body Fat Prediction Dataset to visualize
  the relationship between BodyFat and Weight. Highlight data points with BodyFat
  less than 10% and greater than 30% in different colors. Add text annotations for
  the highlighted points to display their specific values. This will help identify
  individuals with exceptionally low or high body fat percentages, which can have
  significant health implications. The scatter plot should also include age as a color
  gradient to provide additional context on how body fat percentage varies across
  different age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you want specific x-axis and y-axis labels or should the default ones be used?

  3. Is there a preferred color scheme for the age gradient?

  4. What colors do you prefer for highlighting the low (<10%) and high (>30%) body
  fat percentages?

  5. Do you want a legend included to explain the color gradient and highlighted points?

  6. Should the size of the markers be uniform, or would you like to vary them based
  on another attribute (e.g., age or weight)?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the text annotations'' font size or
  style?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. The default ones are fine.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Highlight low body fat (<10%) in blue and high body fat (>30%) in red.

  5. Yes, please include a legend.

  6. Uniform size for the markers is fine.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, I would like grid lines included.'
