initial_prompt: I'd like to see a box plot visualizing the distribution of body fat
  percentage across different age groups from the Body Fat Prediction Dataset. Please
  divide the age groups into appropriate ranges (like 20-30, 30-40, etc.) and plot
  the body fat percentages for each range on the y-axis. Use the x-axis to represent
  the different age groups. Include whiskers to show the variability outside the upper
  and lower quartiles, and ideally, highlight any outliers. This would help in understanding
  how body fat distribution varies with age.
questions: '1. What age group ranges would you prefer for the x-axis? (e.g., 20-30,
  30-40, etc.)

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or style of the box
  plot?

  3. Should the box plot include any additional elements, such as mean markers or
  additional statistical annotations?

  4. Would you like to have grid lines displayed on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to be added to the axes
  or the chart overall?

  6. Would you like to apply any specific theme or background color to the chart?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I prefer the ranges 20-30, 30-40, 40-50, 50-60, and 60-70.

  2. I do not have any specific preferences for the color scheme or style of the box
  plot.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, I would like to have grid lines displayed on the chart for better readability.

  5. Please add labels for the x-axis (Age Groups) and the y-axis (Body Fat Percentage).
  The title should be "Body Fat Percentage Distribution Across Age Groups."

  6. I do not know.
