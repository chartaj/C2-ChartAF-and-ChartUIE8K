initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to body fat prediction, capturing various
  health metrics like Density, BodyFat, Age, Weight, Height, and measurements of different
  body parts (Neck, Chest, Abdomen, etc.). I want to visualize this dataset using
  a Treemap. The Treemap should allow me to see the distribution and relationship
  of these measurements in terms of their data type and missing values. Can you help
  create this Treemap so I can have a comprehensive overview of how these attributes
  are spread and interrelated in the context of health and body composition? Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Treemap?

  2. Would you like the tiles in the Treemap to be labeled with specific values such
  as ''mean'', ''median'', or ''missing values''?

  3. How would you prefer to categorize or group the measurements in the Treemap,
  e.g., by ''body part'', ''measurement type'', or any other criteria?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the size or layout of the Treemap tiles?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or additional text on the Treemap for
  clarification?

  6. How would you like the data type and missing values information to be visually
  represented in the Treemap?

  7. Should the Treemap highlight any particular attribute, such as missing values
  or unique values, more prominently?

  8. Are there any specific attributes you want to exclude from the Treemap visualization?

  9. Would you like to add any interactive features to the Treemap, such as tooltips
  or drill-down capabilities?

  10. Do you prefer the labels on the Treemap tiles to be full names or abbreviated
  forms?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. By ''body part'' would be preferred.
