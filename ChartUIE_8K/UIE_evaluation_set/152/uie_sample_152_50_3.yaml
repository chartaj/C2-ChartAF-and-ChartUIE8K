initial_prompt: Create a set of small multiples bar charts showing the average values
  of different body measurements (like Weight, Height, Neck, Chest, etc.) categorized
  by Age groups. This should help visualize trends in body measurements across different
  ages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar charts?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for easier comparison between age groups?

  3. How would you like the age groups to be defined? (e.g., age ranges such as 20-29,
  30-39, etc.)

  4. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the bar charts?

  5. Would you like to see error bars to represent variability in the data?

  6. Should we include labels for the average values directly on the bars?

  7. Is there any specific ordering you prefer for the body measurements on the charts?

  8. Do you want legends to describe each age group, or is it sufficient to have them
  on the x-axis?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for clarity in the charts?

  10. Would you like to normalize the data (e.g., z-scores) for better comparison?

  11. How detailed should the axis labels be? (e.g., just ''Weight'' or ''Average
  Weight (kg)'')

  12. Do you have a preferred title format and subtitle for each of the small multiples?

  13. Should each chart have the same y-axis scale, or should it be auto-adjusted
  for each body measurement?'
