initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of BodyFat among
  different Age groups from the Body Fat Prediction dataset. Use text annotations
  to mark the average BodyFat percentage and highlight significant peaks in the distribution.
  This will help focus on specific age groups with notable BodyFat levels, aiding
  in health analysis. The aim is to identify trends and anomalies to better understand
  body fat distribution across different ages for health purposes. Highlight key age
  groups representing fitness or obesity for better visual emphasis. Ensure the histogram
  is clear and easy to interpret with appropriate labels.
