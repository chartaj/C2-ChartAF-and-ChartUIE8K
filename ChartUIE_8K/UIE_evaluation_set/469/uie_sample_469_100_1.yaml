initial_prompt: 'Create a table chart visualizing the share of CO2 emissions from
  air travel and the share of the world population for different income groups: High
  income, Upper-middle income, and Lower-middle income countries. Use text annotations
  to highlight the key data points for easy reference and to draw attention to significant
  differences. The purpose is to understand the environmental impact of air travel
  emissions concerning population distribution. Highlights should be used to emphasize
  the higher emissions from high-income countries despite their smaller population
  share. This will help in environmental science studies to identify key areas for
  emission reduction strategies.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the higher
  emissions from high-income countries?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to indicate the different income groups?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font size or style for the text annotations?

  4. Is there a specific layout you prefer for the table chart, such as a certain
  order for the columns or rows?

  5. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or notes in the
  chart?

  6. Are there any specific data point markers or symbols you would prefer to use
  in the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  modern, classic, minimalist)?

  8. Should the chart include any explicit labels or titles for each of the columns
  and rows?'
