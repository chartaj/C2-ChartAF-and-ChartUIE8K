initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart visualizing the share of CO2
  emissions from air travel as well as the share of the world population across different
  income groups. Use data from high income, upper-middle income, and lower-middle
  income countries. Include the shares as columns on the x-axis and the percentage
  values as the y-axis. Segment the columns by income groups to show the proportion
  of emissions and population share for each group. Title the chart "CO2 Emissions
  vs Population Share by Income Group" for clarity in our environmental-science study.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different income
  groups in the stacked column chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the columns for the percentage values?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  4. Should there be gridlines on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  5. Would you like to have separate legends for ''share of CO2 emissions from air
  travel'' and ''share of world population'', or a combined legend?

  6. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the income groups on the x-axis?

  7. Are there any specific margin or padding settings you would like to apply to
  the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional text descriptions or annotations on
  the chart?'
