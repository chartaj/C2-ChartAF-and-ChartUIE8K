initial_prompt: Please create a column chart to visualize the data from the file 469.csv.
  The chart should have three bars for each category (High income countries, Upper-middle
  income countries, and Lower-middle income countries). The first set of bars represents
  the share of CO2 emissions from air travel, and the second set represents the share
  of the world population. Label the x-axis with the income categories and the y-axis
  with the percentage values. Use different colors to distinguish between the two
  data sets. Add appropriate titles and legends to make the chart clear and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  the two data sets?

  specific data points?'
