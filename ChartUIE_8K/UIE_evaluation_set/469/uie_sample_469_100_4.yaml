initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the share of CO2 emissions
  from air travel and the share of the world population among different income countries.
  The segments should represent high-income, upper-middle-income, and lower-middle-income
  countries. Additionally, make sure to include labels for each income group and percentages
  for clarity. This chart will help us understand the distribution of air travel emissions
  relative to the population by income group. Use distinct colors for each segment
  to differentiate between the income groups clearly. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each income group segment
  in the donut chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels in the chart?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the colors used for each
  income group?

  4. Do you have specific preferences for the placement of the labels and percentages
  within or outside the donut segments?

  5. Do you want any additional text or annotations on the chart to provide more context
  or explanations?

  6. Are there specific size dimensions for the chart you would prefer to fit into
  a report or presentation?

  7. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If yes, what would you like them
  to be?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like the chart to include a legend.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. No additional text or annotations are necessary.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the chart should include a title and subtitle. Title: "CO2 Emissions from
  Air Travel by Income Group", Subtitle: "Distribution Relative to World Population"'
