initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart to compare the shares of CO2 emissions from air
  travel across different income groups. Use data from file 469.csv with the columns:
  ''share of CO2 emissions from air travel'' and ''share of world population''. Plot
  ''High income countries'', ''Upper-middle income countries'', and ''Lower-middle
  income countries'' on the x-axis, with two bars per group representing ''share of
  CO2 emissions from air travel'' and ''share of world population''. Ensure the chart
  clearly shows the disparity between CO2 emissions and population share in these
  groups. Add appropriate labels and a legend.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bars representing ''share
  of CO2 emissions from air travel'' and ''share of world population''?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked?

  3. Do you prefer specific font styles or sizes for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or left to auto-scale based on the
