initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the shares of CO2 emissions from air
  travel against the share of the world population for different income countries.
  Highlight the proportion of emissions for each country group to emphasize disparities.
  Use color variations to distinguish each country's income category and add textual
  annotations to display the exact percentages of emissions and population shares.
  This visualization aims to provide an intuitive understanding of how CO2 emissions
  from air travel are distributed among countries with different income levels, emphasizing
  which income groups have the highest and lowest contributions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each income category?

  2. Would you prefer the annotations for percentages to be inside or outside the
  treemap sections?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you would like the textual annotations
  to adhere to?

  4. Should the treemap maintain a specific aspect ratio (e.g., square, rectangular)?

  5. Are there any particular border styles or widths you prefer for the treemap sections?

  6. Do you have a preference for how the income categories are ordered within the
  treemap?

  7. Would you like any additional labels or legends to be included in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color preferences.

  2. I would prefer the annotations for percentages to be inside the treemap sections.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  4. The aspect ratio can be rectangular.

  5. I am not sure about the border styles or widths.

  6. I do not have a preference for how the income categories are ordered.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding for each income category.'
