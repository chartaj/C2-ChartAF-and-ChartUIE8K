initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the share of CO2 emissions from
  air travel with the share of the world population for different income countries.
  Highlight and annotate bars for "High income countries" and "Upper-middle income
  countries" to emphasize their significant contributions to CO2 emissions despite
  their smaller population shares. Use color to differentiate income groups. The chart
  should clearly show the disparity between population share and CO2 emissions, providing
  contextual annotations to guide viewers on these key insights, essential for understanding
  environmental impact and policy-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the income
  groups?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for "High income countries" and "Upper-middle
  income countries"?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for annotations (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  4. What specific information would you like included in the annotations?

  5. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for the text and annotations?

  6. Would you like a specific title for the chart?

  7. Should there be any additional labels or captions for context?

  8. Do you want grid lines in the background for better readability, and if so, in
  what style?

  9. Would you prefer the legend to be displayed in a specific location?

  10. Are there any specific aspect ratios or dimensions you would like for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. High income countries: Red, Upper-middle income countries: Blue.

  3. Text boxes.

  4. Highlight their significant contributions to CO2 emissions compared to their
  world population share.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, "CO2 Emissions from Air Travel vs. World Population Share by Income Group".

  7. Yes, including captions for context would be helpful.
