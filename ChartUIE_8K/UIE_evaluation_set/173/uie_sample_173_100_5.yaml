initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the evolution of the average song
  popularity ('pop' column) over the years from 2010-2019. Use the provided dataset
  of top Spotify songs for this time period. The x-axis should represent the years
  and the y-axis should represent the average popularity. Each point on the chart
  should indicate the average popularity of songs released in that particular year,
  and connect these points to show the trend over the decade. This will help illustrate
  how music popularity has changed over time.
