initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart that compares R&D Investment among different countries.
  Use text annotations to display the investment values for the top 3 countries: United
  States, China, and Japan, and highlight these bars in different colors. Additionally,
  show R&D Investment as a percentage of GDP for added context. This visualization
  will help analyze government spending on R&D and emphasize the importance of investment
  in innovation. Include contextual notes to explain the significance of these investments
  related to economic growth and technological advancements. The x-axis should list
  the countries, and the y-axis should measure the investment in billion USD.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for highlighting the bars representing
  the top 3 countries?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Where would you like to position the text annotations on each bar?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order in which countries appear on the x-axis?

  5. Are there any specific types of contextual notes or examples you want to include
  to explain the significance of the investments?

  6. Would you prefer a particular style or format for the contextual notes (e.g.,

  axis or incorporated directly within the chart?

  8. Are there any specific styling preferences for the chart, such as color scheme,
  grid lines, or background?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific colors. Maybe you can choose some that will

  chart would be good.

  3. I am not sure, wherever it looks best and is most readable.

  4. I have no specific preference for the order on the x-axis.

  5. Maybe an example or note on how R&D investment drives technological advancements
  and economic growth.
