initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing R&D Investment (Billion USD) on
  the x-axis and R&D Investment as % of GDP on the y-axis for different countries.
  Use data-driven text annotations for the United States, China, and Japan to highlight
  their specific values on the plot. Employ highlights to make these three countries
  stand out visually from the others, aiming to emphasize their significant investment
