initial_prompt: Iâ€™d like to visualize the relationship between customer demographics
  and their status (Exited or Not) using a stacked column chart. I'd like one axis
  to represent different demographic factors like 'Geography', 'Gender', and 'Age
  Group', and the other axis to represent the number of customers. Each column should
  be stacked to show the proportion of 'Exited' and 'Not Exited' customers within
  each demographic. This will help us understand which customer segments are more
  likely to leave the services. Could you please create this visualization? Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme of the chart,
  especially for ''Exited'' and ''Not Exited'' segments?

  2. Would you like the age groups to be predefined ranges (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.)
  or dynamically calculated?

  3. Should the chart include data labels displaying the exact numbers or percentages
  for each segment within the columns?

  4. Do you prefer any specific order for the demographic factors (e.g., Geography,
  Gender, and then Age Group)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend that explains the meaning of different colors
  used in the stacked columns?

  6. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the chart, x-axis,
  and y-axis?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart text elements (titles,
  labels, legends)?

  8. Should any demographic factor categories (e.g., specific age groups or geographies)
  be emphasized or highlighted in any specific way?

  9. Do you prefer the chart background to be plain or contain some form of grid lines
  or background pattern?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you''d like to include in the
  visualization to provide context for the audience?'
