initial_prompt: Visualize a histogram of 'CreditScore' to understand its distribution
  among customers. Highlight bins where the 'Exited' rate is high to focus on customers
  who left. Add text annotations indicating average 'Age' per bin to provide context.
  Use color coding to distinguish between 'Geography' regions and gender. This will
  help analyze demographic patterns in credit scoring and identify potential factors
  contributing to customer exit. This chart aids in targeting retention strategies
  based on credit scores and demographics in business analysis.
