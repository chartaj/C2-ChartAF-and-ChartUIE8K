initial_prompt: I would like a scatter plot for the given dataset from the Deep Learning
  A-Z - ANN dataset. Please plot "Age" on the x-axis and "CreditScore" on the y-axis.
  Differentiate the points by "Gender" using different colors. Additionally, use different
  markers to represent whether the customer "Exited" or not. This way, I can visualize
  the correlation between age, credit score, gender, and the status of exit. Make
  sure to include legends for clarity and provide appropriate labels for the axes
  and title.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific title or wording you''d like for the chart
  title?

  2. Do you have any preferred colors for differentiating genders?

  3. Do you have any specific preference for the markers representing whether the
  customer exited or not?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart?

  5. How would you prefer the legend to be placed on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the labels and title?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the x-axis (Age)
  and y-axis (CreditScore)?

  8. Would you like to see any trend lines or regression lines on the scatter plot
  to assist in visualizing the correlation?

  9. Do you prefer the data points to be displayed with any specific size or transparency
  settings?

  10. Should the chart include any annotations or data labels on specific points?'
