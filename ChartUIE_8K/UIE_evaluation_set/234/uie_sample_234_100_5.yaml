initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the trends in customer behavior over
  time for the Deep Learning A-Z - ANN dataset. Specifically, I want to examine how
  the CreditScore, Age, Balance, and EstimatedSalary change across different customers.
  The x-axis should represent the RowNumber, and the y-axis should display the respective
  data values. Separate lines for CreditScore, Age, Balance, and EstimatedSalary will
  help to clearly understand the trends and fluctuations. Please make sure to differentiate
  each line with distinct colors or styles, and include a legend for clarification.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color palette or specific colors for\
  \ each line representing 'CreditScore', 'Age', 'Balance', and 'EstimatedSalary'?\n\
  2. Should the lines be solid, dashed, or do you prefer specific line styles for\
  \ each attribute?\n3. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart to make\
  \ it easier to read values?\n4. Would you like the chart to include data point markers\
  \ for each value on the lines?\n5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for\
  \ the axes labels and legend?\n6. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so,\
  \ do you have specific wording in mind for these titles?\n7. Do you want to add\
  \ any specific annotations or reference lines (e.g., average lines, important thresholds)\
  \ to the chart? \n8. Do you prefer a specific ordering or hierarchy for the lines\
  \ in the legend?\n9. Should the chart include any specific instructions or notes\
  \ for the audience?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette. Any distinct colors would be fine.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the line styles.

  3. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  4. I am not sure, but including data point markers might be useful.

  5. I do not know, any standard font style and size would be okay.

  6. Yes, please include axis titles. "RowNumber" for the x-axis and "Values" for
  the y-axis would be good.

  7. No, I do not have any specific annotations or reference lines in mind.

  8. I have no specific preference for the order of lines in the legend.

  9. No specific instructions or notes are needed for the audience.'
