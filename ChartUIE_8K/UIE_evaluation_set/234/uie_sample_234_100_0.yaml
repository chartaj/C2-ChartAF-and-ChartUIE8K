initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize customer churn from the dataset. Highlight
  key demographic factors like CreditScore, Geography, Gender, and Age. Use text annotations
  to show specific values for notable correlations, such as the relationship between
  Age and CreditScore with churn (Exited). The practical purpose of this visualization
  is to understand which demographics are more likely to churn and to strategize customer
  retention actions. Make highlights using color variations to distinguish between
  different churn rates across various ages and credit scores for better insights
  into customer behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. What range of color variations would you like to use to indicate different churn
  rates?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color coding?

  5. Would you like specific labels or titles for the axes or the heatmap itself?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds for churn rates that should be highlighted
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical orientation for the demographic factors
  displayed on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred layout or structure you would like for the demographic factors
  on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like a range of color variations from green (low churn) to red (high
  churn).

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend to explain the color coding.

  5. Yes, please include clear labels for the axes and a title like "Customer Churn
  Heatmap by Demographic Factors".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.
