initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique values
  in the YearsExperience and Salary columns from the given dataset. Use data-driven
  text annotations to highlight specific segments, displaying their corresponding
  values in the chart. For example, annotate slices showing unique salary values or
  experience lengths. Highlight the segments with the most and least unique values
  to emphasize their importance visually. This will help viewers quickly identify
  key data points and understand data distribution patterns effectively. The purpose
  is to focus attention on significant statistical elements in a simple linear regression
  context.
