initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of obstacle occurrences
  in different seasons from the Ninja Warrior games data. Include text annotations
  to highlight the most frequent obstacles and their popularity across seasons. Use
  highlights to emphasize the top three obstacles that appear most often. This will
  help in understanding which obstacles are most commonly faced by participants in
  various season stages. The chart helps identify key challenges in the game structure,
  aiding in analyzing skill requirements for participants.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the sections of the
  pie chart?

  2. Are there any preferred fonts or font sizes for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the top three obstacles to be highlighted (e.g., different
  colors, bold borders)?

  4. Should the legend display specific colors for each obstacle, or should it just
  be alphabetical?

  5. Do you want each season to be represented by a unique color or pattern in the
  chart?

  6. Are there any specific format requirements for the text annotations (e.g., bold,
  italic)?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title, and if so, do you have a preferred
  title?

  8. Should the percentage distribution of obstacles also be displayed on the pie
  chart slices?

  9. Is there a preferred arrangement for the season data within the pie chart (e.g.,
  chronological order)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the size or dimensions of the pie chart?'
