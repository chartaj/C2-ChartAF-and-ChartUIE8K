initial_prompt: "Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the obstacles in Ninja Warrior\
  \ based on the season and their order. Use data from seasons 1 to 10, grouped by\
  \ location and round stage. Each bar should represent an obstacle name with its\
  \ order as the value. Ensure the bars are grouped by season and location on the\
  \ x-axis and color-coded by round stage. Additionally, include a legend to distinguish\
  \ between round stages. This should help in understanding the progression and variety\
  \ of obstacles across different seasons and locations. \n\nFormat the chart to include\
  \ labels for the axes and a title."
