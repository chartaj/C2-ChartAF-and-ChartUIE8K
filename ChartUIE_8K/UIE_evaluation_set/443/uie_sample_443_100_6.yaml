initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualization for the ninja warrior obstacle
  course data. Please plot each obstacle's order across different seasons, using different
  colors for each location. Also, the points should be differentiated based on the
  round stage. The X-axis needs to represent the seasons, while the Y-axis will display
  the obstacle order. This will help analyze the consistency and evolution of obstacle
  orders in various locations over time. Display the names of some key obstacles as
  labels on the plot to make it insightful. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating locations?

  2. Are there specific obstacles you consider "key" for labeling on the plot?

  3. How would you like the round stages to be differentiated (e.g., shapes, sizes
  of the points)?

  4. Should there be a legend to differentiate locations and round stages?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the style and font of the labels for key obstacles?

  6. What are your preferences for the axis titles and overall chart title, if any?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included on the plot for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please label the "Warped Wall," "Salmon Ladder," and "Rope Climb."

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, include a legend to differentiate locations and round stages.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. X-axis title: "Seasons," Y-axis title: "Obstacle Order," Chart title: "Evolution
  of Ninja Warrior Obstacle Orders by Location and Stage."

  7. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.'
