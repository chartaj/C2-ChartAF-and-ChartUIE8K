initial_prompt: Could you create a box chart that visualizes the distribution of 'obstacle_order'
  in different 'round_stage' across various 'seasons'? It would help to understand
  the variability and consistency of obstacle placement throughout the competition.
  Use the 'season' to categorize the data along the x-axis, and plot the 'obstacle_order'
  on the y-axis, with separate box plots for each 'round_stage'. This will provide
  a clear comparison of obstacle difficulties over time and stages in the competition.
  The data comes from various ninja warrior games involving obstacle courses.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different ''round_stage''
  box plots?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., modern, classic)?

  4. Should the chart include a title and subtitles? If so, do you have specific text
  for them?

  5. Do you want to display the median values on the box plots?

  6. Should we include whiskers to show the range of variability outside the upper
  and lower quartiles?

  7. Do you want to include data labels for the quartiles or outliers?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units specified?

  9. Do you have a preferred font type or size for axis labels and titles?

  10. Would you like to include a legend to explain the different ''round_stage''
  categories?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a title. The title could be "Distribution of Obstacle
  Order by Round Stage and Season". No specific preference for subtitles.

  5. Yes, display the median values on the box plots.

  6. Yes, include whiskers to show the range of variability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, label the x-axis as "Season" and the y-axis as "Obstacle Order".

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, include a legend to explain the different ''round_stage'' categories.'
