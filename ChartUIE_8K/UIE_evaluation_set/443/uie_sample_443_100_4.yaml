initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the distribution of obstacle types
  by order in each round stage for different locations and seasons in the Ninja Warrior
  games. Each bar should represent a unique obstacle, grouped by the stages in the
  competition and color-coded by location. Include legends for season, location, and
  round stage. Ensure the x-axis shows obstacle names and the y-axis displays the
  obstacle order. This visualization aims to highlight obstacle frequency and order
  variations across different rounds, thereby providing actionable insights for game
  planners on course design and difficulty progression.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order, such as ascending or descending
  based on obstacle order?

  3. Do you want any specific font or font size for the axis labels and legends?

  4. Do you prefer to display data labels on the bars for better clarity?

  5. Is there any specific way you would like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  6. How detailed should the gridlines be on the chart (e.g., light, moderate, or
  heavy)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart for
  clarity?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines or standards you prefer to follow for color-blind
  accessibility?'
