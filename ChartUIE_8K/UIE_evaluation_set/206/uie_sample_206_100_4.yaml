initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the Housing Prices dataset. Please create a
  histogram that displays the distribution of house prices. Ensure it effectively
  shows the frequency of different price ranges within the dataset. Also, include
  a separate histogram for the distribution of house areas. These histograms will
  help me understand the variation in house prices and areas. Make sure each histogram
  is clear and properly labeled, showing the data ranges and frequency counts. Include
  different colors for each histogram to easily distinguish between the two distributions.
  Thanks!
