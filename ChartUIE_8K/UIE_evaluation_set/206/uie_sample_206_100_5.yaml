initial_prompt: '"Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between various features
  of the Housing Prices Dataset. Include all numeric columns such as price, area,
  bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, etc. Ensure the heatmap clearly shows the
  strength of correlations with a color gradient. Highlight significant correlations
  that could reveal trends or patterns useful for real-estate analysis."'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display correlation coefficients as numerical values
  on the cells?

  3. Are there specific significance thresholds you want to use to highlight strong
  correlations?

  4. Do you prefer the heatmap to be sorted in any specific order, such as by correlation
  strength or alphabetically by feature names?

  5. Are there specific features you would like to be highlighted or focused on in
  the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or labels on the heatmap to make it
  more informative for the audience?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like the heatmap to display correlation coefficients as numerical
  values on the cells.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.
