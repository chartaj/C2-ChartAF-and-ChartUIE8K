initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualization for the Housing Prices
  Dataset. Plot 'area' on the x-axis and 'price' on the y-axis to understand the relationship
  between property size and price in the real estate market. Use different colors
  or markers to distinguish between furnishing status ('furnished', 'semi-furnished',
  'unfurnished'). Ensure mainroad status ('yes' or 'no') is depicted through different
  symbols or a legend. This will help in identifying how mainroad access and furnishing
  status affect property prices and area. Additionally, provide gridlines for better
  readability. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for distinguishing
  between furnishing statuses?

  2. How would you like the symbols for mainroad status (e.g., shapes like circles,
  squares, triangles) to be represented?

  3. Should the chart include titles and labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If so,
  what should they be?

  4. Would you like a gridline at specific intervals or a general gridline for better
  readability?

  5. Do you prefer any specific range limits for the x-axis (''area'') and y-axis
  (''price'')?

  6. Would you like to include a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should it
  be?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font size and style for labels and legends?

  8. Should the legend be positioned in a specific part of the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  9. Would you like to add data point markers or labels to highlight specific properties?

  10. Do you have specific preferences for the background color of the chart?'
