initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing housing prices along with various attributes
  like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, mainroad, guestroom, basement, hot water
  heating, air conditioning, parking, preferred area, and furnishing status. Please
  create a grouped bar chart to compare the average prices of houses based on the
  number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The x-axis should show the number of bedrooms
  and bathrooms grouped together (e.g., 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom, 3 bedrooms 2 bathrooms),
  and the y-axis should show the average price of houses in each group. Use different
  colors to distinguish between the number of bedrooms. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars representing each number
  of bedrooms?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for easier readability?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact average price values on
  each bar?

  5. Are there any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratio you would like to maintain?

  6. Would you like to customize the legend''s position or style in the chart?

  7. Are there any specific title or subtitles you would like to add to the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  9. Should there be any annotations or reference lines on the chart to emphasize
  certain data points?'
