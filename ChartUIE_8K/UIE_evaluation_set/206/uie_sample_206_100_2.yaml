initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing housing prices based on area, bedrooms,
  bathrooms, and additional features such as mainroad and air conditioning. Highlight
  houses with 4 stories and those that have guest rooms to show any patterns. Include
  text annotations for the most expensive and least expensive houses to draw attention
  to their specific attributes. This will help viewers understand how different features
  impact housing prices in this real-estate dataset. Highlight unique patterns in
  these properties by modifying dot sizes or colors to make the insights clearer and
  more engaging.

  colors or shapes?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout of the plot (e.g., aspect ratio, arrangement
  of axis)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading to enhance readability?

  7. Should we include a legend explaining the colors and sizes used in the dot plot?

  8. Do you prefer to use any specific fonts or text sizes for annotations and labels?

  9. Are there any specific themes or design aesthetics you would like the chart to
  follow?

  10. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?'
