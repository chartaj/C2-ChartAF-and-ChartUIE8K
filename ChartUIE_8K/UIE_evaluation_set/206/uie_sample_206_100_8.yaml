initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization for the Housing Prices Dataset. I want
  the treemap to display the hierarchical structure of different house features such
  as price, area, bedrooms, bathrooms, stories, parking, and furnishingstatus. Each
  house should be represented as a square with its size determined by the 'price'
  attribute. Other attributes should be used to group and color the blocks accordingly.
  For example, use 'bedrooms' to group similarly sized homes and 'furnishingstatus'
  for color differentiation. Ensure that the Treemap clearly shows patterns and clusters
  based on the provided data attributes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Which color scheme do you prefer for differentiating ''furnishingstatus''?

  2. Would you like to use a specific color palette for the ''bedrooms'' grouping?

  3. Do you have a preference for the chartâ€™s background color?

  4. How would you like clusters and patterns to be highlighted or annotated in the
  Treemap?

  5. Should there be any specific labels or tooltips displayed for each block in the
  Treemap?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels within the Treemap?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or categories of ''price'' you want to emphasize
  or highlight?

  8. Would you like to include legends or keys to explain the color and size differentiation?
  If yes, where would you like them to be positioned?

  9. Do you have preferences for the layout of the Treemap, such as padding or margin
  sizes between blocks?

  10. Should the Treemap include any additional information like a title, subtitle,
  or footnote? If so, please specify.

  11. Are there specific patterns or clusters you are particularly interested in identifying
  in the Treemap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer a light background color.

  4. Highlight clusters and patterns with borders or shading.

  5. Display labels for each block with price and bedrooms.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Emphasize ''price'' ranges with clear color contrasts.

  8. Yes, include legends or keys on the right side.

  9. I do not have preferences for margins.

  10. Yes, include a title: "Housing Prices Treemap".

  11. I am particularly interested in patterns for high-priced homes.'
