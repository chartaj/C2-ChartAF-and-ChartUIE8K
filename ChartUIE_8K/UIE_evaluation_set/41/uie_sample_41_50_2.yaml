initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between
  'DYRK1A_N' and 'ITSN1_N' proteins. Annotate significant outliers and highlight points
  based on 'Genotype' and 'Treatment' categories. This will help in understanding
  the protein expression patterns in control and treated mice groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between ''Genotype''
  and ''Treatment'' categories?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be annotated (e.g., specific labels, different
  marker shapes, or sizes)?

  3. Should the axes have specific labels or units displayed?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the plot, and if so, should they be light or prominent?

  5. Would you prefer the data points to have markers, and if so, do you have specific
  shapes or sizes in mind for markers?

  6. Do you want to include any statistical lines, such as a trend line or a regression
  line, to show the correlation?

  7. Should legends be included, and if so, where would you prefer them to be placed
  on the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  9. Should there be a title on the scatter plot, and if so, what would you like it
  to be?'
