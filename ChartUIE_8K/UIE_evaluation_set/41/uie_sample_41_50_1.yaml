initial_prompt: Please create a boxplot for the Mice Protein Expression dataset. Highlight
  the distribution of selected protein expressions like DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, and BDNF_N
  across different genotypes and treatments, and add data-driven text annotations
  for the median values.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different genotypes and treatments?

  2. Would you like to include custom labels or titles for the axes and the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific format for the data-driven text annotations for the
  median values?

  4. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the boxplot to follow (e.g.,
  minimalistic, detailed)?

  5. Would you like to highlight outliers if there are any? If yes, how would you
  prefer them to be marked?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations and legend?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability or should they be
  minimized?

  8. Do you want to add a legend to differentiate between different genotypes and
  treatments?

  9. How would you like to handle missing values in the dataset: omit, fill, or mark
  them explicitly?

  10. Would you like to add any additional statistical summaries (like mean or interquartile
  range) alongside the median annotations?'
