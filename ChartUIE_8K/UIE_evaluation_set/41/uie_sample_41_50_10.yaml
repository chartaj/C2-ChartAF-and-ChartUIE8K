initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap of protein expression levels across different
  mice samples, highlighting varying intensities for each protein studied, ranging
  from DYRK1A_N to CaNA_N. Include Genotype, Treatment, and Behavior as categorical
  labels on the axes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., viridis,
  plasma, coolwarm)?

  2. How would you like the color intensity to be scaled (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  3. Would you like to include a color bar to indicate the protein expression levels?

  4. Do you want to cluster the heatmap by rows, columns, or both?

  5. Should missing values be highlighted in a specific color or left blank?

  6. Would you prefer the heatmap to include or exclude axis labels for better readability?

  7. Do you want to add any annotations (e.g., values, labels) to specific cells in
  the heatmap?

  8. Should the categorical labels (Genotype, Treatment, Behavior) be grouped in a
  specific order on the axes?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?

  10. Would you like grid lines to separate cells in the heatmap for easier comparison?'
