initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the expression levels of pAKT_N, pERK_N,
  and BDNF_N over different MouseIDs from the "Mice Protein Expression" dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing pAKT_N,
  pERK_N, and BDNF_N?

  2. Would you like to include data point markers along the lines for better visibility?

  3. Should we include a legend to clearly identify each protein expression level
  line?

  4. Do you have a specific range for the y-axis you want to be displayed, or should
  it be automatically scaled?

  5. Would you prefer gridlines to be shown in the background for easier reading of
  the chart?

  6. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to be added to the chart?

  7. Would you like to label the x-axis as ''MouseID'' and the y-axis appropriately,
  or do you have another preference?

  8. Do you want to display any specific trends or average lines (like moving averages)
  alongside the actual data?

  9. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the labels and text
  on the chart?

  10. Would you like the MouseID labels on the x-axis to be displayed at an angle
  to prevent overlap if there are many data points?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, please include data point markers.

  3. Yes, include a legend.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  7. Yes, label the x-axis as ''MouseID'' and the y-axis appropriately.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, display the MouseID labels on the x-axis at an angle to prevent overlap.'
