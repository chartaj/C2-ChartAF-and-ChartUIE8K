initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the protein expression levels
  (e.g., DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, BDNF_N) across different MouseIDs grouped by Genotype
  and Treatment.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different protein expression
  levels?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted by any specific criteria, such as MouseID
  or protein levels?

  3. Should the y-axis display the actual values of protein expression levels or percentages?

  4. Do you prefer specific labels or annotations on the chart for clarity?

  5. Are there any specific data points you want to highlight or emphasize in the
  chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred orientation for displaying the chart (vertical or horizontal
  bars)?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  8. Should we include a legend to differentiate between the protein expression levels?

  9. Is there any particular font or style you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  10. Would you like to display error bars or variability markers for protein expression
  levels?'
