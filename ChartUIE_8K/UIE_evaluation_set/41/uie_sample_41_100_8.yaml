initial_prompt: I have a dataset on mice protein expression. I need a histogram visualizing
  the distribution of protein levels for any three proteins (e.g., BDNF_N, ERK_N,
  and GFAP_N) across different mice. Use the protein expression values, ignoring missing
  data, and categorize them by 'Genotype' (Control vs. Ts65Dn). Make sure to use different
  colors for each genotype to clearly distinguish them in the histogram. Also, include
  a legend and labels for the X-axis (Protein Expression Levels) and Y-axis (Frequency).
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the Control and Ts65Dn
  genotypes in the histogram?

  2. Is there a particular bin width or number of bins you would like for the histogram?

  3. Would you like the histogram to have any specific title or text annotations?

  4. Should the X-axis range be standardized across all three proteins, or should
  each have its range?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for axis labels and legend text?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the histogram for better readability?

  7. Do you want the histograms for each protein to be displayed separately or overlaid
  in the same chart for comparison?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the histograms to follow (e.g., BDNF_N,
  ERK_N, GFAP_N)?

  9. Do you have any other specific requirements or preferences for the chart layout
  or design?'
