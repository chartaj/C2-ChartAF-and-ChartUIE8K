initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of protein
  expression levels across various proteins for each mouse categorized by genotype,
  treatment, and behavior. Highlight the proteins with the highest and lowest median
  expression levels. Annotate these highlighted proteins with their mean values to
  provide additional context. The purpose of this visualization is to identify potential
  patterns or outliers in protein expression linked to different genotypes, treatments,
  or behavioral outcomes. This will help in understanding the biological variations
  and impacts on protein levels in the study titled "Mice Protein Expression." Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the proteins
  with the highest and lowest median expression levels?

  2. Would you like specific shapes or symbols to represent different genotypes, treatments,
  or behaviors?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to see on the chart,
  beyond the mean values of highlighted proteins?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have a specific orientation, such as vertical or horizontal
  box plots?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different categories and highlights?

  6. Are there particular fonts or text sizes you prefer for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  7. Is there a specific range or scale you want to use for the protein expression
  levels on the axes?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Do you want to display individual data points within the box plots, such as markers
  for each mouse?

  10. Are there any additional statistical measures you''d like to include, such as
  mean lines or confidence intervals on the box plots?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Other than the mean values of highlighted proteins, I do not have specific preferences.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the different categories and
  highlights.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
