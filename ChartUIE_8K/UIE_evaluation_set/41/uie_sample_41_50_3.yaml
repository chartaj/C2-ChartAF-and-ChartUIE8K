initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize the average expression levels of
  selected proteins (e.g., DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, BDNF_N, NR1_N) for different mouse genotypes
  across various treatments. Highlight differences between genotypes and treatments.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for each genotype and treatment?

  2. What labels would you like to use for the axes representing the selected proteins?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability of values?

  4. Would you prefer the protein expression levels to be averaged and displayed as
  a single line for each genotype and treatment, or separate lines for each combination?

  5. Do you have a preference for the scale of the axes (e.g., fixed range or auto-scaling
  based on data)?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the proteins to be arranged
  on the radar chart?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to identify different genotypes and treatments?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the chart title or axis labels?

  9. Do you have a preferred style for highlighting the differences (e.g., different
  line styles, thickness, or markers)?'
