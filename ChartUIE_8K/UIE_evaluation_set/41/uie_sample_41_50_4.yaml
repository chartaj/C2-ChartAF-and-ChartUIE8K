initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart displaying the protein expression levels
  for 'BRAF_N', 'CAMKII_N', and 'CREB_N' for the first three mice. Group the bars
  by MouseID and differentiate the proteins by color. Title the chart "Protein Expression
  in Control Mice with Memantine Treatment".
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  the proteins?

  2. Would you like the y-axis to be set to a specific range?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels'' font size and style?

  4. Should the chart include a grid for easier comparison of protein levels?

  5. Would you like data values to be displayed directly on the bars?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which the proteins are displayed within
  each group?

  7. Should there be any specific annotations or notes within the chart?

  8. Would you like a legend included, and if so, do you have a preferred position
  for it?

  9. Do you have any preference for the bars'' width and spacing?
