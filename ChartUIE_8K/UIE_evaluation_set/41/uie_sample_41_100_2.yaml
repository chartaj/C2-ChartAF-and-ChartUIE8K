initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Mice Protein Expression data.
  I want to visualize the relationship between the 'BDNF_N' and 'pJNK_N' protein expressions
  across different MouseID samples. Highlight data points based on 'Genotype' and
  'Treatment' values to distinguish between Control and Treatment groups. Include
  data-driven text annotations for outlier points, if any, to draw attention to those
  specific elements in the chart. This will help to better understand the effects
  of different treatments on protein expressions in mice. Make sure the annotations
  stand out clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the ''Control''
  and ''Treatment'' groups based on ''Genotype'' and ''Treatment'' values?

  2. How would you prefer the outlier data points to be annotated? Would you like
  specific information included in the annotations?

  3. Where would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the data points on the scatter plot?

  5. What font style or size would you like for the annotations to ensure they stand
  out clearly?

  6. Would you like the axes to be labeled with specific titles or units of measurement?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, what style
  would you prefer for the gridlines?

  8. Is there a specific range or scaling you would prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall layout and design of the
  chart (e.g., margin sizes, background color)?

  10. Are there any additional elements or specific details you would like to include
  in the chart to enhance the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme, use your best judgment.

  2. I am not sure, maybe include the MouseID and values of ''BDNF_N'' and ''pJNK_N''.

  3. I do not know, place it where you think it fits best.

  4. I have no specific preference, use a standard size.

  5. I do not have a specific preference, just make sure it is clear and readable.

  6. Yes, please label the axes with appropriate titles.

  7. I am not sure, follow the usual standard for gridlines.

  8. I do not know, use an automatic range that fits the data.

  9. I do not have any specific preferences, go with a professional look.

  10. No additional elements, just focus on making the chart easy to understand.


  Thank you!'
