initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the protein expression levels from
  the "Mice Protein Expression" dataset. Use the protein names listed in the 'Column'
  field, excluding 'MouseID', 'Genotype', 'Treatment', 'Behavior', and 'class'. The
  heatmap should show the expression levels for the three samples provided ('309_1',
  '309_2', '309_3'). Color code the protein expression values, with different colors
  representing low, medium, and high expression levels. Exclude proteins with missing
  values from the heatmap. Title the heatmap "Mice Protein Expression Heatmap".
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to represent low,
  medium, and high protein expression levels?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include value annotations on the cells, or should
  it only display colors?

  3. How would you prefer missing values to be handled or indicated if they arise
  during the visualization process?

  4. Should the heatmap display gridlines between cells, or would you prefer a seamless
  appearance?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type and size for the title
  "Mice Protein Expression Heatmap" and other labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding of the expression
  levels?

  7. Do you want the protein names to be displayed along both axes, or should they
  be limited to one axis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer missing values to be excluded from the heatmap.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, I would like to include a legend to explain the color coding of the expression
  levels.

  7. The protein names should be displayed along one axis.'
