initial_prompt: Create a small multiples chart to visualize the Mice Protein Expression
  data. Each multiple represents a specific protein (e.g., DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N) with
  its expression levels across different MouseIDs. Use line plots or bar charts for
  each protein, and group them by unique combinations of Genotype, Treatment, and
  Behavior. Add axis labels, legends, and titles to clarify the protein names and
  conditions. Make sure the missing values are handled appropriately by either marking
  them or interpolating. This visualization will help compare protein expressions
  across different experimental conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title format for each small multiple/chart?

  2. Would you prefer line plots or bar charts for visualizing the protein expressions?

  3. How would you like the proteins to be grouped within the chart layout?

  4. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for different proteins or
  experimental conditions?

  5. Do you have any preferences for handling missing values (e.g., marking them,
  interpolating them)?

  6. Would you like a specific font style or size for the axis labels, legends, and
  titles?

  7. Is there a preferred width and height for each individual chart in the small
  multiples?

  8. How would you like the legend to be displayed (e.g., at the bottom, side, with
  each chart)?

  9. Are there specific units or scaling desired for the protein expression levels
  on the axis labels?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the grid layout of the small multiples
  (e.g., number of columns, rows)?'
