initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart visualizing protein expression levels
  over time for three selected proteins: DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, and BDNF_N. Use the MouseID
  as the x-axis to represent individual mice samples and the protein levels as the
  y-axis. Distinguish different proteins using color-coded lines. Include legend labels
  for clarity. Ensure the chart clearly showcases the expression patterns among the
  samples in the dataset for easy comparison of the protein levels. The line chart
  should also reflect Genotype, Treatment, and Behavior for comprehensive analysis.
  Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing the
  different proteins?

  2. Would you like specific marker styles or shapes to be used for the data points
  on the lines?

  3. Do you have font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Do you prefer the line chart to include grid lines, and if so, in which orientation
  (horizontal, vertical or both)?

  5. Should the Genotype, Treatment, and Behavior be displayed as annotations or color-coded
  within the chart, and if so, how would you like them to be represented?

  6. Do you want to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  7. Would you like any specific ranges or limits set on the y-axis for highlighting
  certain expression levels?

  8. Should the chart include data point values displayed directly on the graph?

  9. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the legend (e.g., position,
  style)?

  10. Do you have any preferences on the background color or style of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preferences for marker styles or shapes.

  3. I have no specific preference for font sizes or styles.

  4. I prefer grid lines in both orientations.

  5. I think color-coding Genotype, Treatment, and Behavior within the chart would
  be helpful.

  6. No specific titles or subtitles are needed.

  7. I do not have any specific ranges or limits for the y-axis.

  8. I am not sure if displaying data point values directly is necessary.

  9. I have no specific formatting preferences for the legend.

  10. I have no preferences on the background color or style.'
