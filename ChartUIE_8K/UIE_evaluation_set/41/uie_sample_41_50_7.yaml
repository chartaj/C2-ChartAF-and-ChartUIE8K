initial_prompt: Create small multiples to compare the protein expression levels across
  different proteins like DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, BDNF_N, and others for various combinations
  of genotype, treatment, and behavior in mice.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout or grid arrangement for the small multiples?

  2. What color palette or scheme would you like for representing different proteins
  or conditions?

  3. Should the axes be standardized across all small multiples, or should each panel
  have independent scaling?

  4. Do you prefer specific chart types for each multiple (e.g., bar charts, line
  charts) to represent the protein expression levels?

  5. Would you like to include any specific labels, legends, or annotations in the
  small multiples?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styles you want for the text elements in the
  charts?

  7. Should the small multiples be ordered in a specific way (e.g., by increasing
  protein expression)?

  8. Do you require any specific gridlines or reference lines within each panel?

  9. Would you like to highlight or emphasize certain data points or conditions in
  the charts?'
