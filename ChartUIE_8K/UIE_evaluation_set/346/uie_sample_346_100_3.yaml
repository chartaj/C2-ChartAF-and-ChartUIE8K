initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the relationship between different platforms
  and their global sales from the video game sales data. Each dot represents a video
  game, with the x-axis showing the platform type and the y-axis showing global sales
  in millions. Include a legend to distinguish different genres represented by different
  dot colors. The plot should help us identify which platforms have the highest and
  lowest sales, and highlight the distribution of sales across various genres and
  platforms effectively. This information will help in understanding the market trends
  in global video game sales.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  different genres?

  2. Would you like the dots to have varying sizes based on another attribute (e.g.,
  year of release), or should they all be the same size?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for easier readability of the data points?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Should platforms be sorted in a particular order on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by number of games, or total sales)?

  6. Is there a specific range or limit you would like to set for the y-axis (global
  sales in millions)?

  7. Would you like data points to display additional information such as game names
  on hover or click?'
