initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the global video game sales data. Use
  the 'Genre' column to categorize the blocks and 'Global_Sales' for the block sizes.
  Within each genre, further divide by 'Platform' to show distribution. Each block
  should represent a game, and the size should reflect its global sales. Ensure that
  missing values are handled appropriately and include a legend for clear interpretation
  of the data. Highlight the top-selling games across different genres and platforms.
