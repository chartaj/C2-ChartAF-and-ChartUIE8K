initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the global video game sales
  data. I would like to see the relationship between the release year and the global
  sales. Use different colors or markers to represent various genres. Additionally,
  highlight the data points for games published by "Nintendo". Ensure the axes are
  clearly labeled, with "Year" on the x-axis and "Global Sales (Millions)" on the
  y-axis. Include a legend for the genres. Thank you!

  specific color, marker shape)

  be?'
