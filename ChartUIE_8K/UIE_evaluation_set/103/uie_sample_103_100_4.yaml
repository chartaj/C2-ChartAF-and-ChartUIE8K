initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the sales data using a dot plot. Specifically,
  I want to see how the ratings vary by product line across different cities - Yangon,
  Naypyitaw, and Mandalay. Each dot should represent an individual rating, with the
  x-axis showing the product lines and the y-axis representing the rating scores.
  Additionally, it would be helpful to differentiate the dots by color based on the
  customer's gender to observe any trends or patterns. Could you create a dot plot
  incorporating these elements for the business sales dataset? Thank you!
questions: '1. What size would you prefer for the dots on the plot?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating male and female
  customers?

  3. Is there a particular order you would like the product lines to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  4. Would you prefer any specific data point annotations, such as city labels, to
  be visible on the plot?

  5. What range of rating scores do you want to be displayed on the y-axis? Should
  it be from 0 to 10, or something different?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels? If
  so, what should they be?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included in the plot to explain the color coding
  of genders?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or background of the plot
  (e.g., gridlines, background color)?

  9. Should outlier data points be highlighted or treated in a special way? If yes,
  how?

  10. Do you want to display the exact numerical rating values when hovering over
  the dots on the plot?'
