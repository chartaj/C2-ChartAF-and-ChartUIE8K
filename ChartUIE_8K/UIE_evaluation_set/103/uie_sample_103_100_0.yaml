initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of different branches
  and customer types in this sales dataset. Highlight the branches with the most sales
  and use annotations to show the percentage of each customer type. This will help
  us understand which branches and customer types contribute most to our revenue.
  Emphasize cities and product lines as well to provide additional context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like specific labels for each segment of the pie chart?

  3. Should the chart include a legend or should the segments be directly annotated?

  4. What level of detail should be included in the annotations? (e.g., just percentage,
  both count and percentage)

  5. How would you like the branches with the most sales to be highlighted? (e.g.,
  different color, bold outline)

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the annotations?

  7. Should the cities and product lines be incorporated into the pie chart, or should
  they be included in auxiliary charts or notes?

  8. Would you like any specific sorting order for the pie segments? (e.g., descending
  order by sales)

  9. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want to include on the chart?

  10. Should the pie chart have any specific background or grid lines?'
