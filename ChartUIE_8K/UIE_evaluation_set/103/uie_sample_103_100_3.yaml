initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of unit prices
  and quantities across different product lines from the sales dataset. The x-axis
  should represent the six product lines, and the y-axis should show two metrics:
  unit price and quantity. This will help compare the variability and median values
  of unit prices and quantities for each product line. Ensure each product line is
  distinctly marked and color-coded for clarity. Additionally, include outliers in
  the box chart to show any extreme values. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors used to distinctly mark each
  product line?

  2. Would you prefer the box plots for unit price and quantity to be side by side
  for each product line or stacked vertically?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style of outliers, such as dots or crosses?

  4. Should the y-axis for unit prices and quantities share the same scale for easier
  comparison, or should they be independently scaled?

  5. Is there a specific layout or positioning for the legend you prefer?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations or labels on the chart to highlight key
  insights or medians?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the colors.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Dots for outliers would be fine.

  4. They should be independently scaled for better clarity.

  5. No specific preference for the legend positioning.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific preference for font styles or sizes.'
