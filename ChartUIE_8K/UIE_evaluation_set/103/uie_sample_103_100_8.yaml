initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the sales dataset. Please create a
  plot showing the 'Total' sales amount for each 'Product line'. Make sure each product
  line's sales are aggregated. Use different colors for each bar to distinguish the
  product lines clearly. This view should help us compare the overall performance
  of different product sections. Also, include labels for the total sales amount on
  top of each bar for better readability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or any specific colors in mind
  for the bars representing each product line?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the labels on top of each bar?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which
  product line, or do you prefer labeled bars?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the product lines (e.g., ascending/descending
  by sales amount)?

  5. Would you like the Y-axis to start at zero, or should it be adjusted to better
  fit the range of data?

  6. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include on the chart?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  9. Would you like the data values on top of the bars to be rounded to a certain
  number of decimal places?

  10. Are there any other specific annotations or features you would like to be included
  in the chart?'
