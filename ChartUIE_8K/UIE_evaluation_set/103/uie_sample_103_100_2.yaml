initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize sales trends over time, using
  the provided sales dataset. The x-axis should represent the 'Date' and the y-axis
  should depict the 'Total' sales amount. Implement text annotations to highlight
  key data points with exceptionally high or low totals. Use highlights to distinguish
  between different branches ('Branch' column), changing the line color for each branch.
  This will help in understanding branch-wise sales performance over time. Ensure
  the chart is clear and labeled properly to provide insights into sales patterns
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for distinguishing different branches?

  2. What specific date format would you prefer on the x-axis (e.g., "MM/DD/YYYY"
  or "Month Year")?

  3. Are there specific sales thresholds that define ''exceptionally high'' or ''low''
  totals for annotations?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like gridlines in the background to aid in reading the chart? If so,
  should they be major, minor, or both?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the x-axis, y-axis, and
  the chart itself?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for the different branches?

  9. Is there a specific time range that you want the data to be focused on or highlighted?

  10. Do you need any additional reference lines or markers on the chart (e.g., average
  sales line)?'
