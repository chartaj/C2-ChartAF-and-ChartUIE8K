initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the difference in memory scores
  before and after taking the drug for each individual in the data. The x-axis should
  represent the memory score before taking the drug, and the y-axis should represent
  the memory score after. Differentiate the points by the 'Happy_Sad_group' using
  different colors and indicate the dosage on each point. This should help visualize
  any patterns or correlations between mood groups, drug dosage, and changes in memory
  scores. Make sure to include a legend and appropriate labels for clarity.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the 'Happy_Sad_group'?\n\
  2. What style and size do you prefer for indicating the dosage on each point?\n\
  3. Are there any specific axis scales or ranges you would like to set for the x\
  \ and y axes?\n4. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot, and if so, in which\
  \ style?\n5. Is there a particular font or size preference for the labels and legend?\
  \ \n6. Do you want to include specific markers or shapes for the data points?\n\
  7. Should there be any specific title for the scatter plot?\n8. Would you like additional\
  \ annotations or data labels on any specific data points?\n9. Is there a particular\
  \ order for the legend items you prefer?"
