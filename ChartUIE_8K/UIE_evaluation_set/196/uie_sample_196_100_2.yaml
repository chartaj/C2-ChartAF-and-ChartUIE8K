initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the "Memory Test on Drugged Islanders
  Data" from the psychology study. The chart should plot 'Mem_Score_Before' and 'Mem_Score_After'
  on the y-axis against 'age' on the x-axis for different 'Drugs'. Use lines to connect
  the memory scores before and after drug administration for each individual. Highlight
  individuals who show significant changes in their memory scores with different colors
  or sizes. Include data-driven text annotations for these significant changes to
  focus attention on key elements. Additionally, provide context for what the data
  represents at the beginning of the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme of the lines
  representing different drugs?

  2. Would you like to use solid lines, dashed lines, or another line style to denote
  different drugs?

  3. Do you have a threshold for what constitutes a "significant" change in memory
  scores that you would like to highlight?

  4. Would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed as callouts or embedded
  within the chart area?

  5. Do you want the context text at the beginning of the chart to be presented as
  a title, a subtitle, or a separate annotation box?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations and context
  text?

  7. Are there specific colors or sizes you would like to use to highlight individuals
  with significant changes in memory scores?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart to make it easier to read, and if so, at
  what intervals?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors and lines representing
  different drugs and significant changes?

  10. Do you want any specific markers or symbols for the individual data points before
  and after drug administration?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, let''s consider a "significant" change to be a change of greater than 10
  points in memory scores.

  4. I do not know.

  5. As a subtitle would be fine.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, use red and larger sizes to highlight significant changes.

  8. Yes, gridlines would be helpful. I am not sure about the intervals.

  9. Yes, please include a legend.

  10. I am not sure.'
