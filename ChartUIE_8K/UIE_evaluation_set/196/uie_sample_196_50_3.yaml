initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart comparing 'Mem_Score_Before' and 'Mem_Score_After'
  for each 'Drug' across 'Happy_Sad_group'. Use different colors for 'H' and 'S'.
  Include age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between ''Happy''
  and ''Sad'' groups?

  2. Would you like specific age group ranges to be defined, or should the age be
  treated as a continuous variable?

  3. Should the age groups be shown as separate segments within the bars or as labels
  aside the bars?

  4. Do you prefer any particular order for the drugs to be displayed (alphabetically,
  by effect size, etc.)?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or highlights on the chart, such as significant
  differences or thresholds?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  7. Are there any specific axis labels or legends you prefer?

  8. Would you like to include error bars or standard deviations for the memory scores?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the age group ranges, so use common or default ranges.

  3. Separate segments within the bars for age groups would be good.

  4. I am not sure about the order; use what you think is best.

  5. I do not know about specific annotations or highlights.

  6. A simple title like "Comparison of Memory Scores Before and After Treatment"
  is fine.

  7. I do not have specific preferences for axis labels or legends.

  8. I am not sure about including error bars or standard deviations.
