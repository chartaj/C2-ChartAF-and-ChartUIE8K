initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the average star ratings of ramen
  brands across different countries. Focus on trends over time, highlighting popular
  varieties that have received higher ratings. Use data annotations to emphasize high-rating
  points and provide additional context, such as brand names and styles. This visualization
  will help identify top-performing brands and countries in the ramen industry, aiding
  consumers and businesses in decision-making. The chart should also differentiate
  between various ramen styles, such as "Cup" and "Pack," to offer deeper insights
  into consumer preferences.
