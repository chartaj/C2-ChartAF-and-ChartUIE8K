initial_prompt: I have a dataset from the "Ramen Ratings" category that includes reviews
  of ramen brands from various countries. I'd like to create a geographic heatmap
  to visualize the data. The heatmap should highlight the density of ramen variety
  ratings by country. Each country should be colored based on the number of reviews
  it has, with nuances showing how highly the ramen from that country were rated.
  Please ensure the map is interactive, allowing for zooming in on specific countries
  for detailed information.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the rating nuances to be displayed (e.g., gradient, distinct
  color ranges)?

  3. Do you prefer any particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  4. Would you like the country boundaries to be highlighted or emphasized in any
  way?

  5. Should there be any specific thresholds for coloring based on the number of reviews
  (e.g., above 100 reviews in a darker shade)?

  6. Do you want any labels or tooltips to appear when hovering over countries?

  7. Is there a specific type of legend you prefer for the heatmap (e.g., continuous
  gradient bar, discrete categories)?

  8. Are there any specific countries or regions of focus that you want to emphasize?

  9. Do you need a sidebar or additional panel to display detailed information when
  a country is clicked?'
