initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for the "Ramen Ratings" dataset. The chart should
  show the average star ratings for different ramen styles. Each bar will represent
  a ramen style (e.g., Cup, Pack) on the x-axis, and the y-axis will represent the
  average rating. Include data for all available styles and ensure the chart is easy
  to read with labels for both axes and a title "Average Ratings by Ramen Style".
  This will help visualize which ramen styles generally receive higher ratings. Please
  use different colors for each bar to differentiate between the styles clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the bars?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  3. Would you like the chart to include data labels on the bars to show the exact
  average ratings?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  angled)?

  5. Should there be any specific gridlines or background elements to enhance readability?

  6. Are there any additional annotations or legends you would like to include in
  the chart?'
