initial_prompt: I need a stacked area chart showing GameStop's historical stock prices
  over time. The x-axis should display the dates, while the y-axis should display
  the price values. Different segments within the area chart should represent open
  price, high price, low price, and close price to visualize their variations day
  by day. Include volume as another shaded area for additional context. Make sure
  that the chart is easy to read and understand, with each price type clearly differentiated
  by color. This will help in visualizing how GameStop's stock has fluctuated. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  the price types (open, high, low, close prices) and volume?

  2. How would you like the volume to be represented in the chart - as a separate
  shaded area at the bottom of the chart or an overlay on the primary price segments?

  3. Would you prefer a specific date range to be displayed on the x-axis, or should
  it include the entire dataset?

  4. Are there any specific labels, annotations, or markers that you would like to
  be included in the chart for better readability?

  5. What level of granularity would you like for the x-axis (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the y-axis scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Are there any specific aspects of the chart (e.g., font size, axis labels, grid
  lines) that you would like to customize for better readability and presentation?'
