initial_prompt: I have a dataset of GameStop historical stock prices with columns
  like date, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume, and adjclose_price.
  I want to create a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between these variables
  over time. Please use the data to plot a correlation matrix heatmap. Make sure it
  includes all the columns and highlights relationships, especially focusing on how
  close_price correlates with volume and other price metrics. Additionally, the heatmap
  should be visually appealing, with a color gradient that clearly shows variations
  in correlation strength. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient used in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include annotations within the heatmap cells to display the
  correlation coefficient values?

  3. Is there a specific color palette you prefer for highlighting strong vs. weak
  correlations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of correlation values (e.g., -1 to 1)
  represented in the color gradient?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include in the heatmap
  (e.g., title, axis labels)?

  6. Would you like to adjust the size of the heatmap or the individual cells for
  better readability?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the heatmap labels and annotations?

  8. Should the heatmap include grid lines separating the cells, and if so, do you
  have any preference for their style and color preferences?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, I would like to include annotations within the heatmap cells.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. No specific labels or titles are necessary.

  6. I do not have a preference for the size; just ensure it''s readable.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for grid lines.'
