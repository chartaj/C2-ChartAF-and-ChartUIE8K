initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing historical stock prices for GameStop,
  with fields such as date, open price, high price, low price, close price, volume,
  and adjusted close price. I would like to create a Candlestick chart that visualizes
  the stock performance over time. The x-axis should represent the trading dates,
  and the y-axis should represent the stock prices. Each candlestick should show the
  open, high, low, and close prices for each day. This visualization will help in
  understanding the daily price movements and overall stock trend. Please ensure the
  chart is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the candlesticks (e.g., green
  for gains and red for losses)?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style and font of axis labels and chart title?

  4. Would you like to add annotations or markers on specific dates to highlight significant
  events?

  5. Should the chart include volume data as a subplot or integrated into the main
  chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific date format for the x-axis labels?

  7. Would you like to set specific date ranges for the x-axis to focus on a particular
  time period?

  8. Do you have any preference for the line thickness of the wicks and bodies of
  the candlesticks?

  9. Should the chart include a moving average or other technical indicators?

  10. Are there any specific legends or labels you would like to see on the chart?'
