initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing GameStop's historical stock
  prices over time. The x-axis should represent the date, and the y-axis should show
  the closing prices. Highlight significant events where the stock had unusual spikes
  or drops in volume. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight dates with extreme
  high or low prices to direct attention to these points. This visualization will
  help in analyzing the price movement patterns and understand how specific events
  impacted stock performance over a period of time. Thank you!
