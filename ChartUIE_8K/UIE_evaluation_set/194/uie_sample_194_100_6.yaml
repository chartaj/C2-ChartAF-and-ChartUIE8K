initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 data. Could
  you create a chart that shows the count of unique values for the 'class' column?
  I'd like to see how many 'STAR' and 'GALAXY' entries there are. This will help visualize
  the distribution of celestial objects in our dataset. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?\n2.\
  \ Should the chart include axis titles and labels? If yes, do you have any specific\
  \ titles in mind?\n3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for\
  \ better readability?\n4. Should the bar chart display the exact count of unique\
  \ values on top of each bar? \n5. Do you have any specific font preferences for\
  \ the text in the chart?\n6. Would you like the chart to include a legend?\n7. Do\
  \ you prefer the bars to be horizontal or vertical?\n8. Do you have any specific\
  \ preferences for the chart background color?"
