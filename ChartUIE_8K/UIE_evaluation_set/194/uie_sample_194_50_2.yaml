initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the 'class' categories (STAR
  and GALAXY) based on their associated 'redshift' values. Use annotations and highlights
  to emphasize significant redshift variations. This visualization will help understand
  object classifications in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer any particular style for the annotations and highlights?

  3. Should there be labels on the individual bars to indicate specific redshift values?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the ''class'' categories (STAR and GALAXY)
  to be displayed in?

  6. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include a title and subtitles for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  8. Are there any specific axis labels you''d like to include for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  9. Should the chart focus on any particular range of redshift values?

  10. Do you have any preference for the font style and size used in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include labels on the individual bars to indicate specific redshift
  values.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a preference for the position of the legend.

  7. Yes, include a title and subtitles. The title should be "Redshift Comparison
  of STAR and GALAXY Classes in SDSS DR14", and the subtitle can be "Understanding
  Variations in Redshift Values for Different Object Classifications".

  8. Yes, the x-axis label should be ''Class'', and the y-axis label should be ''Redshift''.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
