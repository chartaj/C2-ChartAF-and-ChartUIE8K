initial_prompt: Create a hexbin plot showing the density distribution of 'ra' vs 'dec'
  for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 data. Highlight areas with a high concentration
  of data points.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting areas with high concentration?

  2. Do you have a specific range of ''ra'' and ''dec'' values you would like to focus
  on?

  4. Should the color intensity scale be linear, logarithmic, or any other preference?

  5. Do you want to include axis labels and titles? If so, what should they be?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to indicate the density levels?

  7. Are there specific color boundaries or thresholds you want to use for identifying
  high-density areas?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font type or size for the chart annotations?'
