initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 data.
  Visualize changes in the 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', and 'z' magnitudes across different
  'ra' values. Plot 'ra' on the x-axis and the magnitudes on the y-axis. Differentiate
  each magnitude (u, g, r, i, z) with separate lines in the chart. Ensure each line
  is uniquely colored for clarity. This will help in analyzing how these magnitudes
  vary with the change in 'ra'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme for each magnitude line
  (u, g, r, i, z)?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart have a title? If so, what would you like it to be?

  4. Do you want labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they be?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate each magnitude line?

  6. Do you prefer data points to be marked on the lines, or should the lines be smooth
  without markers?

  7. Should the axis ranges be fixed or auto-scaled based on the data?

  8. Do you have any preference for the line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  magnitude line?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or specific markers for key points
  of interest on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like grid lines for better readability.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, labels for the x-axis as ''RA'' and the y-axis as ''Magnitude'' would be
  good.

  5. Yes, a legend is necessary to differentiate each magnitude line.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Auto-scaled based on the data.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. I am not sure.'
