initial_prompt: Create a violin plot for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset
  showing the distribution of 'redshift' for different 'class' categories ('STAR'
  and 'GALAXY').
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the violin plot?

  2. Should the plot have a legend specifying the ''class'' categories (''STAR'' and
  ''GALAXY'')?

  3. Do you want to include summary statistics (like mean or median) within each violin
  plot?

  4. How would you like the axes to be labeled for clarity?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for easier data comparison?

  6. Do you prefer any particular scale (linear or logarithmic) for the ''redshift''
  axis?

  7. Would you like to include confidence intervals or any other statistical annotations?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the ''class'' categories to
  be displayed?

  9. Do you want to display individual data points within the violin plot?

  10. Should the plot include a title? If yes, what should it be?'
