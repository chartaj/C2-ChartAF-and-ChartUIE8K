initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between the various
  magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z) and redshift for astronomical objects cataloged by the
  Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14. Use `class` to differentiate between `STAR` and `GALAXY`.
  The x-axis should list the magnitude and redshift columns, while the y-axis represents
  different objects. Apply distinct color gradients to highlight variations and correlations.
  Ensure you also label each axis and include a legend for clarity. This will help
  visualize magnitude relations to redshift per object class, aiding in astronomical
  research and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color gradients for highlighting variations
  and correlations in the heatmap?

  2. Is there a specific label you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have any preferences on how the legend should be formatted or positioned?

  4. Are there any specific objects or object classes you want to highlight in the
  heatmap?

  5. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the heatmap to indicate
  important data points or ranges?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I am not sure about specific color gradients. Any distinct gradients that clearly
  differentiate between variations and correlations would be fine.

  2. For the x-axis: "Magnitude and Redshift", and for the y-axis: "Objects".

  3. I do not have any specific preference for the legend formatting or positioning.

  4. I do not know. Including all objects from `STAR` and `GALAXY` classes would be
  sufficient.

  5. I am not sure, maybe just standard annotations or markers as needed for clarity.
