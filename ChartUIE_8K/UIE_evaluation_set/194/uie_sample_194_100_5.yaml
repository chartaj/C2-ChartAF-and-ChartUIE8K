initial_prompt: I have data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14, specifically celestial
  object measurements. I want a geographic heatmap focusing on the celestial coordinates
  (ra, dec) to visualize the distribution and density of these objects in space. The
  map should highlight areas with high concentrations of objects, differentiated by
  their class (STAR or GALAXY). Additionally, I want to include a color gradient representing
  the redshift values to show how they vary across the map. Include labels for runs
  and camcol to help identify data segments. Ensure the heatmap is interactive, allowing
  tooltips to show detailed data on hover.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap and the redshift
  gradient?

  2. How would you like the class differentiation (STAR or GALAXY) to be represented
  visually? (e.g., different shapes, colors, or icons)

  3. What specific label format do you prefer for the runs and camcol segments?

  4. Do you want any specific titles, subtitles, or axis labels on the heatmap?

  5. Are there any particular grid or scale settings you would like for the celestial
  coordinates (ra, dec)?

  6. Would you prefer a specific range or scale for the redshift values to be emphasized?

  7. How do you want the density of objects to be represented: through color intensity,
  dot density, or another method?

  8. Is there a specific layout or size you prefer for the heatmap (e.g., square,
  rectangular, aspect ratio)?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Different colors would be good.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like the title to be "Celestial Object Distribution and Density," but
  I am not sure about the rest.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Color intensity would work well.

  8. I have no specific preference.
