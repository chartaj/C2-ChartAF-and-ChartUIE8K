initial_prompt: Create an area chart showing the distribution of 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i',
  and 'z' magnitudes across different 'class' labels ('STAR' and 'GALAXY'). Annotate
  specific data points, such as the object with the highest and lowest 'u' magnitude,
  to draw attention to these extremes. Highlight 'GALAXY' data points in a distinct
  color to differentiate them from 'STAR'. This visualization will help to understand
  the magnitude variations in different celestial classifications, useful for space
  and astronomy research. Provide any necessary context or comments to explain the
  chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY''
  data points?

  2. How would you like the annotations for the highest and lowest ''u'' magnitude
  to be displayed (e.g., tooltip, label next to the point, etc.)?

  3. Would you like a legend included in the chart? If so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Is there a preferred layout or style for the axis labels and title (e.g., font
  size, font type)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or dimensions of the chart?

  6. Should there be grid lines in the chart background? If so, should they be light
  or dark?

  7. Are there any additional data points or thresholds you would like to highlight
  or annotate in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Label next to the point.

  3. Yes, I would like a legend included, but I do not know where it should be positioned.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the layout or style of the axis labels
  and title.

  5. I am not sure about the size or dimensions of the chart.

  6. Yes, there should be grid lines in the chart background. I prefer them to be
  light.

  7. I do not know.'
