initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14
  data to visualize the distribution of the 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', and 'z' magnitudes.
  Make sure each box represents one of these magnitude columns, and display their
  ranges, medians, and outliers. This is for an astronomy project exploring star and
  galaxy characteristics in different bands.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences on the color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer the boxes to have specific width or spacing between them?

  4. Would you like to include labels for the median, quartiles, or specific data
  points?

  5. Should the chart title and axis titles be in a specific format or style?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to specify what each box represents?

  7. Are there any specific outlier markers or symbols you prefer to use?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or comments to specific parts of the chart?

  9. Should the axis scales be linear or logarithmic?

  10. Do you want to use different shades or patterns for each magnitude box?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the boxes'' width or spacing.

  4. Yes, please include labels for the median and quartiles.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the format or style of the chart title
  and axis titles.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Linear scales are fine.
