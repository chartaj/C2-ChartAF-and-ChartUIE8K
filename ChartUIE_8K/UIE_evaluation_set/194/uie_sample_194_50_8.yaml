initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the magnitudes
  (u, g, r, i, z) of celestial objects.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display the correlation coefficients directly on the heatmap
  cells?

  3. Should the heatmap have a gradient color scale or categorical color bins?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the x-axis and y-axis labels (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  5. Would you like to include a color legend for the heatmap?

  6. Do you need axis titles or additional annotations on the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines separating the cells?

  8. Are there any specific threshold values you want to highlight in the heatmap?

  9. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  10. Would you like to add any additional context or notes to the heatmap display?'
