initial_prompt: Create a network diagram based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14
  data. Focus on visualizing connections between different celestial objects (stars,
  galaxies) classified in the dataset. Use node size to represent 'redshift' values,
  and edge color to indicate run and camcol similarities. Highlight elements with
  extreme redshift values. Add text annotations for objects with significant redshift
  to highlight key observations. This visualization aims at showcasing spatial relationships
  and helping identify patterns in celestial object classification and distribution.
  The context is space-and-astronomy to enhance understanding of cosmic structures.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the network diagram (e.g., circular,
  hierarchical, force-directed)?

  2. Which color palette would you prefer for representing edge colors based on run
  and camcol similarities?

  3. Are there any specific objects with significant redshift values for which you
  would like more detailed annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size range of the nodes based on redshift values?

  5. Would you like to use any specific shapes for nodes representing different classes
  (e.g., stars and galaxies)?

  6. What level of detail do you prefer for the text annotations (e.g., minimal, moderate,
  or extensive)?

  7. Do you have any particular preferences for the background color or theme of the
  network diagram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like detailed annotations for Quasars with extreme redshift values.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Moderate level of detail for the text annotations.

  7. I do not have any particular preferences.'
