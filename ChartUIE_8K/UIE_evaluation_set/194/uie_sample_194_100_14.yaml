initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 data.
  Plot RA (right ascension) on the x-axis and DEC (declination) on the y-axis to see
  the distribution of celestial objects. Differentiate the points by color based on
  object class (STAR or GALAXY). Also, differentiate the points by size based on the
  'redshift' values to observe their distances. Include a legend for clarity, and
  ensure the plot is titled and axis labels are present. This visualization will help
  in understanding the spatial distribution and classification of the observed celestial
  objects.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  the object classes (STAR or GALAXY)?

  2. Do you prefer any particular size range or scaling method for representing the
  ''redshift'' values?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the scatter plot?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for the title and axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you want to include
  on the plot?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines or any other background elements in the scatter
  plot?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio of the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer the legend to be positioned in the upper right corner.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the style or format for the title and
  axis labels.

  5. No, I do not have any specific annotations or additional information.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference for the aspect ratio of the scatter plot.'
