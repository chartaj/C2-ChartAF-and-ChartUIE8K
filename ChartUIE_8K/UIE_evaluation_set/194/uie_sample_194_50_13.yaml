initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', 'z' magnitudes
  for 'class' categories (STAR, GALAXY) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  magnitudes and classes?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the layout of the chart (horizontal or
  vertical bars)?

  3. Would you like each class (STAR, GALAXY) to be grouped together within each magnitude,
  or each magnitude to be grouped together within each class?

  4. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the chart, axes, or
  legend?

  5. Do you want the magnitudes (''u'', ''g'', ''r'', ''i'', ''z'') to be ordered
  in a specific way on the x-axis?

  6. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart?

  8. Should the chart include any specific annotations or reference lines to highlight
  certain values or categories?

  9. Do you want the bars to display the exact numerical values on top of them?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you prefer for the chartâ€™s
  size?'
