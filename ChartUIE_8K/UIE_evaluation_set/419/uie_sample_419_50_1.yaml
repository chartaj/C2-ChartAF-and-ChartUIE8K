initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart showing bike and pedestrian counts over time
  at different crossings and directions. Highlight important spikes. Include data-driven
  annotations for standout points to emphasize specific trends and focus.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubble chart?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled?

  3. Are there specific time intervals you want on the x-axis (e.g., hours, days,
  weeks, months)?

  4. Do you want separate bubbles for bike counts and pedestrian counts, or should
  they be combined?

  5. Should the size of the bubbles represent absolute counts or proportional sizes
  relative to the maximum count?

  6. Are there specific crossings or directions you want to focus on or exclude from
  the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred format for the data-driven annotations?

  8. How would you like the standout points to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  larger size, bold outline)?

  9. Do you want a legend to differentiate between different crossings or directions?

  10. Any specific trend lines or overlays you would like to be included in the chart?'
