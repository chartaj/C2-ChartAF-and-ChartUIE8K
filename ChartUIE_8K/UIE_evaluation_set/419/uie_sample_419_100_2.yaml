initial_prompt: Let's create a scatter plot that visualizes bike and pedestrian counts
  over time for the Broadway Cycle Track. Annotate peak hours and highlight any significant
  variations in counts. This will help in understanding usage patterns and optimizing
  traffic flow for cyclists and pedestrians. Use different colors to distinguish between
  bike and ped counts, and make sure to highlight peak times using sized or colored
  markers. Since there's a substantial number of missing values, use text annotations
  to indicate periods with missing data, providing context for urban planning in Seattle.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for distinguishing between bike
  counts and pedestrian counts?

  2. What specific time intervals would you like to consider for highlighting peak
  hours (e.g., morning rush hour, evening rush hour)?

  3. How would you prefer the peak times to be highlightedâ€”by using sized markers,
  colored markers, or both?

  4. Should the annotations for missing data be placed at specific points or should
  they cover a range?

  5. Do you have any preference for the size and style of the text annotations indicating
  periods with missing data?

  6. Would you prefer a specific format for the date on the x-axis (e.g., hourly,
  daily, weekly)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Morning rush hour and evening rush hour.

  3. Both sized and colored markers.

  4. The annotations for missing data should cover a range.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Hourly.'
