initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart visualizing bike and pedestrian counts over
  time from the "Riding the Green Wave in Seattle" dataset. Use the 'date' on the
  x-axis and two separate lines for 'bike_count' and 'ped_count' on the y-axis. Could
  you differentiate between the 'bike_count' and 'ped_count' with distinct colors?
  I want to observe the differences in bike and pedestrian traffic patterns over the
  recorded period. Please ensure that timestamps are properly formatted and missing
  values are handled appropriately. The crossing locations and directions might also
  affect the count variations, so could these be referenced too? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating ''bike_count''
  and ''ped_count'' lines?

  2. Would you like to see separate line charts for different ''crossing'' locations
  and ''direction'', or combined into a single chart?

  3. How would you prefer missing values to be handled: filled in, interpolated, or
  left as gaps?

  4. Do you have any specific date format preferences for the x-axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) you''d like
  the x-axis to be segmented into?

  6. Do you want trend lines or additional markers to highlight significant points
  on the chart?

  7. Any preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included to differentiate between the variables,
  and if so, where should it be placed on the chart?'
