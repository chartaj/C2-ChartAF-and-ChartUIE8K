initial_prompt: I want to visualize bike and pedestrian traffic on Broadway Cycle
  Track over time. Create a column chart showing bike_count and ped_count data across
  different hours of the day for various dates. Include date on the x-axis, bike_count
  and ped_count on the y-axis, and different colors for each category. The data should
  be grouped hourly. The focus should be on seeing trends in bike and pedestrian traffic.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easy to understand. Title the chart "Bike and Pedestrian
  Traffic on Broadway Cycle Track" and label all relevant axes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to differentiate between
  bike_count and ped_count?

  2. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  3. Should we display data labels on each column to show the exact count values?

  4. Would you like any gridlines on the chart, and if so, on which axis (x, y, or
  both)?

  5. Do you have a specific date range youâ€™d like to focus on within the data?

  6. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the date labels on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where should it be
  positioned?

  8. Is there any particular aspect of the chart you would like to emphasize, such
  as peak hours or significant changes in traffic?'

  be helpful.

  x-axis.
