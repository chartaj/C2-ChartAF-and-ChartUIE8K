initial_prompt: Create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of bike counts
  and pedestrian counts over time from the Seattle dataset titled "Riding the Green
  Wave in Seattle." The x-axis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should represent
  the count frequencies. Make sure to differentiate between the counts of bikes and
  pedestrians, perhaps using different colors or bar styles. This will help in understanding
  how biking and pedestrian traffic vary at different times at Broadway Cycle Track
  North Of E Union St. Additionally, handle missing data appropriately in the visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating bike counts
  and pedestrian counts?

  2. Would you like the histogram bars to be stacked or side-by-side for comparison?

  3. How would you like missing data to be represented or handled in the chart?

  4. Are there specific date ranges you are particularly interested in highlighting?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or labels to emphasize specific data
  points or trends?

  6. Do you have a preferred style or format for the x-axis date labels (e.g., monthly,
  weekly, daily)?

  7. Would you like any additional grid lines or markers to aid in reading the chart?

  8. Should we include a legend to differentiate between bike and pedestrian counts,
  and if so, where would you like it positioned?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Side-by-side for comparison.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include a legend, and position it at the top right.'
