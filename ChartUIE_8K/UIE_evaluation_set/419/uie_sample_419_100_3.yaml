initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart to visualize bike and pedestrian counts
  over time at various crossings in Seattle. Use the data from '419.csv' where columns
  include date, crossing, direction, bike_count, and ped_count. I want to see the
  bike and pedestrian counts on the y-axis and the timeline on the x-axis. The chart
  should differentiate between bike counts and pedestrian counts with different colors,
  and stack them to show the total count at each time point. Title it "Seattle's Daily
  Bike and Pedestrian Traffic Trends." This is for an urban-planning project on enhancing
  green commuting paths.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate
  between bike counts and pedestrian counts?

  2. Would you like to see any specific time intervals on the x-axis (e.g., daily,
  weekly, monthly)?

  3. Are there any particular crossings you want to highlight or focus on in the visualization?

  4. Do you have any preferences on the appearance of the legend (e.g., its position
  on the chart)?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for significant dates or
  events?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the title and labels on
  the chart?'
