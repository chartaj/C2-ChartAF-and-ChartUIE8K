initial_prompt: I want to visualize bike and pedestrian traffic data across different
  Seattle crossings using a choropleth map. Use '../Extra_datas/data/419.csv' for
  the analysis. Show each crossing's geographic location with color-coded gradients
  representing bike count and pedestrian count. Differentiate between directions to
  see variations in traffic flow. The map should highlight where intervention for
  better traffic management is needed. It's crucial to handle missing values and ensure
  data accuracy. The visualization should ideally cover the entire time range to show
  trends across different periods. Include a user-friendly legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the color gradients for bike and pedestrian counts be distinct from each
  other?

  3. How would you like to handle the differentiation between directions on the map?
  (e.g., using different shades, patterns)

  4. Do you have a preferred method for handling and displaying missing values in
  the data set?

  5. Would you like the map to include any specific geographic boundaries or markers
  such as popular landmarks?

  6. Are there particular time periods you want to be highlighted or compared within
  the map?

  7. Do you prefer a certain type of user-friendly legend, such as gradient bars or
  categorized labels?

  8. Should the visualization include any annotations or callouts for areas with significantly
  high or low traffic?

  9. Is there any specific way you would like trends over time to be represented on
  the map?

  10. Would you like to include any additional data layers, such as public transportation
  routes or traffic density data, to complement the traffic data?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the color gradients for bike and pedestrian counts should be distinct from
  each other.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I would prefer missing values to be represented in a neutral color or pattern.

  5. I do not have any specific preference for geographic boundaries or markers.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Categorized labels would be nice.

  8. Yes, please include annotations or callouts for areas with significantly high
  or low traffic.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
