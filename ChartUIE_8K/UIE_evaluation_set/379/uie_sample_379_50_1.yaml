initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the average sepal and petal lengths across
  different species. Highlight significant differences between species and add annotations
  to emphasize unique findings. This visual aims to clarify how flower dimensions
  vary among species, aiding biological research.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bar chart to represent different
  species?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked?

  3. Do you have a preferred font size or style for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines?

  5. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars?

  6. How would you like the significant differences between species to be highlighted
  (e.g., different colors, patterns, or outlines)?

  7. Are there any specific metrics you want included in the annotations (e.g., mean
  values, standard deviations)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the placement of annotations on the chart?

  9. Would you like to include error bars to show variability within each species?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I prefer vertical bars.

  6. Different colors would be great.

  7. Mean values would be helpful.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.'
