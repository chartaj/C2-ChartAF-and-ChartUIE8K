initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to showcase the distribution of sepal and
  petal lengths separately for each species in the provided dataset. Each histogram
  should have separate sections for Sepal_Length and Petal_Length, and the x-axis
  should display the length measurements while the y-axis should show the frequency
  of occurrences. Ensure that each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica) is represented
  with a distinct color or shading pattern within the histograms for clear differentiation.
  This will help visualize the variance in lengths across different species. No missing
  values, and data types are accurate for your calculation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the distinct species?

  2. Do you have any preference for the bin size for the histograms?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis scales be consistent across all histograms?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the charts for better readability?

  5. Do you have a specific title in mind for each histogram?

  6. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?

  7. Should there be legends indicating the species in each histogram?

  8. Do you prefer any specific layout arrangement for the histograms (e.g., side
  by side or stacked vertically)?

  9. Are there any axis labels or units you want to be specified on the histograms?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I do not have any preference for the bin size.

  3. I am not sure if x-axis and y-axis scales should be consistent.

  4. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  5. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  6. I have no specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  7. Yes, please include legends indicating the species.

  8. I do not know about the layout arrangement.

  9. Yes, please include axis labels and units on the histograms.'
