initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the Sepal and Petal Length distributions
  by Species. Use the provided data to focus on the average lengths for each species.
  Highlight the Species categories using different colors to distinguish them easily.
  Add text annotations for the average Sepal and Petal Length values to emphasize
  the differences among species. Ensure the chart clearly displays the biological
  context and purpose, making it easy for viewers to compare the sepal and petal lengths
  across different species. This visualization will be useful for understanding species-specific
  traits in a biological study.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing the species
  categories?

  2. What font size and style do you prefer for the text annotations displaying the
  average lengths?

  3. Are there specific labels or captions you would like to include on the chart?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability? If so, do you prefer
  horizontal, vertical, or both?

  5. Would you like the chart to have any specific dimensions (height and width)?

  6. Is there a preferred arrangement or ordering of the species categories on the
  x-axis?

  7. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scaling to better display the differences
  in lengths?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines on the chart. Both horizontal and vertical would
  be good.

  5. I do not have specific dimensions in mind.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
