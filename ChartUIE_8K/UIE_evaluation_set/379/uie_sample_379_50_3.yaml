initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize Sepal and Petal length distribution
  by Species from the provided dataset. Use the Sepal_Length, Sepal_Width, Petal_Length,
  and Petal_Width columns. Make sure to differentiate the species clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for differentiating the species?

  2. Would you like to display exact values of Sepal and Petal lengths on the treemap?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout for the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  4. Is there a particular font or size you would like for the labels?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or additional data points you would like to
  highlight?

  6. Do you have preferences for the color palette (e.g., specific colors, gradients)?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the colors used for each
  species?'
