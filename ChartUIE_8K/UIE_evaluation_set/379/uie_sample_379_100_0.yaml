initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of Sepal Length
  and Petal Length by Species. Ensure to include text annotations for some specific
  data points that highlight their values, drawing attention to notable differences
  or outliers. Use highlights to differentiate between species, making each species
  visually distinct. The chart should help viewers quickly grasp the variation in
  sepal and petal dimensions across different species of flowers. The visualization
  should serve as a tool for understanding how these attributes are distributed within
  and across the species. Include relevant descriptive annotations for additional
  context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to differentiate between
  species?

  2. Would you like the box plots to include additional statistical summaries such
  as means or medians?

  3. Are there specific data points you want to ensure are annotated?

  4. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different marker shapes,
  colors)?

  5. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical box plots?

  6. Should grid lines be included to enhance readability?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for text annotations (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend for species differentiation?

  9. Do you want the axis titles and labels to be formatted in a specific way?

  10. Are there any additional descriptive annotations you want to include for context?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Different marker shapes would be good.

  5. I prefer vertical box plots.

  6. Yes, include grid lines to enhance readability.

  7. I have no specific preference for text annotations.

  8. Yes, please include a legend for species differentiation.

  9. No specific formatting preference for axis titles and labels.

  10. I do not know.'
