initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the global rice production by
  country using "Rice Production (Tons)" data. Highlight countries based on their
  production volumes. Use contrasting color gradients to show different production
  levels for clear differentiation. Include a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the contrasting
  color gradients?

  2. Should we include labels for each country directly on the map or keep it minimalist?

  3. Do you have a particular geographic projection in mind (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  4. How many levels of rice production (categories) do you want to distinguish in
  the color gradient?

  5. Any specific ranges or thresholds for the production levels that you want to
  highlight?

  6. Would you like the map to include additional details such as country borders
  or major cities?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the map (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the legend and other
  text elements?'
