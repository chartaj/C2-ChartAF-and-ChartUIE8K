initial_prompt: Create a box chart to compare Rice Yield (Kg/Hectare) distribution
  across different countries in the Global Rice Production Statistics Dataset. Highlight
  outliers and median values to visualize yield variations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend on the chart?

  3. Should each country have a distinct color, or should they all share the same
  color?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  5. Would you prefer to have country names displayed on the y-axis or x-axis?

  6. Should the chart have labels displaying the exact values of outliers and medians?

  7. Do you want to include a title and axes labels on the chart? If so, please specify
  them.

  8. What should be the scale type for the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the countries to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetically, by median yield, custom order)?

  10. Should any specific countries be highlighted or called out in the chart?'
