initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to compare rice production (in tons),
  rice production per person (kg), and rice yield (kg/hectare) among the sampled countries:
  Chile, Mauritania, and Turkey. Use different colors to distinguish between the different
  metrics. Add text annotations to highlight each country''s total rice production
  and its global rank in rice yield. Also, highlight with contrasting colors the countries
  with the highest and lowest rice yields to emphasize their importance. Ensure the
  chart is easy to read for a quick comparison of these metrics across the countries.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different metrics in
  the grouped bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer any specific colors for the countries with the highest and lowest
  rice yields to highlight them effectively?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or placement of text annotations (e.g.,
  above the bars, within the bars)?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the grouped bar chart (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal bars)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded on the chart?

  7. Is there a specific background color you prefer for the chart?

  8. Do you want a specific title for the chart or should it automatically generate
  from the data?

  9. Do you have a preference for the style or positioning of the legend?

  10. Is there a particular format or decimal place precision you prefer for displaying
  the numeric values on the chart?'
answers: '1. No, I do not have any specific color preferences for different metrics.

  2. I am not sure, please choose colors that effectively highlight the countries
  with the highest and lowest rice yields.

  3. Above the bars would be ideal for the text annotations.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. Vertical bars would be preferred for the grouped bar chart.

  6. I do not know, you can decide based on what looks best.

  7. No specific preference for the background color of the chart.

  8. Automatically generate from the data, please.

  9. I do not have a preference for the style or positioning of the legend.

  10. I do not have a specific preference for the format or decimal place precision
  for displaying numeric values.'
