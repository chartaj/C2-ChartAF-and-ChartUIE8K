initial_prompt: Create a table chart summarizing global rice production. Include columns
  for Country, Rice Production (Tons), Acreage, Yield, and their respective ranks.
  Highlight top producers and annotate countries with the highest yields to emphasize
  their performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting top producers
  and annotating countries with the highest yields?

  2. Would you like any specific symbols or icons to be used for annotations?

  3. How should the ranks be displayed â€” as numbers, with specific formatting, or
  in another style?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout or ordering of columns in the table chart?

  5. Should the data be sorted in any particular order, e.g., by rice production,
  yield, or country name?

  6. Are there any additional legends or keys needed to explain the highlights and
  annotations?

  7. Would you like to include any specific title or caption for the chart?

  8. Should the top producers be highlighted in a specific way, such as bold text,
