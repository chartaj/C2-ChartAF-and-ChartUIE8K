initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the ranking of rice production, acreage,
  and yield from the "Global Rice Production Statistics Dataset." Use the countries
  as the y-axis labels and the ranks as the x-axis. Highlight variations across different
  parameters.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend to indicate the ranking scale?

  3. Would you like to annotate the heatmap cells with the exact ranking values?

  4. Do you prefer a specific ordering of the countries on the y-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by rank)?

  5. Should the heatmap include any specific labels or titles for better clarity?

  6. Do you want to highlight specific countries or regions in the heatmap?

  7. Is there a particular range of ranks you are most interested in highlighting
  (e.g., top 10, bottom 10)?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the heatmap for better
  visual separation?

  9. Should any missing values be explicitly highlighted or marked within the heatmap?'
