initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the Global Rice Production
  Statistics Dataset. The chart should include lines for Rice Production (Tons), Rice
  Acreage (Hectare), and Rice Yield (Kg / Hectare). The x-axis should represent the
  different countries, and the y-axis should represent the respective values. Please
  ensure that the chart is clearly labeled with a legend to distinguish between the
  different lines, and make the data points easy to interpret. The goal is to compare
  rice production, area, and yield across various countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the lines representing ''Rice
  Production (Tons)'', ''Rice Acreage (Hectare)'', and ''Rice Yield (Kg / Hectare)''?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style for the line chart (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted
  lines)?

  3. Should data points be marked with specific symbols (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)
  on the lines?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to include data labels directly on the data points for more clarity?

  6. Do you want to set specific limits or intervals for the y-axis to enhance readability?

  7. Should there be any specific formatting for the x-axis labels, such as rotating
  the country names for better visibility?

  8. Are there any particular countries you want to highlight or differentiate in
  the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)
  within the chart?

  10. Would you like to include grid lines in the background to help with comparing
  values across countries?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  2. I prefer solid lines for the chart.

  3. I am not sure about the symbols for the data points.

  4. I do not have a particular font style and size preference.

  5. Yes, please include data labels directly on the data points for more clarity.

  6. I am not sure about setting specific limits or intervals for the y-axis.

  7. Yes, please rotate the country names on the x-axis for better visibility.

  8. I do not have any specific countries to highlight.

  9. Please position the legend at the top of the chart.

  10. Yes, include grid lines in the background to help with comparing values across
  countries.'
