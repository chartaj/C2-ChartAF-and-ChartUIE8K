initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the distances between different cities
  in Russia. Use the "Order" column for the x-axis to represent the start location,
  and the "Distance" column for the y-axis to show the distances. Color code the lines
  based on the "Destination" column to distinguish between different routes. This
  will help analyze the transportation and logistics patterns across these cities.
  Ensure the chart clearly shows trends and variations in distances to aid in logistical
  planning. Include legends and labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color-coding of different
  routes?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to be sorted in any particular way (e.g., alphabetically,
  by distance)?

  3. How would you prefer the lines to be styled (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  4. Are there specific cities or routes you would like to highlight in the chart?

  5. What level of granularity do you want for the labels on the axes (e.g., every
  city, every nth city)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers to be included for certain
  data points?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds or benchmarks you would like indicated in the
  chart?

  9. Do you require grid lines in the chart, and if so, should they be for both axes
  or just one?'
