initial_prompt: I need a column chart for the "Russian Cities Distance Dataset" under
  the transportation-and-logistics category. The chart should display the "Destination"
  on the x-axis and "Distance" on the y-axis. Each bar should represent the distance
  between cities as provided in the dataset. Ensure that each destination city has
  a corresponding distance value clearly shown. This chart will help visualize the
  travel distances between various Russian cities. Please include all unique destinations
  from the dataset. Provide a legend if necessary for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars and the background?

  2. Would you like the distances to be labeled on top of each bar?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines on the y-axis for better readability?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference for the axis labels and titles?

  5. How would you like the legend to be displayed if necessary?

  6. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the y-axis (e.g., increments,
  starting point)?

  7. Would you prefer the chart to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  8. Should the chart title include any specific text or formatting elements?

  9. Do you want to include any additional annotations or notes within the chart?'
