initial_prompt: I have a dataset on the distances between various Russian cities used
  for transportation and logistics planning. I'd like to visualize this data using
  a violin plot to show the distribution of distances between different pairs of cities.
  Please generate a violin plot where each city's name or unique identifier is on
  the x-axis, and the y-axis represents the distances. This will help me see the spread
  and density of distances for each city pairing. Ensure that the chart properly highlights
  any outliers or clusters in the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the violin plot?

  2. Would you like the city names or unique identifiers to be displayed in a specific
  font or size?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you want to display the actual data points on the violin plot?

  5. Are there any specific outlier markers you prefer?

  6. Do you want a legend to differentiate between different cities or city pairs?

  7. Should the y-axis have a specific scale or range, such as starting from zero?

  8. Do you prefer a particular background color for the chart?

  9. Would you like to add any labels or titles to the axes and the chart itself?

  10. Is there any specific format or order for sorting the city names on the x-axis?'
