initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distance data between various
  destinations in the Russian Cities Distance Dataset. Highlight outliers in the distance
  data to draw attention to unusual travel lengths. Use text annotations to show the
  median, quartiles, and any noteworthy outliers, if applicable. The goal of this
  visualization is to understand distance distribution and identify any anomalies
  or patterns. This is useful for logistics and transportation planning within the
  specified cities. The highlights and annotations will help in emphasizing crucial
  data points for better decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for highlighting outliers?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  3. Is there a particular way you want the quartiles and median to be represented
  (e.g., specific symbols or lines)?

  4. Should the chart include a title and labels for the axes? If so, do you have
  preferences for the wording?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart? If yes, how would you prefer
  it to be formatted?

  6. Do you have a preference for the layout and orientation of the box plot (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Are there any specific destinations you want to be emphasized or focused on in
  the chart?

  8. Would you like to include additional contextual information or notes on the chart?
  If yes, please specify.'
