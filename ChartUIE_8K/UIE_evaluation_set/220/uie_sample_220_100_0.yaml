initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the distance between various
  Russian cities. Use the dataset columns 'Order', 'Destination', and 'Distance' as
  the basis. Highlight the shortest and longest distances to emphasize the extremes.
  Include data-driven text annotations for the top 5 shortest and longest routes to
  draw attention to these specific routes. The purpose is to analyze the transportation
  efficiency and logistics within these cities, making it easier to identify key patterns
  and outliers. The chart should be practical for logistics planning and transportation
  optimization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display any specific city order (e.g., alphabetical, by distance)?

  3. Would you like the shortest and longest distances to be highlighted using specific
  colors or patterns?

  4. How would you prefer the text annotations for the top 5 shortest and longest
  routes to be formatted (e.g., font size, color, positioning)?

  5. Should there be a particular title or labels for the axes in the heatmap?

  6. Are there any additional labels or legend details you would like included?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be visible on the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the size and aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  9. Should the distances be represented with any specific units or formatting (e.g.,
  kilometers, miles, decimal precision)?'
