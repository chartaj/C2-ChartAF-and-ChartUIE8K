initial_prompt: Create a network diagram to visualize business relationships within
  the company. Use nodes to represent individuals (e.g., company.CEO.JohnSmith) and
  connections to show their imports (e.g., company.CFO.SarahJohnson). Add data-driven
  text annotations to highlight key relationships, such as the CEO’s direct imports.
  Use highlights to emphasize higher-level roles, making them more visually distinct.
  This will help focus on key personnel and their influence within the network. The
  purpose is to easily identify communication patterns and hierarchical structures
  within the company. Ensure all annotations and highlights serve to clarify these
  relationships.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting higher-level
  roles?

  2. Are there specific shapes or sizes you''d prefer for the nodes representing different
  roles?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout style for the network diagram (e.g., circle
  layout, hierarchical layout, force-directed layout)?

  4. Should the text annotations for key relationships be in a specific font style
  or size?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the thickness or style of the connections between
  nodes to represent different types of relationships?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or keys to explain the highlights and annotations
  used in the diagram?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include in the chart to provide
  additional context?

  8. Is there a preferred background color or style for the network diagram?'
