initial_prompt: Create an area chart depicting the global population growth from 1955
  to 2024. Highlight key changes in population and annotate significant yearly changes,
  fertility rates, and median ages to emphasize trends and patterns over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed?

  3. Are there specific years you want the annotations to be highlighted on the chart?

  4. What style of annotations do you prefer (e.g., callouts, text labels, arrows)?
