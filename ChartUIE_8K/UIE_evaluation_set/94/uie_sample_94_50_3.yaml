initial_prompt: Create a column chart that visualizes global population growth from
  1955 to 2024. Show yearly population, yearly percent change, and median age as the

  2. How would you like to differentiate the different metrics (e.g., different colors
  for each metric)?

  type)?

  6. Do you require a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be placed on
  the chart?

  7. Would you like the median age to be represented as a line plot overlaid on the
  column bars?

  8. Should there be grid lines in the background for better readability? If yes,
  in what style (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  9. Would you like to include tooltips that provide more detailed information when
  hovering over each bar?
