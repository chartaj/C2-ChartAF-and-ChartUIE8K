initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the global population distribution
  in 2024, highlighting the age demographics. Annotate specific slices with the median
  age and fertility rate to draw attention to key data points. This visualization
  will emphasize variations in age distribution and fertility rates across different
  sectors of the population. Additionally, provide context on the yearly percentage
  changes and density over the years, as this will help understand population growth
  trends over the past century. Ensure the chart is visually engaging and easy to
  interpret by using distinctive colors and labels.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the pie chart?

  2. Are there specific age demographics you want to highlight more prominently?

  3. What style of label annotations do you prefer for the median age and fertility
  rate (e.g., inside the slices, outside with lines, etc.)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, how detailed should it be?

  5. Is there a specific font or style you prefer for the chart text and labels?

  6. How would you like the yearly percentage changes and density over the years to
  be presented within the context of the pie chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the size or dimensions of the pie chart?

  8. Should any additional elements (like title, subtitle) be included for better
  context?

  9. Are there any specific examples of pie charts you find effective or visually
  appealing that we should take inspiration from?'
answers: '1. I do not know, I have no specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, I would appreciate your recommendation.

  3. Inside the slices would be great for the median age and fertility rate annotations.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful. It should be detailed enough to explain the different
  age demographics.

  5. I am not sure, I have no specific preference for font or style.

  6. I am not sure how this should be presented; please recommend what would work
  best.

  7. I do not know, I have no specific preference for the size or dimensions.

  8. Yes, including a title and subtitle would be helpful for context.

  9. I do not have specific examples in mind, so I would appreciate your expertise
  on what looks effective and visually appealing.'
