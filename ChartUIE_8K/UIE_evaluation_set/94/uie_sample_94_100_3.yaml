initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that visualizes the global population
  data from 1955 to 2024 as provided in the dataset. I want the x-axis to represent
  the years and the y-axis to show the population in billions. Make sure to display
  the yearly population changes and the yearly percentage change. Include the number
  of people in millions on the y-axis, and present the trend clearly to visualize
  the population growth over these years. Please color-code the yearly changes and
  percentage changes for better clarity. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  distinguishing ''yearly changes'' and ''percentage changes''?

  2. Should the years on the x-axis be displayed at specific intervals (e.g., every
  5 years, 10 years) or display every single year?

  3. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the chart (e.g., highlighting
  important years or milestones)?

  4. What level of detail would you prefer for the y-axis labels? Do you want them
  rounded to specific decimal places or in another format?

  5. Are there any specific patterns or trends you want to be highlighted or emphasized
  in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, maybe every 5 years would be good.

  3. I do not know if specific annotations are necessary.

  4. I think it would be best to have the number of people in round millions for better
  understanding.

  5. I am not sure about specific patterns or trends to highlight.'
