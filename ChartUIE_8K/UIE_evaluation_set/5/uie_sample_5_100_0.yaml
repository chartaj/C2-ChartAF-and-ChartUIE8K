initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the state-wise professional
  profiles of suicide victims, using data from 2001. Each bar should be divided by
  gender and age group, with the x-axis representing states/UTs and the y-axis showing
  the total number of suicides. Highlight the age groups where the numbers are significantly
  higher. Add text annotations to display the exact figures for up to three prominent
  professions per state. This will help in understanding the social and professional
  backgrounds most impacted by suicides, assisting in targeted interventions. Highlight
  trends and outliers using annotations for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Should certain age groups be highlighted with specific colors?

  3. Do you want to include a legend distinguishing different genders and age groups?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to appear (e.g., font size, color)?

  5. Is there a specific format you prefer for the exact figures in the text annotations?

  6. Should the bars have specific spacing or width?

  7. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  8. Would you like any gridlines or background shading in the chart for better readability?

  9. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  10. Do you have a preferred method for indicating trends and outliers (e.g., colored
  arrows, circles)?'
