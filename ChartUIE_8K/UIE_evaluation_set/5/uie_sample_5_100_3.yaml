initial_prompt: I want to visualize the statewise professional profile of suicide
  victims using a grouped column chart. Specifically, I want to compare the total
  number of male and female victims across different age groups for various causes
  of suicide in the year 2001. Each group should represent a different cause (such
  as House Wife, Service (Government), Service (Private)), and within each group,
  there should be columns representing the different age categories (Male upto 14
  years, Male 15-29 years, etc.) for both males and females. This will help me understand
  the distribution of suicide victims by profession and age.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be labeled on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to distinguish between male and female victims?
  If so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Should the y-axis show absolute numbers or percentages?

  5. Do you want to display data labels on the columns to show the exact numbers?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the chart for easier interpretation?

  7. Is there a specific order you would like the causes of suicide to be grouped
  in?

  8. Do you want to highlight any specific data points or trends within the chart?

  9. Should there be any annotation or reference lines to indicate significant thresholds
  or milestones?

  10. How would you prefer to handle missing or zero values in the chart?

  11. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, please provide
  the preferred text.'
