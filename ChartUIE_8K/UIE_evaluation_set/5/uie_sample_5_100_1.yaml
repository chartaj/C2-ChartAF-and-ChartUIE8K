initial_prompt: Please create a population pyramid chart visualizing the data on the
  statewise professional profile of suicide victims from the given dataset. Highlight
  key differences in suicide rates across different age groups, genders, and professions
  for each state. Use text annotations to emphasize noteworthy data points, such as
  age groups with highest and lowest suicide rates, differences between male and female
  victims, and any significant trends over the years. The chart should effectively
  illustrate the distribution and profile of suicide victims, aiding in social science
  research and policy-making efforts.

  between genders and age groups?

  5. Should we include a legend explaining the color and age group mappings?

  6. Is there a preferred method for displaying trends over the years (e.g., line

  7. How detailed do you want the text annotations to be? Should they include exact
  values or just highlight trends?

  8. Do you want any specific titles, subtitles, or labels for the chart to enhance
  clarity?

  values?
