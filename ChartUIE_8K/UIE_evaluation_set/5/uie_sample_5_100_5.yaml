initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap that visualizes the professional profile
  of suicide victims across different states and years. I want to see different causes
  of suicide among various age groups for both males and females. Highlight the intensity
  based on the number of incidents. This should help us identify high-risk demographics
  and causes. Include a legend and clear labels for better interpretation. Make sure
  all states, years, causes, and age groups are covered. Thanks!


  '
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used in the heatmap?\
  \ \n2. How many color bins would you like to use to represent different intensities?\n\
  3. Would you prefer a specific arrangement for the age groups (e.g., youngest to\
  \ oldest) in the heatmap?\n4. Do you have a preferred order for the causes of suicide,\
  \ or should they be arranged alphabetically?\n5. Should the heatmap display absolute\
  \ numbers or normalized values (e.g., percentages)?\n6. Are there any specific annotations\
  \ or highlights you would like to include for certain data points?\n7. Do you have\
  \ a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?\n8. Would you like to\
  \ distinguish between male and female data using different color intensities or\
  \ patterns?\n9. Should the heatmap include any particular margin settings for better\
  \ readability?\n10. Would you prefer horizontal, vertical, or square cells for the\
  \ heatmap?"
