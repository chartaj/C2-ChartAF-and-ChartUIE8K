initial_prompt: I'd like to create a pie chart based on the given data to visualize
  the distribution of unique values in the 'name' column. Since the 'name' column
  has 10 unique values, please display each unique value as a separate slice of the
  pie chart along with its proportion. This will help me understand the relative frequency
  of each value in the 'name' column, which in this case reflects yeast genomics data
  categories such as 'MIT'. Please ensure each slice is labeled clearly with the corresponding
  name value. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the slices of the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the slices to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., alphabetical
  or by frequency)?

  3. Do you prefer to have percentage values displayed on each slice, or just the
  name labels?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, or should all information be directly labeled
  on the pie chart?

  5. Would you like to add any additional annotations or insights next to specific
  slices?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the pie chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information in the chart''s subtitle
  or footnotes?

  9. Do you prefer the chart to have 2D or 3D effects?

  10. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the chart''s gridlines or
  background?'
