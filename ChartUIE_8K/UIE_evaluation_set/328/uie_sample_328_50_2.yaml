initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the 'mcg' vs 'gvh' data values.
  Use text annotations for data points in the 'MIT' category, highlighting their 'alm'
  and 'mit' values. The chart should illustrate data distribution in genomics research.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the data points?

  2. How would you like the ''MIT'' category data points to be highlighted (e.g.,
  specific color or marker)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size of the data points?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot?

  6. Should the axes be labeled with specific titles or units?

  7. Do you prefer a particular layout for the chart (e.g., specific aspect ratio,
  margin sizes)?

  8. Is there any specific legend or key that you would like to include?

  9. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the axes scales (e.g., logarithmic
  scale, min/max values)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the ''MIT'' category data points to be highlighted with a specific
  color or marker, maybe red.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, maybe a clear and readable font.

  5. I do not know.

  6. The axes should be labeled with ''mcg'' and ''gvh''.
