initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the yeast.csv data. I would like
  to visualize the trends of the numerical features across different samples. Specifically,
  plot 'mcg', 'gvh', 'alm', 'mit', 'erl', 'pox', 'vac', 'nuc' on the Y-axis and use
  a common identifier (like sample index) on the X-axis. Ensure each line represents
  one of these features. The chart will help us understand the variation among these
  features in yeast strains. Thank you!
questions: "1. What color palette would you prefer for the lines representing each\
  \ feature?\n2. Do you have any preference for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed,\
  \ dotted) for different features?\n3. Would you like to include gridlines for better\
  \ readability? If yes, should they be both horizontal and vertical or only one of\
  \ them?\n4. Is there a specific range or scale for the Y-axis you'd like to set,\
  \ or should it be automatically adjusted based on the data?\n5. Do you want to include\
  \ markers on the lines to highlight individual data points?\n6. Should we add a\
  \ legend to the chart to clearly identify each feature? If yes, where would you\
  \ prefer the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right, or inside\
  \ the chart)?\n7. Do you want to include axis titles and labels? If so, do you have\
  \ any specific text you want for them?\n8. Would you like to display the sample\
  \ index on the X-axis as is, or would you prefer a different identifier? \n9. Do\
  \ you have a title in mind for the chart, or should we generate one based on the\
  \ data and purpose?\n10. Are there any specific font preferences for the chart text\
  \ (title, labels, legend)?"
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include gridlines. I do not have a specific preference for horizontal
  or vertical.

  4. Automatically adjusted based on the data.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please add a legend. I do not have a specific preference for the position.

  7. Yes, please include axis titles and labels. I do not have specific text in mind.

  8. Sample index on the X-axis is fine.

  9. I do not have a specific title in mind, please generate one based on the data
  and purpose.

  10. I do not have any specific font preferences.'
