initial_prompt: Create a box chart for the 'yeast.csv' showing the distribution of
  'mcg', 'gvh', 'alm', and 'mit' columns. This will help visualize the range, interquartile
  range, and potential outliers for these genomics-related features.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like each box to be displayed in a different color for easier differentiation?

  3. Do you have a specific order for displaying the columns (mcg, gvh, alm, mit)
  on the box chart?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to display data points for outliers individually as dots?

  5. Should the whiskers on the box chart extend to the minimum and maximum values
  or to a specific percentile?

  6. Would you like to include notches in the box plots to show the confidence interval
  for the median?

  7. Do you prefer any particular style or format for the axis labels and title?

  8. Do you want to display summary statistics (mean, median, range) on the chart?

  9. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you have in mind for the chart?

  10. Would you like to add any grid lines for better readability of the chart?'
