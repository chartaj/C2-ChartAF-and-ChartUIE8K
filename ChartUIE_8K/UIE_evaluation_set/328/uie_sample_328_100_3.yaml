initial_prompt: I have a yeast dataset with various features like mcg, gvh, alm, etc.
  I need a box plot to explore the distribution of these features. Please create a
  box chart for each feature (mcg, gvh, alm, mit, erl, pox, vac, nuc) to compare their
  spread and identify any outliers. This will help analyze the distribution within
  each feature and any anomalies in the yeast genomic data. Also, label the charts
  clearly with the respective feature names on the axis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box plots?

  2. Would you like to include a title for each box plot?

  3. Should the y-axis of all box plots be standardized to the same scale or customized
  for each feature?

  4. Do you want to highlight outliers in a specific way (e.g., with different colors
  or shapes)?

  5. Is there any specific annotation or annotation style you want to be added to
  the box plots?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the plots for better readability, and if so, should
  they be both horizontal and vertical?

  7. Would you like to include any summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) on the
  box plots?

  8. Should the box plots be displayed individually or combined into a single composite
  chart?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the font type and size for the chart
  labels?'
