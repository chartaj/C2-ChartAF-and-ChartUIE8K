initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the count of banking crises over different
  years for various countries. Use the 'banking_crisis' data to segment bars into
  'crisis' and 'no_crisis'. Include text annotations to highlight specific years with
  systemic crises. Highlight bars representing years with currency crises in a different
  color for emphasis. The goal is to provide a clear visual representation of economic
  stability trends across different countries and years. This will help in understanding
  the frequency and impact of banking crises alongside other economic crises within
  the African context.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for highlighting the bars representing
  different crises (banking crises vs. currency crises)?

  2. Would you like to use specific symbols or styles for text annotations highlighting
  systemic crises?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the bar chart (vertical or
  horizontal)?

  4. How would you prefer the bars to be grouped or stacked (grouped by country or
  stacked by crisis type)?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the text annotations
  and axis labels?

  6. Should there be a legend included in the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for its placement?

  7. Do you need a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  8. Are there any specific years or countries you would like to highlight more prominently?'
