initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the economic conditions over time
  for different countries. Plot "year" on the x-axis and key economic indicators such
  as "inflation_annual_cpi" and "gdp_weighted_default" on the y-axis. Use text annotations
  to highlight significant years with systemic crises or banking crises, focusing
  on instances of high inflation or default rates. Employ visual highlights like color
  changes to differentiate between crisis and non-crisis years. This will help in
  analyzing trends and patterns in economic stability and crises within African countries
  over a historical timeline.
questions: '1. What color scheme or specific colors would you like to use to differentiate
  between crisis and non-crisis years?

  2. Do you have particular preferences for the line styles or markers for the economic
  indicators?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted for significant years
  with systemic crises or banking crises?

  4. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations and axis
  labels?

  5. Are there any specific countries within Africa that you want to focus on more
  prominently in the chart?

  6. How would you like to handle overlapping text annotations if multiple significant
  events occur in the same year?

  7. Do you have any preferences on the size or dimensions of the chart?

  8. Are there specific thresholds for inflation or default rates that should trigger
  a visual highlight?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the text annotations to be clear and concise, maybe with a small

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not know.
