initial_prompt: 'I''m working on visualizing African economic and banking crisis data.
  Please create a pie chart showing the distribution of the different types of crises
  (systemic_crisis, currency_crises, inflation_crises, banking_crisis) across the
  dataset. I need the chart to clearly indicate the proportion of each crisis type
  relative to the total occurrences. Use the provided data to ensure accuracy in representing
  how often each type of crisis happens. This will help in understanding which crisis
  is most frequent in African countries over time. Thank you!

  '
questions: '1. What colors do you prefer for each type of crisis in the pie chart?

  2. Do you want the pie chart to include percentage labels for each slice?

  3. Should the pie chart have a legend to identify each type of crisis, or do you
  prefer labels directly on the slices?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you want any specific titles or subtitles for the pie chart?

  6. Is there a particular order in which you want the slices arranged (e.g., from
  most to least frequent)?

  7. Should the chart include any additional annotations or explanations for clarity?'
