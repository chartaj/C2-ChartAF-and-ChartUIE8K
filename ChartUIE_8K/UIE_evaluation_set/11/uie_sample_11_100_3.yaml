initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for the in-vehicle coupon recommendation
  dataset. Plot the age groups on the x-axis and the percentage of coupons accepted
  on the y-axis. Differentiate the lines based on the income levels. For each income
  level, show how the acceptance rate varies across the age groups. The chart should
  help understand the pattern of coupon acceptance based on age and income levels
  when people are in their vehicles.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing different income levels?

  2. Are there any particular age group intervals that you would prefer for the x-axis?

  3. Would you like to include data markers for each data point on the lines, or should
  the lines be smooth without markers?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain which lines correspond to which
  income levels?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the range or scale of the y-axis to show the
  percentage of coupons accepted?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability of the
  data?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you want for the chart, x-axis, and y-axis?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or data labels on specific data points?

  9. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text elements in
  the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or a footnote on the chart
  to provide more context to the audience?'
