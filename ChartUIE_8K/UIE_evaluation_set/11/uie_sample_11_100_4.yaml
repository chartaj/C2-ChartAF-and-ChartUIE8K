initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that shows the count of each unique destination
  in the in-vehicle coupon recommendation dataset. Each bar should represent a different
  destination category, and the height should reflect how many entries fall into each
  category. Also, color-code the bars based on the weather conditions to add an extra
  layer of information. This will help visualize how different destinations relate
  to various weather conditions in this set of data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the weather conditions?

  2. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending
  order)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  4. Would you like to include a legend indicating the weather conditions?

  5. Should the chart include data labels showing the count of entries for each bar?

  6. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Would you like to add any gridlines to the chart for easier reading of bar heights?

  8. Should the chart include any specific title or subtitle?

  to highlight or annotate in the chart?'
