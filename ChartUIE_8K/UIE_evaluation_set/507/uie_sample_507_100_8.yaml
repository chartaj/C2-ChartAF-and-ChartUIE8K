initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the election results for the top three
  constituencies. The x-axis will represent the different political parties (CON,
  LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, NAT, MIN, OTH), and the y-axis will represent the number
  of votes each party received. Use different colored dots to differentiate each constituency
  (Aldershot, Aldridge-Brownhills, Altrincham and Sale West). Add a legend to indicate
  which color corresponds to which constituency. Ensure the plot is clear and each
  dot is easily distinguishable. Title the chart "Election Results for Top 3 Constituencies."
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the dots representing
  each constituency?

  2. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for reference?

  4. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Should the dots have a specific size or shape to make them more distinguishable?

  6. Do you want any annotations or data labels on the chart to highlight specific
  values?

  7. Are there any specific visual themes or styles you would like to be applied to
  the chart?

  8. Do you need any margin or padding adjustments around the chart for better layout
  fitting?'
