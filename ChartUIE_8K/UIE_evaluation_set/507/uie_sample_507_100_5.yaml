initial_prompt: Create a radar chart comparing the performance of the political parties
  (CON, LAB, LIB, Green) across the sample constituencies (Aldershot, Aldridge-Brownhills,
  Altrincham and Sale West). Use the percentage columns (CON(%), LAB(%), LIB(%), Green(%))
  for each constituency to visualize their relative strengths. Include all four constituencies
  and their respective percentages to show how each party fares in different regions.
  This will help analyze the distribution and popularity of each political party visually
  and comprehensively within the specified areas. Ensure the chart is clear and labeled
  accurately for better understanding.
