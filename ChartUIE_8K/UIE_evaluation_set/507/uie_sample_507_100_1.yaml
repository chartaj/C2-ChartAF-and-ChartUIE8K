initial_prompt: Create a column chart comparing the percentage of votes (CON(%), LAB(%),
  LIB(%), Green(%)) across different constituencies. Each bar should represent a different
  party's vote percentage with distinct colors to highlight differences. Add text
  annotations showing exact percentage values on each bar for clarity. Highlight the
  winning party for each constituency using bold or a different color outline to emphasize
  their importance. This visualization will help us quickly discern which party won
  and the vote distribution among parties in each area. Keep the chart clean and easy
  to read for insightful analysis of the election results.
