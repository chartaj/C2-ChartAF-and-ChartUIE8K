initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the dataset to visualize the percentage values
  of different political parties across constituencies for the given elections. Highlight
  the highest CON(%) values in each row with a different color to emphasize areas
  of strong Conservative support. Add annotations to show the exact percentage values
  for CON(%), LAB(%), and LIB(%) for selected constituencies with significant variations.
  This will help in quickly identifying strongholds and competitive regions. Keep
  the constituency names as labels on the y-axis and percentage types on the x-axis
  to enhance data interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap, especially
  for highlighting the highest CON(%) values?

  2. Would you like to specify which constituencies to annotate, or should they be
  selected based on significant variations automatically?

  3. Are there any particular font sizes or styles you prefer for the annotations
  and labels?

  4. Do you prefer a particular ordering for the constituencies on the y-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by percentage values)?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the colors used?

  6. Are there any specific grid lines or borders you would like to include or exclude
  in the heatmap for better clarity?'
