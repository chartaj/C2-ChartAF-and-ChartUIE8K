initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart comparing the vote percentages for
  each party (CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, NAT, MIN, OTH) for the three constituencies
  provided (Aldershot, Aldridge-Brownhills, Altrincham and Sale West). Each constituency
  should be a separate group of bars, with different colored bars representing each
  party's percentage within that group. Make sure to include a legend to differentiate
  the parties and label both axes appropriately (constituencies on the x-axis and
  percentage on the y-axis). Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party in the bar
  chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be ordered in any specific sequence for each constituency,
  such as by vote percentage or party name?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Is there a preferred width or spacing for the bars within each group?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales you would like to use for the y-axis
  (percentage axis)?

  6. Would you like to display the exact vote percentage values on top of each bar?

  7. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include on
  the chart?'
