initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of electorate
  sizes across different constituencies. Use the 'Name' column for the x-axis and
  the 'Electorate' column for the y-axis. The chart should highlight the variation
  in the number of voters in each constituency. Note, we need the bars to be clearly
  color-coded for easy differentiation between constituencies. This will help in identifying
  which areas have a larger or smaller electorate base.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for easier comparison of bar heights?

  3. Should the bar labels display the exact electorate number on top?

  4. What title would you like for the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or highlights for certain constituencies?

  7. Should the x-axis labels be rotated to fit better if there are many constituencies?

  8. Do you require a legend explaining the color coding used for the bars?

  9. Is there a specific order you''d like the constituencies to be presented in (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by size)?'
