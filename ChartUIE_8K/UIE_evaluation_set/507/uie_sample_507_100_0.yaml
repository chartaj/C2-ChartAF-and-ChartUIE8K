initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the election results by
  constituency, focusing on the percentage of votes each party received. Each column
  should represent a constituency and be divided into segments for each party (CON(%),
  LAB(%), LIB(%), etc.). Use different colors for each party's segment. Additionally,
  apply text annotations to display exact percentages on top of each segment. Highlight
  the winning party in each constituency by making its segment more prominent (e.g.,
  bold or thicker border). This visualization helps quickly compare party performance
  and identify winners across constituencies.
