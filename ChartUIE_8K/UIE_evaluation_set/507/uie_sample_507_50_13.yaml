initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the percentage of votes (Y-axis) for
  each party (X-axis) across different constituencies. Highlight winners distinctly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between different
  parties?

  2. How would you like the winners to be highlighted (e.g., different marker shape,
  size, or color)?

  3. Should there be a legend to explain the color coding and markers used?

  4. Do you prefer any specific axes ranges for the scatter plot?

  5. Would you like to include labels for each data point?

  6. Are there any specific titles or labels you want for the X-axis, Y-axis, and
  the scatter plot itself?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines to be displayed in the scatter plot for better readability?'
answers: I am not sure. For the winners, highlighting them with a different marker
  shape sounds good. Yes, a legend explaining the color coding and markers would be
  helpful. I do not have any specific preference regarding axes ranges.
