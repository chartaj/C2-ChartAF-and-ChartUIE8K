initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap that shows the percentage of votes
  each political party received across different areas. Use the 'Area' data along
  with the percentage columns ('CON(%)', 'LAB(%)', 'LIB(%)', 'Brexit(%)', 'Green(%)',
  'NAT(%)', 'MIN(%)', 'OTH(%)'). Highlight areas by the political party with the highest
  percentage of votes. Each area should be easily distinguishable on the map, and
  there should be a legend to indicate which color represents which party. This will
  help visualize regional voting patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each political party?

  2. Are there any particular geographic regions you want to emphasize?

  3. What level of granularity would you prefer for the geographic areas (e.g., town,
  city, district)?

  4. Would you like to include any annotations or labels on the map?

  5. Is there a particular map projection you prefer?

  6. Do you have a preference for the map''s background style (e.g., plain, terrain,
  satellite)?

  7. Should the legend be placed at a specific part of the map (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  8. Do you want to display the exact percentage values on the map?

  9. Are there any additional layers or contextual information you would like to overlay
  on the map?'
