initial_prompt: Create a treemap representing the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset. Use different sizes and colors to highlight the key nutritional components
  like calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates across various food items. Include
  text annotations for food names and key nutritional values to draw attention to
  high and low nutrient foods. Use highlights to emphasize foods with exceptionally
  high or low values in any nutrient category. This visualization will help users
  quickly understand and compare the nutritional content of a diverse range of Indonesian
  foods.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific color schemes to represent different
  nutritional components like calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates?

  2. Are there any specific font styles or sizes that you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Should the foods with exceptionally high or low nutrient values be highlighted
  with specific colors or markers?

  4. Do you want to include images of the food items within the treemap nodes?

  5. How would you like the nutritional values to be displayed in the text annotations
  (e.g., in grams, percentages)?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the treemap?

  7. Are there specific threshold values for nutrients that you want to use to classify
  foods as "high" or "low" in those nutrients?

  8. Would you like to group similar food items together in the treemap for easier
  comparison?'
