initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the nutritional content of various Indonesian
  foods and drinks. Use the dataset "Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition Dataset."
  The columns to include in the heatmap are 'calories', 'proteins', 'fat', and 'carbohydrate'.
  Each food item's nutritional values should be displayed on the heatmap to compare
  their nutritional density. Label the axes with food names and the nutritional contents.
  Ensure the heatmap has a gradient color scheme to indicate the intensity of the
  nutritional values. Provide a legend to explain the color gradients for better understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred color gradients or color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the labels on the axes and the
  legend?

  3. Should any specific foods or nutritional content be highlighted or emphasized
  in the heatmap?

  4. Do you have preferences regarding the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  horizontal vs. vertical)?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the food items (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on nutritional values)?

  7. Is there a particular design style you would like the heatmap to follow (e.g.,
  modern, minimalist)?'
