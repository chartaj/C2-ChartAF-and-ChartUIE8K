initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset. Plot 'calories' on the x-axis and 'proteins' on the y-axis. Highlight data
  points with visually distinguishing markers for high-calorie and high-protein foods.
  Add annotations to emphasize foods that are both high in calories and proteins.
  Ensure the chart is easy to understand and interpret, providing a reference for
  nutritional content. The chart should help users quickly identify which foods are
  rich in calories and proteins. This visualization serves to enhance nutritional
  awareness quickly.
