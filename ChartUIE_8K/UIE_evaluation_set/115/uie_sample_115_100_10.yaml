initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize nutritional content of Indonesian
  foods. Use the dataset to compare calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates for
  samples like Abon, Abon haruwan, and Agar-agar. Include all these metrics on different
  axes for each food item. Ensure each axis is properly labeled with its respective
  nutrient type and the values accurately reflect the dataset. The chart should visually
  represent how each food item differs in their nutritional makeup, making it easy
  to compare their profiles at a glance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different food items
  in the radar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend indicating which color represents
  which food item?

  3. Do you prefer specific shapes or markers on the radar chart axes for visual differentiation?

  4. What is your preference for the scales on each axis? Should they be uniform or
  different based on the range of each nutrient?

  5. Would you like to highlight any specific data points or nutrient values in the
  chart?

  6. How detailed would you like the axis labels to be (e.g., just the nutrient names
  or with additional information)?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or sizes you prefer for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or comments on the chart to provide context
  or insights?'
