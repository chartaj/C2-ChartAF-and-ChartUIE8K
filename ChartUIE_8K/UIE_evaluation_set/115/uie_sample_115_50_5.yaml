initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap showing the correlation between calories,
  proteins, fat, and carbohydrates in the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition Dataset.
  Use distinct colors to represent different levels of correlation.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences or a color palette you would
  like to use for representing different levels of correlation?

  2. What range of correlation coefficients (e.g., -1 to 1) do you want to highlight
  with distinct colors?

  3. Would you like to include labels displaying the correlation coefficient values
  within each cell of the heatmap?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme (e.g., sequential, divergent)
  to represent positive and negative correlations distinctly?

  5. How would you like the axis labels (e.g., ''calories'', ''proteins'', ''fat'',
  ''carbohydrate'') to be displayed? (e.g., font size, orientation)

  6. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to include on the
  heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preferred background color for the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to show a color bar legend to indicate the correlation levels?
  If yes, do you have any preferences for its position and layout?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include labels displaying the correlation coefficient values within
  each cell.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. No, I do not have any specific titles or annotations.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, I would like to show a color bar legend to indicate the correlation levels,
  but I have no preference for its position and layout.'
