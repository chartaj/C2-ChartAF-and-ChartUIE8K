initial_prompt: 'I would like a radar chart that visualizes various aspects of automobile
  performance and specifications. Please use data from the file "../Extra_datas/data/449.csv."
  Include the following columns in the chart: "0-60 mph (sec)," "Gas Mileage (mpg),"
  "Power (kW)," "Weight (kg)," and "Engine Displacement (cc)." This will help to easily
  compare these attributes across different vehicles. The chart should be clear and
  labeled for easy interpretation. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or theme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled (specific titles, units, font size)?
