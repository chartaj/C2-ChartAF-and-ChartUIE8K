initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the automobile data with annotations
  to highlight key points. The chart should have 5 bars representing "0-60 mph(sec)",
  "Gas Mileage(mpg)", "Power(kW)", "Weight(kg)", and "Engine Displacement(cc)". Use
  annotations to display values on each bar and highlight the "0-60 mph(sec)" and
  "Power(kW)" for emphasis. This will help compare and understand how these metrics
  differ among various cars. Ensure the chart is clear and informative for a quick
  analysis of the given data.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars in the chart?

  2. How would you like the annotations to be styled (font size, color, etc.)?

  3. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending,
  descending)?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference for the labels and annotations?

  5. Would you like the bars to have a specific width or spacing between them?

  6. Should there be any particular gridlines or background elements in the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a legend in the chart? If so, where should it be placed?

  8. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want on the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred style for emphasizing the "0-60 mph(sec)" and "Power(kW)"
  bars?

  10. Would you like to include any additional text or notes on the chart to provide
  context?'
