initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between Engine Displacement,
  Gas Mileage, Power, Weight, and 0-60 mph times for various automobiles. Use color
  intensities to highlight stronger correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the correlation
  strengths in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to follow a specific gradient (e.g., from
  blue to red, or from light to dark)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the axes or the cells in the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include numerical correlation values in each cell?

  5. Are there any particular annotations or markers you would like to add to the
  heatmap to emphasize certain correlations?

  6. Do you have preferences regarding the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  square vs. rectangular)?

  7. Should there be any specific ranges or thresholds for the color intensities to
  denote particular strengths of correlation?

  8. Would you like grid lines or separators between cells in the heatmap for visual
  clarity?

  9. Do you need a legend or key to explain the color intensities used in the heatmap?'
