initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart using the data from the given file. The chart
  should plot Engine Displacement (cc) on the x-axis and Gas Mileage (mpg) on the
  y-axis to analyze their relationship. Use the Weight (kg) column to represent the
  size of the bubbles and differentiate bubbles with distinct colors based on Power
  (kW). Ensure the chart is clear with appropriate labels, legends, and a title that
  reflects the engine displacement and gas mileage data for automobiles. Also, include
  a tooltip to display detailed information for each bubble point on hover.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  the bubbles based on Power (kW)?

  2. Would you prefer a specific shape for the bubbles, or are standard circular bubbles
  acceptable?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like for the chart title,
  axis labels, and legend?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the data points to be sorted or organized?

  5. Do you have any requirements for the chart''s background, such as gridlines or
  color?

  6. Would you like to include any specific thresholds or reference lines on the chart
  for better analysis?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the chart or should it follow a default format
  reflecting the data analyzed?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Standard circular bubbles are acceptable.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. A preferred title could be: "Relationship Between Engine Displacement and Gas
  Mileage in Automobiles".'
