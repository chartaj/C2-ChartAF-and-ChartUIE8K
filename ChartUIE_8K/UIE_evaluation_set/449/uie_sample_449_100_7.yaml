initial_prompt: Can you generate a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various
  automobile specifications described in the dataset? Specifically, we are interested
  in understanding the relationship between 0-60 mph acceleration time, gas mileage,
  power output, weight, and engine displacement. This visualization would help in
  identifying patterns and correlations among these attributes of different cars.
  Make sure to clearly label each axis and include a color bar to indicate the strength
  of the correlation. This will be a valuable tool for analyzing automobile performance
  metrics. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Is there a particular color scheme you would like for indicating the strength
  of the correlation?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  4. Should the correlation values be displayed on the cells of the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the automobile specifications on
  the axes?

  6. Are there any specific aspect ratios or dimensions you prefer for the heatmap?

  7. Would you prefer a certain range for the color bar (e.g., -1 to 1 for correlation
  values)?

  8. Do you have any styling preferences for the heatmap gridlines or borders?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Please label the axes with the specification names: 0-60 mph Acceleration Time,
  Gas Mileage, Power Output, Weight, Engine Displacement.

  4. Yes, please display the correlation values on the cells.

  5. I do not have a preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please use the range -1 to 1 for the color bar.

  8. I am not sure.'
