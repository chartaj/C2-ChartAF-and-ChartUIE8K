initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  engine displacement (in cc) and gas mileage (in mpg) for automobiles. Plot the engine
  displacement on the x-axis and gas mileage on the y-axis. Each point on the scatter
  plot should represent a different car. Make sure the axes are labeled appropriately,
  and add a title to the chart that reads "Engine Displacement vs. Gas Mileage". Ensure
  the data points are clearly visible and not overlapping too much. If possible, add
  a trend line to highlight any general relationship between the two variables.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color of the data points?

  2. Would you like to differentiate the data points by any specific categories (e.g.,
  car type, brand) using different colors or shapes?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or format for the trend line (e.g., dashed, solid,
  polynomial)?

  4. Are there any specific axis ranges you would like to set for the x-axis (engine
  displacement) and y-axis (gas mileage)?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight
  specific points or ranges?

  8. If there are overlapping data points, do you have a preferred method for ensuring
  they are clearly visible (e.g., transparency, jitter)?'
