initial_prompt: Please create a column chart using the provided data. The chart should
  visualize the relationship between the Engine Displacement (cc) and Gas Mileage
  (mpg) for various automobiles. Ensure that both axes are properly labeled, with
  Engine Displacement on the x-axis and Gas Mileage on the y-axis. Include a suitable
  title and make sure all data points are clearly visible. The chart should help in
  understanding how the engine size affects fuel efficiency in automobiles.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart? If so, do you prefer major
  or minor gridlines, or both?

  3. Do you want to display data values directly on top of the columns?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend, even though it has only two attributes?

  6. Would you like any trend lines or regression lines included to show the correlation
  more clearly?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart margins or padding to ensure labels
  and data points are clearly visible?

  8. Should the x-axis (Engine Displacement) be represented uniformly, or would you
  prefer logarithmic scaling?

  9. Do you want any specific annotations or explanations within the chart to highlight
  key insights?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or limits for the axes you would like to set to
  improve the visualization?'
