initial_prompt: Please create a matrix chart to visualize the relationship between
  engine displacement and gas mileage of automobiles. Use the columns provided in
  the dataset like '0-60 mph(sec)', 'Gas Mileage(mpg)', 'Power(kW)', 'Weight(kg)',
  'Engine Displacement(cc)'. Ensure that the chart effectively highlights how engine
  displacement impacts gas mileage while incorporating the influence of other variables
  such as power and weight. The rows and columns of the matrix should effectively
  represent the interactions between these features. This will help us understand
  the complexities and trade-offs in automobile performance.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the matrix chart?\n2. How\
  \ would you like the size of the markers or symbols to be represented in the matrix\
  \ chart?\n3. Should the matrix chart include labels or annotations for each data\
  \ point?\n4. Would you like to include trend lines to highlight correlations within\
  \ the matrix chart?\n5. Do you have a specific preference for the ordering of rows\
  \ and columns in the matrix chart?\n6. Should the chart include a legend to explain\
  \ the different variables and their interactions?\n7. How would you prefer the scale\
  \ of each variable to be represented (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?\n8. Do you have\
  \ preferences for the type of markers or symbols used in the chart (e.g., circles,\
  \ squares)?\n9. Is there a specific way you would like to handle overlapping data\
  \ points in the matrix chart? \n10. Would you like any specific emphasis or highlighting\
  \ on certain ranges of values within the chart?"
