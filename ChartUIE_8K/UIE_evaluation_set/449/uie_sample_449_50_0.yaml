initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the gas mileage and engine displacement
  across different automobiles. Annotate specific data points to highlight notable
  variations and ensure clear visual distinction for comparative analysis. This will
  help in understanding the relationship between engine displacement and fuel efficiency
  in vehicles.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different data points?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked in the bar chart?

  3. Do you have any specific annotations styles or formats you prefer?

  4. How prominent would you like the annotations for notable variations to be (e.g.,
  color, size)?

  5. Is there a preferred range or scale for the y-axis that you would like to set?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like included or customized?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the chart? If yes, any specific style
  or color preferences?

  9. Do you prefer the bars to be in a specific order (ascending/descending) based
  on gas mileage or engine displacement?

  10. Is there any additional text or reference information you would like to include
  on the chart?'
