initial_prompt: Create a matrix chart to visualize the relationship between engine
  displacement, gas mileage, and weight in automobiles. Include color gradients to
  represent power and size variations of the data points to indicate weight.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradients representing
  ''Power(kW)''?

  2. Would you like the weight of data points to be indicated by the size of the markers,
  or do you have another preference?

  3. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for the axes?

  4. Do you want to include any labels, titles, or annotations in the chart?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Would you like to use specific types of markers (e.g., circles, squares) to represent
  data points?

  7. Do you need a legend to explain the color gradient and marker size variations?

  8. Should any specific data points be highlighted or annotated?

  9. Are there any additional attributes or information you would like to include
  in tooltips when hovering over data points?

  10. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the matrix chart?'
