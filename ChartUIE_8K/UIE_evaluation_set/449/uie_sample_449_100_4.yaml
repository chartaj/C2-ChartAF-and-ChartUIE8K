initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualizing engine displacement and gas mileage
  data for various automobiles. The chart should display the distribution and variance
  of these two attributes across different vehicles. This will help to easily compare
  the spread and identify any outliers. Use 'Engine Displacement(cc)' on one axis
  and 'Gas Mileage(mpg)' on the other axis. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to
  interpret for someone assessing the performance and efficiency of the cars. No missing
  values should impact the visualization. Thanks!
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?\n2. Would\
  \ you like to include gridlines for better visual reference? \n3. Do you prefer\
  \ any particular scale (logarithmic or linear) for the axes?\n4. Are there any specific\
  \ labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart?\n5. Do you want the\
  \ chart to include a legend or key?\n6. Is there a specific font style or size you\
  \ prefer for the axis labels and title?\n7. Would you like to highlight or emphasize\
  \ outliers in a particular way?\n8. Do you have any preferences for the orientation\
  \ of the box plot (vertical or horizontal)?\n9. Should the whiskers of the box plot\
  \ extend to specific percentiles (e.g., 1.5 IQR)?\n10. Are there any particular\
  \ styling preferences for the boxes themselves (e.g., colors, line thickness)?"
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better visual reference.

  3. I am not sure about the scale, whatever you think best works.

  4. No specific labels or annotations needed.

  5. I don''t think a legend or key is necessary.

  6. No preference for font style or size.

  7. Yes, please highlight or emphasize outliers.

  8. I am not sure about the orientation, whatever looks best.

  9. I do not know about specific percentiles for the whiskers.

  10. I don''t have particular styling preferences for the boxes.'
