initial_prompt: Create a treemap chart visualizing the distribution of revenue generated
  by different product types (haircare, skincare) from file 97.csv. Display hierarchical
  levels indicating SKU, price range, and geographic location (city). This will help
  in understanding revenue contribution across categories and their subcategories.
  Highlight regions with high stock levels and low defect rates. Ensure the treemap
  reflects the scale of lead times and manufacturing costs to illustrate their impact
  on overall revenue. This will provide insights into optimizing supply chain efficiencies.
  Include color coding for easy differentiation between categories and key metrics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  product types, SKU, and other key metrics?

  2. Would you like a specific color gradient to represent different revenue levels?

  3. Should the treemap include labels for all hierarchical levels, or only for the
  main categories?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels in the treemap?

  5. Should the regions with high stock levels and low defect rates be highlighted
  in a particular color?

  6. Do you want a legend included in the treemap to explain the color coding and
  key metrics?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like the price ranges to be categorized for
  this visualization?

  8. Are there any specific geographic locations (cities) that should be emphasized
  or highlighted?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  product types, SKU, and other key metrics.
