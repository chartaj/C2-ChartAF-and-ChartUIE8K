initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that highlights the revenue generated versus the
  number of products sold for different product types in the supply chain. Use annotations
  to display the exact revenue values on the bars. Additionally, use different colors
  to represent each product type, and ensure that the bar representing the highest
  revenue is distinctly highlighted. This visualization will help us quickly assess
  which product types are performing best in terms of revenue and sales volume. Focus
  on making the information easily digestible for a business audience interested in
  supply chain performance.

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Do you want to include any specific references or notes directly on the chart?

  9. Would you like the chart to have a particular background color?
