initial_prompt: Create a heatmap displaying the correlation between different factors
  like price, availability, number of products sold, revenue generated, stock levels,
  defect rates, manufacturing costs, and shipping costs. This will help visualize
  relations and identify potential improvement areas in the supply chain.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?\n2.\
  \ Would you like to include labels for the correlation values on the heatmap?\n\
  3. Do you prefer a specific range or scale for the correlation values (e.g., -1\
  \ to 1)?\n4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color mapping?\n\
  5. Do you have any specific font or styling preferences for the text in the heatmap?\n\
  6. Would you like to highlight any particular correlations or areas of interest\
  \ within the heatmap? \n7. Is there a particular format or layout you prefer for\
  \ the heatmap (e.g., square or rectangular cells)?\n8. Do you have any preference\
  \ for the order of factors on the axes of the heatmap?\n9. Would you like to add\
  \ any titles, subtitles, or annotations to the heatmap for better context?\n10.\
  \ Should the heatmap be designed with a specific aspect ratio or size in mind?"
