initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of product
  types in our supply chain data. Highlight "haircare," "skincare," and any other
  category. This visualization should help us understand the proportion of each product
  type in our inventory. Use vibrant colors to differentiate between categories. Provide
  clear labels and a legend for clarity. Ensure the chart is interactive, allowing
  us to hover over segments to see actual numbers and percentages. This will aid in
  our business analysis and decision-making process. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. How would you like the highlighted categories ("haircare" and "skincare") to
  be differentiated?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and legends?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the categories in the legend and
  the chart?

  5. Would you like to include percentage labels on the segments in addition to hovering
  information?

  6. Should the chart display values in any specific units or formats?
