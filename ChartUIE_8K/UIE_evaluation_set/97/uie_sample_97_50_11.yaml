initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of product prices
  in our supply chain data. This will help us understand the price range and most
  common price points for our different product types (haircare, skincare).
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Do you want each product type (haircare and skincare) to be displayed in separate
  histograms, or in a single histogram with different colors for each type?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the histogram bars?

  4. Should the histogram include labels showing the frequency count for each bin?

  5. Do you have a preference for the axis labels and titles for the histogram?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between product types if
  they are displayed together?

  7. Is there a specific range of prices you want to focus on, or should the histogram
  cover all price ranges in the dataset?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or format of the histogram
  (e.g., gridlines, bar width)?'
