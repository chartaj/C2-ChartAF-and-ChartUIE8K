initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map for Supply Chain Analysis showing the
  geographic distribution of supplier locations and associated lead times. Use data
  from the 'Location' and 'Lead time' columns in '../Extra_datas/data/97.csv'. Each
  region should be colored based on the lead time, with a gradient indicating shorter
  to longer durations. This visualization will help in identifying regions with excessive
  lead times and potential supply chain inefficiencies. Include a legend for lead
  times, and make sure that areas without data are clearly distinguished. The map
  will aid in strategic decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the lead time gradient?

  2. What color would you prefer for regions without data?

  3. Should the map display country borders or other geopolitical boundaries?

  4. Would you like additional markers or annotations on the map to highlight specific
  regions or outliers?

  5. Is there a preferred range for the lead times legend?

  6. Are there any specific geographic regions or countries you want to emphasize
  or focus on?

  7. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  8. Should the map include labels (names) for countries, cities, or regions?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette in mind.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, the map should display country borders.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. No specific geographic regions or countries to emphasize.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, the map should include labels for countries.'
