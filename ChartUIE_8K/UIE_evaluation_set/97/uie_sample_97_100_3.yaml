initial_prompt: I need a box plot to analyze the distribution of shipping costs across
  different shipping carriers. The x-axis should represent the shipping carriers,
  and the y-axis should show the shipping costs. Include data for all available shipping
  carriers from the dataset. Additionally, overlay the median, upper quartile, and
  lower quartile on the plot for each carrier. This will help in understanding the
  variability and central tendency of shipping costs associated with different carriers.
  Make sure to label the axes and the plot clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box plot?

  2. Would you like to include additional statistical measures, such as mean or standard
  deviation, on the plot?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the style and placement of axis labels and titles?

  4. Would you prefer any specific range or scale for the y-axis (shipping costs)?

  5. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the text on the plot?

  7. Are there any specific styling preferences for the box whiskers and outliers?

  8. Would you like to add a legend to the plot?

  9. Should there be any annotations or markers to highlight specific data points
  or ranges?

  10. Do you prefer a particular layout or ordering of the shipping carriers on the
  x-axis?'
