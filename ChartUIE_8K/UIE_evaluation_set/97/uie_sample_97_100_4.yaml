initial_prompt: I need an area chart visualizing the supply chain data for our business.
  Specifically, I want to see the variation in revenue generated over time alongside
  the number of products sold and stock levels. Highlight any trends or spikes in
  the revenue and correlate these with changes in stock levels and products sold.
  Additionally, indicate any significant changes in shipping costs on the same chart.
  Use different colors to distinguish between these metrics. Make sure the time intervals
  are on the X-axis and the respective values on the Y-axis. This will help in better
  decision-making for inventory and logistics planning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors to use for
  each metric?

  2. What time intervals would you prefer on the X-axis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between the different metrics?

  4. How would you like trends or spikes in the revenue to be highlighted (e.g., using
  annotations, markers, or shading)?

  5. Is there a preferred style for the area chart (e.g., stacked areas or overlapping
  transparent areas)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading for better readability?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis scaling (e.g., linear, log scale)?

  8. Should there be any specific titles or labels for the chart and axes?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Monthly intervals would be preferred.

  3. Yes, the chart should include a legend to distinguish between the different metrics.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Stacked areas would be ideal.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Linear scale would be fine.

  8. Title: "Supply Chain Metrics Over Time"; X-axis: "Time (Months)"; Y-axis: "Values".'
