initial_prompt: Create a pie chart illustrating the proportion of sales by category.

  the dominant categories in Superstore Sales data.

  color, larger slice, bold outline)?

  3. What font size and style do you prefer for the percentage annotations?

  4. Would you like a legend included in the chart, or should each slice be self-explanatory?

  5. Do you prefer the percentage values to be displayed inside the pie slices or
  outside with lines pointing to slices?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the pie chart?

  7. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to add besides percentage
  values?

  8. Should the chart include the total sales amount as part of the annotation or
  in a subtitle?'
