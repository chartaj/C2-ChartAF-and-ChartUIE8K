initial_prompt: I want a histogram visualizing the 'Sales' distribution from the Superstore
  Sales data. Could you create bins for the sales amounts and show the frequency of
  orders within those bins? Make sure to label the axes clearly, with 'Sales Amount'
  on the x-axis and 'Frequency' on the y-axis. The histogram should give me a clear
  idea of how sales amounts are distributed across different orders in the dataset.
  Also, please ensure that the chart looks professional and is easy to understand.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins or the bin
  width for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the bins to be of equal width or should they be adjusted to better
  reflect the distribution of the data?

  3. Are there any specific color preferences for the histogram bars or background?

  4. Do you prefer any specific style or theme (e.g., minimalist, corporate, vibrant)
  for the histogram?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or additional labels on the chart (e.g.,
  mean, median)?

  6. Is there a need for any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  7. Should the chart include a grid (horizontal, vertical, or both) for better readability?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines or standards that the chart should comply with
  (e.g., company branding, color blindness considerations)?

  9. Do you want to display any summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation)
  alongside the histogram?

  10. Would you like to add any specific title or subtitle to the histogram?'
