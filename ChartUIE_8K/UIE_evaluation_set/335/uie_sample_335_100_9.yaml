initial_prompt: I have a dataset about Superstore Sales that captures various sales
  metrics such as profit, sales, and regions. I want a Choropleth map visualization
  highlighting the profit across different states in the United States. Use the ‘State’
  column to distinguish between the states by color intensity, where darker shades
  represent higher profit margins. This will help me quickly identify which regions
  are performing better. Make sure the map includes data labels for each state displaying
  the profit value. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the Choropleth map?

  2. Should the map have a specific title or any additional annotations?

  3. Do you want a legend to be included to explain the color intensities?

  4. Would you prefer the state labels to be inside the state boundaries or outside
  with connectors?

  5. Do you want to include any specific font style or size for the data labels and
  state names?

  6. Should the map include any borderlines for the states, and if so, in what color
  or style?'
