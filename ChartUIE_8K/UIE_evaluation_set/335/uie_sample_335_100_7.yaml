initial_prompt: I need help creating a Box chart using the provided Superstore Sales
  data. Please visualize the distribution of 'Sales' across different 'Categories'
  using a Box chart. This will help me understand the sales variation within each
  category (Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology). Ensure the X-axis represents
  the 'Category' and the Y-axis represents 'Sales'. Also, show outliers to identify
  any unusual sales figures. Your assistance in creating this chart will help me analyze
  the performance in each category effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you want to display the median values explicitly on the Box chart?

  4. Should we include whiskers to indicate the variability outside the upper and
  lower quartiles?

  5. Do you want to label the outliers individually if they exist?

  6. Are there any specific formatting preferences for axis labels (font size, style,
  etc.)?

  7. Would you prefer a specific background color for the chart?

  8. Do you prefer the Box chart to be oriented in a specific way (vertical or horizontal)?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical summary (mean, standard deviation)
  to be displayed on the chart?'
