initial_prompt: I have sales data from a superstore. I want to create a treemap chart
  to visualize sales performance. The treemap should break down sales by Category
  and further by Sub-Category. Each rectangle represents the total sales amount for
  that Category, and each nested rectangle represents the Sub-Category sales. The
  size of each rectangle should be proportional to the sales amount, and different
  colors could denote different Categories. This chart will help me quickly see which
  Categories and Sub-Categories are generating the most revenue and compare their
  performance visually.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different Categories?

  2. Would you like to display sales values on the rectangles?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for any text within the chart?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the Categories and Sub-Categories
  to be displayed, such as by total sales value or alphabetically?

  5. Do you prefer rounded or sharp edges for the rectangles?

  6. Would you like any additional information or tooltips to appear when hovering
  over the rectangles?

  7. Do you want a legend to denote the Categories by color?

  8. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?'
