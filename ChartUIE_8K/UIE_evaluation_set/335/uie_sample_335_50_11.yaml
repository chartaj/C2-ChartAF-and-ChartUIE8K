initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the sales distribution across different
  categories and sub-categories from the Superstore Sales dataset. Use 'Category'
  and 'Sub-Category' as hierarchy levels, with 'Sales' determining the size of each
  box. Include profit margins as color intensities.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or color schemes for indicating
  profit margins?

  2. Would you like labels for each category and sub-category to be shown inside the
  boxes, or should they appear as a tooltip on hover?

  3. How would you like to handle categories or sub-categories with very small sales
  values? Should they be aggregated under an "Others" category?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like categories and sub-categories
  to be displayed (e.g., highest sales first)?

  5. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the text within the treemap?

  6. Should the treemap include a legend explaining the color intensities associated
  with profit margins?

  7. Do you need any additional annotations or highlights, such as marking the top-performing
  category or sub-category?'
