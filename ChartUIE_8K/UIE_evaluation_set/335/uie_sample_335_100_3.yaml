initial_prompt: Iâ€™d like a grouped column chart for the Superstore Sales data. The
  x-axis should display the "State" categories, and the y-axis should represent "Sales"
  values. Group the columns by "Category" to compare sales across different states
  within each product category (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology). Please color-code
  the categories for clarity. Additionally, include a legend to differentiate between
  the categories. Ensure the chart has clear labels, a title for context, and a clean,
  professional look suitable for business reporting and analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme?

  3. How would you like the axis labels to be styled (font size, font type, etc.)?

  4. Would you like any specific gridlines or background elements on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer the sales values to be displayed on the bars or as hover-over tooltips?

  6. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the legend?

  7. Is there a target value or benchmark line you would like to include on the y-axis?

  8. Would you prefer any annotations or data callouts on specific data points?'
