initial_prompt: 'I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  `Sales` and `Profit` using the "Superstore Sales" data. Each point should represent
  an individual order, with `Sales` on the X-axis and `Profit` on the Y-axis. Additionally,
  use different colors or markers to distinguish between different `Categories` to
  see how they cluster. Please include the `Customer Segment` as another dimension,
  possibly by varying the size or shape of the scatter points. Make sure the plot
  is clear and easy to interpret.

  '
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing different categories?

  2. Which shapes or markers would you prefer to use for different customer segments?

  3. What range would you prefer for the size of the scatter points to represent different
  customer segments?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on the scatter
  plot?

  5. Do you have any preference for the background or grid style of the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain colors, markers, and sizes used,
  and where should it be positioned?

  7. Is the aspect ratio of the plot important to you?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for axis labels or title of the scatter
  plot?

  9. Would you like to apply any specific data transformations (e.g., log scale) on
  the axes?

  10. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text elements (titles,
  labels, legend)?'
