initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the Superstore Sales data. The
  x-axis should represent different product categories, and the y-axis should show
  the total sales for each category. Use different colors to distinguish the sub-categories
  within each product category. Additionally, include data labels displaying the exact
  sales figures on top of the columns. This will help in understanding which product
  categories and sub-categories are generating the most revenue. Following this, we
  can analyze trends and make better business decisions based on the visual insights
  from the chart.
