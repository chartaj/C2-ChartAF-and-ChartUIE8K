initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the provided Superstore Sales data.
  The heatmap should show the sales distribution across different states in the United
  States. Use the 'State' for geographic location and 'Sales' for the intensity of
  the heatmap. Highlight regions with higher sales with warmer colors and lower sales
  with cooler colors. Ensure the map is interactive so users can hover over each state
  to see the total sales figures. This will help visualize sales performance regionally
  and identify key market areas. Add a legend to interpret the heatmap colors easily.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the warmer and cooler regions
  on the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include state borders for better geographical context, and
  if yes, what color should the borders be?

  3. Do you have a preference for the base map style (e.g., satellite, terrain, minimal)?

  4. Should we include additional labels such as state names or sales figures on the
  map, and if so, how should they be displayed?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the legend and tooltips?

  6. Any specific title or caption you would like to add to the visualization?

  7. Should the heatmap be scalable to different devices (e.g., mobile, tablet, desktop)?

  8. Are there any accessibility considerations we should take into account (e.g.,
  colorblind-friendly palette)?'
