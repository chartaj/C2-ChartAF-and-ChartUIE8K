initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize relationships in the Dow Jones
  Industrial Average data. On the X-axis, use ''Temperature(K)'' and ''Temperature(K).1'',
  and on the Y-axis, ''Pressure(Liquid)'' and ''Pressure(Gas)''. Highlight points
  where there''s a significant variation in pressure. Include text annotations for
  notable data points to emphasize key temperatures and pressures. Purpose: Understand
  correlations and patterns, focusing on outliers or unique points in the dataset.
  The use of text annotations will help in identifying specific data trends and anomalies.
  Suitable for business analysis and decision-making contexts.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like significant variations in pressure to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different colors, sizes, or markers)?

  3. Do you have a specific format or style for text annotations for notable data
  points?

  4. Should the X-axis and Y-axis have specific labels or units other than the default?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific range for the X and Y axes that you would prefer to focus
  on?

  7. Do you have any specific fonts or styles in mind for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Would you prefer to avoid overlapping text annotations, and if so, how should
  they be managed (e.g., using callouts or leader lines)?

  9. Should the scatter plot include a legend to distinguish between different data
  points or categories?

  10. Are there any additional elements you would like to include, such as trend lines
  or regression lines, to further understand correlations and patterns?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Different colors would be good to highlight significant variations in pressure.

  3. I do not have a specific format or style for text annotations.

  4. I am not sure about needing specific labels or units for the X-axis and Y-axis.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  6. I do not have a specific range for the X and Y axes in mind.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for fonts or styles for the axis labels and
  titles.

  8. Yes, Iâ€™d prefer to avoid overlapping text annotations; callouts or leader lines
  would be helpful.

  9. Yes, a legend would be useful to distinguish between different data points or
  categories.

  10. I do not know about including trend lines or regression lines.'
