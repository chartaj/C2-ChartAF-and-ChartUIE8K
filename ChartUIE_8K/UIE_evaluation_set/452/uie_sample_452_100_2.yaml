initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to represent the Dow Jones Industrial Average.
  Use Temperature(K) and Pressure(Liquid) from the first dataset for the main plot.
  Ensure that the bars are differentiated by unique colors to represent different
  Temperature(K) values. Add text annotations for the highest and lowest Pressure(Liquid)
  values to highlight these key data points. The chart should help viewers quickly
  understand fluctuations in pressure corresponding to temperature changes and highlight
  standout points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the bars
  representing different Temperature(K) values?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for the highest and lowest Pressure(Liquid)
  values to be displayed (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific axis labels or titles for the chart?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding of the bars?

  5. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?

  6. Are there any specific preferences for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  7. Do you want to set specific ranges or limits for the X or Y axes?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to have grid lines for better readability?

  9. Should any additional contextual information or notes be included in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I would like the text annotations for the highest and lowest Pressure(Liquid)
  values to be displayed in a larger font size and in red color. Placement should
  be close to the respective bars.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, including a legend to explain the color coding of the bars would be helpful.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, adding grid lines would make it more readable.

  9. I do not know.'
