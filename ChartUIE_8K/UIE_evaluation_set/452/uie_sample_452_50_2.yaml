initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the average Temperature(K) and Pressure
  (Liquid, Gas) from the dataset. Highlight and annotate the highest and lowest values
  for temperature and pressure. Utilize the Dow Jones Industrial Average context to
  draw business insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the bars representing Temperature and Pressure be distinguished by different
  colors or patterns?

  3. Do you want the chart to include grid lines for better readability of values?

  4. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Do you have any specific preferences
  for the font size or style?

  marker?

  6. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of annotations for the highest
  and lowest values (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitle? If yes, do you have
  any specific wording in mind?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between Temperature and Pressure
  data?

  9. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the y-axis, such as starting
  at zero or including specific intervals?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout of the chart (e.g., bar width,
