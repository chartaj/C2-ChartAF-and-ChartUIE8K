initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing temperature and pressure measurements
  for both liquids and gases at various conditions. I need a heatmap to visualize
  the relationships between these variables. Specifically, I want to compare the liquefied
  and gaseous states under different temperatures and pressures. The x-axis should
  be Temperature(K) and Temperature(K).1, while the y-axis should be Pressure(Liquid)
  and Pressure(Gas). Use a color gradient to indicate the density or concentration
  of data points. This will help me understand how pressure varies with temperature
  in both states. Please provide a clear and interpretative heatmap.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color gradient or color palette
  for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color gradient to be continuous or segmented into specific
  intervals?

  3. Do you want axis labels and titles to be formatted in a certain way, such as
  specific fonts or sizes?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend indicating the scale of the color gradient?

  5. Do you prefer grid lines or any other specific styling on the axes?

  6. Are there any specific ranges of temperature or pressure you want to zoom in
  on or highlight?

  7. Would you like any annotations or markers for specific data points, such as maximum
  or minimum values?

  8. Should the heatmap be displayed in a specific orientation or layout?

  9. Would you like to include any additional context or metadata, such as units of
  measurement, in the chart title or legend?

  10. Do you have preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?'
