initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing temperature and pressure for both
  liquid and gas phases. Highlight critical data points where gas pressure values
  are labeled. Use distinct colors for liquid and gas lines. Add annotations highlighting
  temperatures of significant changes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent the liquid
  and gas lines?

  2. What style of lines do you prefer (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  3. How would you like the critical data points to be highlighted (e.g., size, shape)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the placement and format of annotations for significant
  temperature changes?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you prefer them to be in the
  background or prominently displayed?

  6. Is there a specific font type and size you prefer for labels and annotations?

  7. Do you want any specific legend customization (e.g., position, description) for
  distinguishing the liquid and gas phases?

  8. Should the axes be labeled or formatted in a particular way (e.g., units, scale
  type)?

  9. Do you require a title or subtitle for the chart, and if so, what should it be?'
