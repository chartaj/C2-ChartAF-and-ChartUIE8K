  sure to include text annotations for the mean values, and highlights for Age groups
  70-75 and 80-85 to emphasize critical age ranges.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Should the text annotations for the mean values include both the exact value
  and a descriptive label (e.g., ''Mean Age: 72'')?

  3. How would you like the critical age ranges (70-75 and 80-85) to be highlighted?
  Would you prefer shaded areas, different colored bars, or another method?

  you prefer separate histograms for each attribute?

  5. Do you have a preferred title or any specific labels you want for the axes?'
