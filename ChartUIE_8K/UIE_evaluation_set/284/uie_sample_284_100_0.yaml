initial_prompt: I want to create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'MMSE'
  scores among different 'Age' groups in the Alzheimer's Disease dataset. Highlight
  the quartiles and median to emphasize central tendency and spread. Annote the box
  plot with the highest and lowest 'MMSE' score for each age group, drawing attention
  to outliers. This visualization will help identify any potential age-related patterns
  in cognitive function as measured by the MMSE score. The audience is healthcare
  professionals analyzing cognitive decline in Alzheimer's patients.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to customize the age group intervals, or should we use default
  groupings?

  3. Do you prefer specific labeling formats for the quartiles and median values?

  4. Are there any particular styles or markers you would like for annotating the
  highest and lowest ''MMSE'' scores?

  5. Do you want grid lines in the background for better readability?

  6. Should the chart include a title and subtitles, and if so, do you have any specific
  text in mind?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall dimensions (width and height) of
  the chart?

  8. Would you like a legend included, and if so, should it be positioned in a specific
  location?

  9. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  10. Would you prefer to have the data points (outliers) displayed individually on
  the box plot or just referenced with annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  MMSE Scores by Age Group," and the subtitle can be "Analyzing Cognitive Function
  in Alzheimerâ€™s Patients."
