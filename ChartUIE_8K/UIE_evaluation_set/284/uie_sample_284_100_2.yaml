initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset. Plot Age
  on the X-axis, and MMSE on the Y-axis to visualize cognitive decline trends across
  different ages. Include text annotations for MMSE values to highlight cognitive
  scores for ages 73, 89, and 73. Use highlights to emphasize data points with high
  and low MMSE scores. The chart aims to show the correlation between age and cognitive
  function. Use different colors for each data line to show variations effectively.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines\
  \ representing the variations?\n2. What style or type of text annotations do you\
  \ prefer for the MMSE values at ages 73, 89, and 73?\n3. Do you want to use specific\
  \ symbols or shapes for highlighting data points with high and low MMSE scores?\n\
  4. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the labels\
  \ and annotations?\n5. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed)\
  \ for the data lines?\n6. Would you like to include gridlines in the background\
  \ of the chart? If yes, what style do you prefer for gridlines?\n7. Is there any\
  \ specific requirement for the orientation or angle of the X-axis and Y-axis labels?\
  \ \n8. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend on the chart?\n\
  9. Would you like to include any tooltips or hover-over text for additional information\
  \ on specific data points?\n10. Are there any additional labels or markers you want\
  \ to highlight on the chart besides the requested points?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer clear and readable text annotations close to the data points for ages
  73, 89, and 73.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines. I have no specific preference for the style.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No, I would like an image, not interactive tooltips.

  10. No, just the requested points are sufficient.'
