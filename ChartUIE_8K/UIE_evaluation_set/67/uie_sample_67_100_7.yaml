initial_prompt: I need a pie chart visualizing the Samsung Stock Price Dataset. The
  chart should represent the proportion of different volume ranges traded over the
  available dates. Please categorize the volumes into ranges (e.g., 0-10M, 10M-20M,
  etc.) and display how much volume falls into each category. Include labels and percentages
  for each section of the pie to make it clear. This will help me understand the distribution
  of traded volumes over the given period at a glance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart sections?

  2. What specific volume ranges would you like to use for categorization (e.g., 0-10M,
  10M-20M)?

  3. Should the pie chart include a legend alongside the labels and percentages?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the labels and percentages?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the pie chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you require any specific notations or explanations outside the pie chart?

  7. Should the segments of the pie chart be ordered in a particular way (e.g., ascending,
  descending by volume)?

  8. Do you want to highlight any particular segment of the pie chart?

  9. Is there a specific format or alignment you prefer for the labels and percentages
  (e.g., inside the segments, outside the segments)?

  10. Should the chart include any additional details or annotations for context?'
