initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Samsung's stock price with the 'Date'
  on the x-axis and 'Adj Close' on the y-axis. Highlight points with particularly
  high volumes by changing their color and size, drawing attention to significant
  trading days. Additionally, include text annotations on outlier points at the highest
  and lowest adjusted close prices to focus viewer's attention. This will help in
  identifying key fluctuations over time. The purpose is to analyze stock performance
  and volume correlation for better investment insights. Use given annotations to
  enhance the viewer's understanding and context.
