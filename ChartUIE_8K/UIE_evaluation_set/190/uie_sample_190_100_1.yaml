initial_prompt: Let's create a grouped bar chart to compare the 'Outcome' variable
  (0 or 1) against different factors such as 'BMI', 'Age', and 'Glucose'. Each bar
  will represent the average value for each factor, grouped by 'Outcome'. Text annotations
  will highlight key differences and high/low values. Highlights will be used to emphasize
  significant differences between groups. This will help in visualizing how these
  factors correlate with diabetes presence and can provide valuable insights for health
  research and patient education.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars, especially to differentiate
  ''Outcome'' groups (0 and 1)?

  2. Would you like to include error bars to represent variability or standard deviation?

  3. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to describe what each color represents?

  5. Are there specific axis titles or labels you prefer for the X and Y axes?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a specific title? If so, what should it be?

  7. Would you like gridlines for better readability? If yes, do you prefer horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the factors (''BMI'', ''Age'', ''Glucose'')
  to be displayed on the chart?

  9. Would you like to use specific thresholds to annotate high/low values, or should
  it be automatically determined based on the data?

  10. Should the bars be displayed with a specific width or spacing between groups?

  11. Are there any additional data points or contextual information you would like
  to include in the annotations?'
