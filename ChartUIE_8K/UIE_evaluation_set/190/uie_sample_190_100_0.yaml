initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the diabetes dataset showing the
  relationship between BMI and Glucose levels. Use text annotations to highlight data
  points with extreme Glucose levels to draw attention to potential outliers. Additionally,
  change the color of points where the Outcome is 1 to emphasize cases of diabetes.
  The scatter plot should help identify any trends or patterns in glucose levels concerning
  BMI, aiding in understanding how these factors contribute to diabetes. Make sure
  the axes are labeled, and a legend is included to distinguish between diabetic and
  non-diabetic outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. Is there a specific color scheme you would like for highlighting the Outcome?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the plot?

  4. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for diabetic and non-diabetic data points?

  5. What font size and style would you like for the text annotations?

  6. Do you have any specific range for the x-axis (BMI) or y-axis (Glucose levels)?

  7. Should the scatter plot include data point sizes based on another attribute?

  8. Do you want to include a regression line or any other trend line in the scatter
  plot?'
answers: "<start of user emulated response>\n1. I do not have a preferred title. \n\
  2. I am not sure, any distinct colors would work.\n3. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.\n\
  4. I have no specific preference.\n5. I do not know, standard font size and style\
  \ should be fine.\n6. I do not have any specific range in mind.\n7. No, I do not\
  \ need data point sizes based on another attribute.\n8. I am not sure, maybe a simple\
  \ regression line if it helps in identifying trends.\n<end of user emulated response>"
