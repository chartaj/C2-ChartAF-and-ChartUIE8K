initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Glucose
  levels and BMI from the Diabetes Dataset. Annotate specific data points, highlighting
  one with high BMI and glucose levels to emphasize potential diabetes risk. Use color
  to differentiate between Outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall color scheme of
  the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Any specific format or additional
  information to include?

  3. Are there particular colors you would prefer to use for differentiating between
  Outcomes?

  4. Any preferences for the type or style of markers used in the scatter plot (e.g.,
  circles, squares, triangles)?

  5. What type of annotations would you like for the highlighted data points (e.g.,
  labels, arrows)?

  6. Do you want to specify the exact data point(s) to highlight, or should we automatically
  choose the highest BMI and glucose level point?

  7. Should the scatter plot include a legend explaining the colors used for different
  Outcomes?

  8. Do you prefer a grid to be displayed on the background for better data readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the axes to be labeled as "Glucose Levels" and "BMI". No additional
  information is needed.

  3. I do not have any specific preferences.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Labels would be good for the highlighted data points.

  6. Automatically choose the highest BMI and glucose level point.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the colors used for different Outcomes.

  8. I am not sure.'
