initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showcasing correlations among different health metrics
  in the Diabetes Dataset, highlighting relationships between Glucose, BloodPressure,
  BMI, Age, and Outcome to identify patterns that indicate diabetes prevalence.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific values to be annotated on the heatmap cells?

  3. Do you have a preference for the color gradient (e.g., cool to warm, monochromatic)
  to represent correlations?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the correlation values?

  5. Do you want the chart to have gridlines separating each cell?

  6. Are there specific axis labels or titles you would like to include?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to be square-shaped or rectangular?

  8. Should the chart include any additional descriptive text or data labels?'
