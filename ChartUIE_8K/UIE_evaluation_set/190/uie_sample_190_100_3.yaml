initial_prompt: I'd like to create a heatmap visualizing correlations between various
  health indicators in the Diabetes Dataset. Please use the summary data for columns
  such as Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction,
  Age, and Outcome. The heatmap should highlight relationships between these factors,
  offering insights into how they might impact the likelihood of diabetes. Ensure
  to include the unique values and data types to support the correlations comprehensively.
  This will help in understanding the interplay between these health metrics better.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should we annotate the heatmap cells with correlation coefficient values?

  3. Should the heatmap include a color bar legend to explain the correlation strength?

  4. Do you have a preferred range (e.g., -1 to 1) for the correlation values represented
  in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to cluster the variables to show groups with similar correlation
  patterns?

  6. Do you prefer a particular orientation for the labels (e.g., horizontal or vertical)
  on the axes?

  7. Should there be any specific emphasis (e.g., bolding, different color) on particular
  correlations or health indicators?

  8. Would you like to include any additional descriptive text or labels within the
  heatmap to provide context?'
