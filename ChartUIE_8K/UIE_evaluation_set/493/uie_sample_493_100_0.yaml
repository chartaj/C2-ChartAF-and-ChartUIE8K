initial_prompt: Please create a Spline chart with the provided data, focusing on the
  relationship between 'x' and 'y'. Ensure that data-driven text annotations are included
  to highlight specific data points, especially where the 'y' values peak. Also, use
  highlights to differentiate key elements for easier visualization. This visualization
  will illustrate smooth transitions between points, emphasizing trends and patterns
  in the dataset. Remember to provide context and orientation annotations to help
  the viewer understand the chart's purpose and findings.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or palette preference for the chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations and labels?

  3. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  4. Do you have a specific style or format preference for the text annotations?

  5. Are there any particular data points you want to highlight aside from the peak
  ''y'' values?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style for highlighting key elements (e.g., bold, different
  color, different marker)?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, should they be
  for both the x and y axes?

  8. Should the axes have specific titles or labels, and if so, what should they be?

  9. Are there any preferences for the overall chart layout (e.g., title position,
  margins)?

  10. Do you require any additional context or orientation annotations to be included,
  and if so, could you specify what information they should contain?'
