initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing global alcohol consumption using
  the dataset. Focus on distinguishing countries based on their total litres of pure
  alcohol consumed per year. Annotate specific countries with high and low alcohol
  consumption to highlight differences. Emphasize regions with color gradients to
  make comparisons easier. Include data-driven annotations for countries like Afghanistan
  (0.0) and Albania (4.9) to draw attention. The visualization should reflect the
  overall global drinking patterns and provide clear insights into regional trends
  for better understanding of alcohol consumption worldwide. Keep in mind the food-and-drink
  context for practical uses.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients you would prefer to use for
  the map?

  2. Should we use a particular color scheme for distinguishing high and low alcohol
  consumption?

  3. How would you like the annotations to appearâ€”text labels, icons, or another format?

  4. Are there any other specific countries you want to be highlighted besides Afghanistan
  and Albania?

  5. Do you prefer any particular styling for the country borders on the map?

  6. Should the map include any additional geographic markers or labels (e.g., major
  cities, regions)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map''s projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. Would you like to add any legends or explanatory text to help interpret the color
  gradients?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you wish to use for annotations and
  labels?

  10. Do you want the visualization to include any additional data insights or contextual
  information (e.g., historical trends, comparisons with other datasets)?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe a gradient from blue (low) to red (high) could be effective?

  3. Text labels would be best for the annotations.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No, just focus on the countries and alcohol consumption.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to help interpret the color gradients.

  9. I do not know.

  10. No additional data insights are needed.
