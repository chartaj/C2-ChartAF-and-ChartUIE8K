initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the alcohol consumption data around
  the world. Use the ''country'' column for labeling, and plot ''total_litres_of_pure_alcohol''
  on the y-axis against ''beer_servings'' on the x-axis. Color-code the different
  types of alcohol servings: beer, spirits, and wine. This will help in understanding
  the relationship between different types of alcohol consumption and overall alcohol
  intake per country. Ensure to label the axes and include a legend for clarity. The
  chart should provide a clear overview of how alcohol consumption patterns differ
  across countries.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the different
  alcohol servings?

  2. What font and size would you like for the country labels?

  3. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or emphasize in the scatter
  plot?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  5. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., simple ''Beer Servings'' versus
  ''Number of Beer Servings per Capita'')?

  6. Do you prefer the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  chart?'
