initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing alcohol consumption by country. Use
  color gradients to represent "total_litres_of_pure_alcohol." Add text annotations
  for countries with extreme values. Highlight regions with significantly higher or
  lower consumption.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color gradients?

  2. How many levels of color gradients would you like to use (e.g., 5 levels, 7 levels)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the range of values in the color scale (e.g., 0
  to 10 liters)?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to appear (e.g., bold, different color)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. How would you like the regions with significantly higher or lower consumption
  to be highlighted (e.g., borders, different color shades)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend for the color gradients?

  8. Do you have specific requirements for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  9. Is there a preferred layout for the map (e.g., rectangular, equal area)?'
