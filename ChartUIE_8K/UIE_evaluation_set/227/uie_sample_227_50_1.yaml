initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap showing correlations between factors like age,
  IQ, health, job, and contributions to humanity for ethical evaluations in the Trolley
  Dilemma context. Highlight significant patterns and data-driven text annotations
  for insights.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display values with a gradient or discrete color bands?

  3. Do you have a preference for the range of correlation values to highlight (e.g.,
  values above 0.7)?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines to separate the individual cells?

  5. How would you like significant patterns to be highlighted (e.g., colored borders,
  bold text)?

  6. Do you prefer annotations inside the heatmap cells or outside the chart?

  7. Should the annotations include exact correlation values or descriptive texts?

  8. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for text annotations?

  9. Are there any additional visual elements you would like to include, such as a
  legend or axis labels?

  10. Should there be any specific ordering of the factors (e.g., ascending, descending)?'
