initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the age distribution from the dataset.
  Highlight the "age" column and add text annotations showing the values linked to
  the bars representing different age ranges. This will help emphasize specific age
  groups and draw attention to any notable patterns. Use different colors to highlight
  significant age ranges. The purpose is to understand the age demographic represented
  in the Trolley Dilemma dataset. Include context about expected years left to provide
  more depth. This visualization will aid in analyzing the ethical implications across
  different age groups.
questions: '1. What specific age ranges would you like to highlight with different
  colors?

  2. Do you have preferred color schemes for the histogram and the highlighted age
  ranges?

  3. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like the "expected years left" context to be incorporated into
  the histogram? Would you prefer a secondary axis or additional annotations?

  5. Are there specific patterns or age groups you are particularly interested in
  emphasizing in this visualization?

  6. Would you prefer the histogram to have a specific bin width or number of bins?

  7. Do you have any preference regarding the overall design and layout of the histogram
  (e.g., axis labels, title, legend placement)?

  8. Are there any additional details or contextual information you would like to
  include to make the insights clearer for the audience?'
