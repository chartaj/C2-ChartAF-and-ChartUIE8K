initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the distribution of individuals'
  contributions to humanity by country. Use the "country" and "contribution_to_humanity"
  columns from the provided data format. The heatmap should highlight countries with
  higher contributions in a darker shade and those with lower contributions in a lighter
  shade. Ensure that each country is clearly labeled and use a color gradient to indicate
  varying levels of contribution. This visualization will help to identify which countries
  have individuals making significant contributions to humanity and those that may
  not.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  2. How many color shades would you prefer to use in the gradient?

  3. Would you like the country labels to be displayed in any particular font style
  or size?

  4. Do you have any preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.) for
  the heatmap?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like to handle countries with missing data
  on contributions?

  6. Would you prefer the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color gradient
  values?

  7. Is there any specific background or border color you would like for the map?

  8. Do you have a preference for the geographical boundaries (e.g., thick or thin
  lines) shown on the map?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific countries for emphasis?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like displayed on the heatmap?'
