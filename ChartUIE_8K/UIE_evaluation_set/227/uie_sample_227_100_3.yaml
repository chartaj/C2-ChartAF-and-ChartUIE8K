initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the "Trolley Dilemma" dataset. Map the 'age'
  on the x-axis and 'IQ' on the y-axis, using different colors to distinguish between
  'gender'. The plot should also incorporate different shapes or markers for 'job'.
  The aim is to visualize the correlation between age, IQ, gender, and job type in
  the context of the philosophical and ethical aspects of the dilemma. Ensure the
  plot is clear and includes a legend for understanding the various categories. Please
  make sure any missing data is appropriately handled or marked. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette to represent
  different genders?

  2. Are there particular marker shapes that you would like to use for different job
  types?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Should we include grid lines in the scatter plot for better readability?

  5. Do you have any specific instructions on how to handle or display missing data
  points?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or additional labels on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  9. Should the axes have a specific range or be auto-adjusted based on the data?'
