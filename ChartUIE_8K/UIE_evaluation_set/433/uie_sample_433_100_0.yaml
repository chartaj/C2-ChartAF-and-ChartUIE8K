initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the production of craft beer. The
  x-axis should represent different brewer sizes, and the y-axis should show the number
  of brewers. Display text annotations for the top three brewer sizes. Highlight the
  bars representing '6,000,001 Barrels and Over', '1,000,001 to 6,000,000 Barrels',
  and '500,001 to 1,000,000 Barrels' to emphasize their importance. The chart will
  help us understand the distribution of craft beer production across different brewer
  sizes and how many brewers fall into each category. This is useful for the food-and-drink
  industry analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the chart?

  2. Do you have a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the highlighted bars to be formatted (e.g., different color,
  pattern)?

  4. Do you want a specific order for the brewer sizes on the x-axis (e.g., ascending
  size, descending size)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the highlighted bars?

  6. Would you like to add a title and subtitle to the chart? If so, please specify.

  7. Do you have a preference for the position of the text annotations (e.g., inside
  bar, outside bar)?

  8. Should there be gridlines on the y-axis? If yes, should they be subtle or prominent?

  9. Do you want to include any specific labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  10. Would you prefer any specific margin or padding around the chart elements?'
