initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the production of craft beer from
  2009 for different brewer sizes. Plot 'total_barrels' on the y-axis and 'year' on
  the x-axis, separating data points by 'brewer_size'. Use text annotations to display
  'n_of_brewers' on each data point to highlight key differences. Include highlights
  to emphasize data points with missing values in 'total_barrels' and 'total_shipped'.
  This will help in understanding the trends in production volume across various brewer
  sizes and years, with special attention to potential data irregularities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between various
  ''brewer_size'' categories?

  2. Should the text annotations indicating ''n_of_brewers'' be of any specific font
  size or style?

  3. How would you prefer to highlight the data points with missing values in ''total_barrels''
  and ''total_shipped''?

  4. Do you prefer any specific marker shapes for the scatter plot data points?

  5. Are there any particular labels, titles, or legends you want included? For example,
  the title of the chart or axis labels.

  6. Should the axis range be manually set or automatically determined based on data?

  7. Do you have any preference regarding the gridlines on the chart (e.g., visibility,
  style)?

  8. Would you like a trend line or any form of regression line to be included in
  the scatter plot?

  9. Are there any specific brewer size categories you would like highlighted or emphasized
  more than others?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer a different color or marker shape to highlight data points with
  missing values.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a title "Craft Beer Production from 2009 by Brewer Size",
  and axis labels "Year" for the x-axis and "Total Barrels" for the y-axis. Also,
  include a legend for the ''brewer_size'' categories.
