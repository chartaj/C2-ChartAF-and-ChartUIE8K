initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the distribution of 'total_barrels'
  from 2009 to 2019, categorized by 'brewer_size'. Highlight the '6,000,001 Barrels
  and Over' and '1,000,001 to 6,000,000 Barrels' categories to emphasize the larger
  production scales. Add text annotations indicating key data points for 'total_barrels'
  and 'taxable_removals'. This visualization will help to understand the production
  scale and tax contributions of different brewer sizes in the craft beer industry.
  Ensure the chart is clear and focuses on the significant differences in production
  volumes among various brewer sizes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram categories,
  especially for the highlighted brewer sizes?

  2. Would you like the histogram to display counts or percentages?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations to be placed on the chart?

  clear?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text annotations
  and labels?

  6. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  7. Is there any specific title you want to give to the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the bin width or the number of bins in the histogram?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the chart? If so, in which orientation
  (e.g., both horizontal and vertical, just horizontal)?'
