initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the wine dataset provided. The histogram
  should visualize the distribution of wine points. Each bin should represent a point
  range (e.g., 80-82, 83-85, etc.). Additionally, please provide color differentiation
  based on the wine's price range. This will help in understanding the correlation
  between wine quality (points) and price. Include labels for both axes and a legend
  to clarify the price ranges used. Make sure the histogram is easy to read and interpret
  for casual wine enthusiasts and buyers. Thank you!
questions: '1. What title would you like for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for differentiating the price ranges?

  3. Are there any specific point ranges (other than the suggested 80-82, 83-85, etc.)
  you would like to use for the bins?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range or limit for the price differentiation (e.g.,
  low, medium, high price)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the histogram?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the style of the legend (e.g., placement, font
  size)?

  7. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and title?'
