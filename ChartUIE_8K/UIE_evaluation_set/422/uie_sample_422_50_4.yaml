initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of wine points from
  the dataset. Compare it with the price distribution to understand if higher-priced
  wines receive better scores.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?\n\
  2. Would you like both distributions (points and price) to be displayed in the same\
  \ plot or in separate plots?\n3. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the histograms?\n\
  4. Should the histograms be displayed with a specific orientation (vertical or horizontal)?\n\
  5. Would you like any additional statistical measures (mean, median, etc.) to be\
  \ overlaid on the histograms?\n6. Do you want any annotations or labels on the histograms\
  \ to highlight specific data points or ranges?\n7. Would you like a secondary axis\
  \ to be used for the price distribution if both are displayed in the same plot?\n\
  8. How would you like the data to be grouped if there are any specific groupings\
  \ you want? \n9. Do you have any preferences for the title, axis labels, or legend\
  \ descriptions for the histograms?"
