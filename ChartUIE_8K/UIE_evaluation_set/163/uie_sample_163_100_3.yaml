initial_prompt: Please create a histogram displaying the distribution of unique values
  in the column "Broadband availability in the United States based on the FCC." As
  the data is focused on broadband mapping across counties in the U.S., this visualization
  should help analyze the frequency of different broadband availability statuses.
  Use appropriate axis labels to reflect the count of unique values and categorize
  them as per the broadband data. Ensure the histogram is clear and accurately represents
  the given dataset and highlights areas with varying availability of broadband services.
  This will help in understanding the spread and concentration of broadband services.
  Thank you!
