  Create a bar chart showcasing broadband availability across US counties. Use the
  ''Broadband availability in the United States based on the FCC'' column for availability
  data. Annotate key values to highlight counties with the highest and lowest availability,
  drawing attention to outliers. The chart should emphasize the disparities in broadband
  access. Include text annotations for counties with particularly low availability
  to provide context. Utilize color highlights to distinguish between high, average,
  and low availability counties. The chart aims to provide a clear overview of where
  broadband coverage is sufficient and where improvements are needed.
