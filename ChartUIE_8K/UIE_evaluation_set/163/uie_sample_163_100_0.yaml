initial_prompt: Create a geographical heatmap to visualize broadband availability
  across counties in the United States. Highlight areas with the highest and lowest
  broadband access. Use annotations to indicate noteworthy trends or regions with
  particularly high or low availability. The map should effectively distinguish high-access
  areas from low-access ones using color coding. Utilize available data columns to
  create this visualization. The purpose is to focus attention on broadband distribution
  and identify areas needing improvement or further analysis. Ensure the chart is
  clear, informative, and provides valuable insights into the broadband landscape
  across the country.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for highlighting high-access
  and low-access areas on the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific regions or counties to be emphasized or annotated
  beyond those identified as extremes?

  3. Do you have preferred annotations styles or symbols for highlighting noteworthy
  trends or regions?

  4. Should the heatmap include any additional layers or markers, such as population
  density or demographic information?

  5. Is there a particular map projection that you prefer for representing the United
  States?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.
