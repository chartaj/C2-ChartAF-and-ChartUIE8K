initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing broadband availability by county
  in the United States, based on the given data. Highlight counties with varying broadband
  availability to depict disparities. Use text annotations to point out areas with
  extreme low or high availability, providing crucial context. Ensure the map focuses
  on identifying broadband black spots and well-connected areas. This visualization
  serves to direct attention to critical regions needing infrastructure improvement.
  Annotations must emphasize important disparities, and colors should distinctly reflect
  different levels of broadband access across counties for clear visual communication.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for depicting different levels
  of broadband access?

  2. Are there specific color codes you want to use for extreme low and high broadband
  availability?

  3. Should the text annotations include specific statistics or just highlight the
  areas of interest?

  4. Are there any particular counties or regions that you want to be prominently
  annotated?

  5. Should the map include additional geographical features, such as state boundaries
  or major cities?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations?

  7. Is there any specific layout or orientation for the choropleth map that you prefer?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or key to explain the color coding of broadband
  availability levels?

  9. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the map
  for clarity?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the map projection to be used in the visualization?'
