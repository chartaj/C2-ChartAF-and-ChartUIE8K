initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize water quality data for region LV-SW-012
  over time. Focus on the relationship between pollution index, water temperature,
  and ammonia nitrogen levels. Highlight points where pollution index exceeds 20 with
  a distinct color to draw attention to higher pollution levels. Add text annotations
  for these highlighted points to display exact values of pollution index, water temp,
  and ammonia nitrogen. This will help in understanding the peak pollution periods
  and their corresponding water parameters. Use different shapes or colors for varying
  water quality levels to add context. Ensure the plot is easy to interpret for environmental
  monitoring.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting points where
  pollution index exceeds 20?

  2. What specific shapes or colors would you like to use for varying water quality
  levels?

  3. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Are there any axis labels or titles that you would like to be added to the chart?

  5. How detailed would you like the time axis to be (e.g., hourly, daily, etc.)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or design of the scatter plot?

  7. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like to include to explain different
  shapes or colors used?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the scatter plot? If so, which gridlines
  (horizontal, vertical, or both)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please add axis labels and a title.

  5. I would prefer the time axis to be detailed daily.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain different shapes or colors used.

  8. Yes, display both horizontal and vertical gridlines.'
