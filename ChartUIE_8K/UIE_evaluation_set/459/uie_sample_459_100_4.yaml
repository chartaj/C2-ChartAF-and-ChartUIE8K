initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart visualizing water quality metrics over
  time for region LV-SW-012. The x-axis should represent the Time in hours, and y-axis
  should display values for Pollution Index, Water Temp, Ammonia Nitrogen, Hosphorus,
  and Dissolved Oxygen. Each metric should have a separate line for clear comparison.
  Include a legend to differentiate lines. Use different colors for each line and
  ensure the chart is easy to read. Data to be used is from multiple time points,
  specifically: ''2020/3/1 00:00:00'', ''2020/3/1 04:00:00'', ''2020/3/1 08:00:00''.
  Highlight trends and variations. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the lines?

  2. Do you prefer the lines to be solid, dashed, or a mixture of both?

  3. Should the chart include markers at each data point?

  4. What font style and size would you like for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you have a preference for the gridlines (e.g., visible, dotted, or none)?

  6. Would you like to include a title or subtitle for the chart? If yes, please specify.

  7. Should the y-axis have a set range, or should it be auto-scaled based on the
  data?

  8. Do you prefer the chart background to be white, colored, or transparent?

  9. Would you like to highlight specific data points or trends with annotations?
  If so, please specify.'
