initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the provided data to visualize the
  distribution of the Pollution Index, Water Temp, Ammonia Nitrogen, and Dissolved
  Oxygen levels. Display each metric on separate box charts for clear comparison.
  Highlight any potential outliers and ensure the x-axis shows the different time
  intervals. Use different colors for each parameter to differentiate them easily.
  These insights will help analyze water quality over time in Region LV-SW-012 and
  determine any significant deviations or patterns in the recorded measurements. Thank
  you.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different parameters
  (Pollution Index, Water Temp, Ammonia Nitrogen, Dissolved Oxygen)?

  2. Is there a specific time interval format you would like for the x-axis labels
  (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the style or size of the box charts (e.g., width
  of boxes, spacing between them)?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines to make the comparison of values across
  time intervals easier?

  5. Are there any specific statistical measures (e.g., mean, median) that you would
  like to highlight on the box charts?

  6. Do you have preferences for the font style or size of the labels and titles on
  the charts?

  7. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color to make them easily
  identifiable?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include grid lines.

  5. Could you highlight the median?

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, please mark the outliers with a specific symbol or color to make them easily
  identifiable.'
