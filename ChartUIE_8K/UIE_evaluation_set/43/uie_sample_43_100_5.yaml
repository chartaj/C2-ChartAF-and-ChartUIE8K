initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the Blood Dataset to visualize the
  relationship between Recency, Frequency, and Monetary against Time. The x-axis should
  represent the Time and the y-axis should represent either Recency, Frequency, or
  Monetary, with points differentiated by the Class. Ensure clear labels and a legend
  for ease of understanding, highlighting any noticeable patterns in the health data
  between regular donors and non-regular donors. This visualization will help understand
  the recency, frequency, and monetary contribution patterns over different time intervals
  for different donor classes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or palettes for differentiating
  the data points by ''Class''?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart?

  3. Is there a specific style or font you prefer for labels and legends?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the shape or size of the data points?

  5. Should the axes have specific scales or should they be automatically determined
  based on the data?

  6. Would you like to add any specific annotations or labels to highlight key patterns
  or points in the data?

  7. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like to include for the scatter
  plot?

  8. Do you prefer the legend to be placed at a specific location within the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color schemes.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines.

  3. I have no specific preference for the style or font.

  4. I am not sure about the shape or size of the data points.

  5. The axes should be automatically determined based on the data.

  6. I do not know about adding specific annotations or labels.

  7. Please title it "Blood Donation Patterns by Donor Class".

  8. I am not sure about the legend placement.'
