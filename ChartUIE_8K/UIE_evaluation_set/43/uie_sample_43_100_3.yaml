initial_prompt: I have a health dataset related to blood donations, and I want to
  visualize some aspects of it to get better insights. Please create a box chart for
  the dataset that specifically examines the distribution of the 'Recency', 'Frequency',
  'Monetary', and 'Time' columns. It's important to capture the spread and possible
  outliers in these columns since they can help understand donors' behavior and contribution
  tendencies. Make sure the chart is labeled clearly for each column and provides
  a good comparison across these different dimensions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart?

  4. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plots?

  5. Would you like to see additional statistical details (such as mean and median
  lines) on the box chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the scale or range of the y-axis for each box
  plot?

  7. Are there any specific gridlines or background styles you prefer for the chart?'
