initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the Blood Dataset from the health
  category. Plot 'Time' on the x-axis and 'Monetary' on the y-axis to track spending
  over time for different persons. Add text annotations to highlight key data points,
  such as peaks and troughs in the curve. Use highlights to distinguish the 'Class'
  categories (1 and 0) by changing line colors. This will help in understanding trends
  in spending patterns and their correlation with different classes. The visualization
  aims to provide insights into how spending fluctuates over time and its relation
  to recency, frequency, and class.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between the
  ''Class'' categories?

  2. What style of line do you prefer (solid, dashed, dotted) for the chart?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations to be placed for highlighted data
  points (above, below, or beside the points)?

  4. Do you have any preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart? If so, should they be for
  both x-axis and y-axis or just one?

  6. Do you have a specific range or scale you want for the y-axis (Monetary values)?

  7. Would you like to include markers on the line chart for each data point? If yes,
  what style of markers do you prefer (circle, square, triangle)?

  8. How would you like the legend to be displayed (right, bottom, top, etc.)?

  9. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If so, do you have a preferred title?

  10. Are there any specific labels you would like to use for the x-axis and y-axis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Solid lines are fine.

  3. Above the points would be good.

  4. I do not have any specific preference.

  5. Yes, include gridlines for both x-axis and y-axis.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, add markers. Circle markers are preferred.

  8. I would like the legend to be displayed at the bottom.

  9. Yes, the title could be "Spending Patterns Over Time".

  10. "Time" for the x-axis and "Monetary" for the y-axis.'
