initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the Ethereum Cryptocurrency
  Historical Dataset. Use the data provided to show the daily closing prices, open
  prices, and trading volumes over a specific period. Each bar should represent a
  different date, and the heights should depict the corresponding prices and volumes.
  Ensure that the x-axis denotes the dates, while the y-axis represents the values
  (Price and Vol). Also, differentiate the Price, Open, and Vol categories with different
  colors for clarity. The chart should help identify trends and fluctuations in Ethereum's
  market performance. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different categories (Price,
  Open, and Vol)?

  2. What specific date range would you like the bar chart to cover?

  3. How would you like the data points to be sorted on the x-axis (e.g., chronological
  order, reverse chronological order)?

  4. Is there a preferred y-axis scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) you would like
  to use?

  5. Do you prefer a specific bar width or spacing between bars?

  6. Are there any specific gridline preferences you have for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include annotations or labels on the bars to show exact values?

  (e.g., minimalist, detailed, modern)?'
