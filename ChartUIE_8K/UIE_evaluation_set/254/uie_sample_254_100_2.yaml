initial_prompt: Create a candlestick chart to visualize Ethereum's historical cryptocurrency
  prices using the provided data. Highlight significant price changes utilizing text
  annotations, especially where there's a notable percentage change in price. Use
  highlights to emphasize date ranges with the highest and lowest prices. This visualization
  aims to help investors quickly identify trends and make informed decisions. Ensure

  movements, drawing attention to key data points.
