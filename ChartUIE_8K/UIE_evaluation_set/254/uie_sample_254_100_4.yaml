initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing Ethereum cryptocurrency historical data
  with columns such as Date, Price, Open, High, Low, Vol, and Change %. Iâ€™d like a
  box plot for the Price and Open columns to understand the central tendency and variability.
  The x-axis should represent these columns, and the y-axis should represent the value
  in USD. This should help to visualize the distribution and outliers in the Price
  and Open data over time. Ensure the chart is clear, with well-labeled axes and title
  for easy interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the box plot?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color scheme for the box plot?

  3. Should the whiskers of the box plot extend to the minimum and maximum values,
  or to a specific percentile range (e.g., 1.5 IQR)?

  4. Do you want data points to be displayed on the box plot to highlight outliers?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the labels on the
  x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the plot?

  7. Should the background of the plot be a particular style or color (e.g., gridlines,
  solid color)?

  8. Do you need a legend to differentiate between the ''Price'' and ''Open'' columns,
  or is it clear enough without one?

  9. Are there any specific formats or units for the y-axis labels that you prefer
  (e.g., comma-separated for thousands)?'
