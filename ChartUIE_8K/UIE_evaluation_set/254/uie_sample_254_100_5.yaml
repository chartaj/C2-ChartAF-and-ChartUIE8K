initial_prompt: I am analyzing historical data of the Ethereum cryptocurrency from
  the dataset. I want to create an area chart that visualizes the changes in Price
  over time. The x-axis should represent the Date, and the y-axis should show the
  Price. Ensure that the prices are formatted correctly to handle the commas. Highlight
  significant peaks and troughs to give a clear overview of the price fluctuation.
  Use different shades to represent different levels of prices in the area chart,
  making it easy to identify trends and patterns over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette or color scheme preference for
  the different shades representing different levels of prices?

  2. Would you like the chart to display exact price values on hover or directly on
  the chart?

  3. Is there a preference for the format of the date on the x-axis (e.g., ''MM/DD/YYYY'',
  ''YYYY-MM-DD'')?

  4. Should weekends or non-trading days be displayed or hidden on the time axis?

  5. Are there any specific peak or trough values that you want to highlight with
  annotations or markers?

  6. Do you prefer any specific labeling style for the y-axis to handle large price
  values, such as using abbreviations (e.g., ''K'' for thousands)?

  7. Should the significant peaks and troughs be visually distinguished with different
  shapes or colors?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to explain the different shades of the area chart?

  9. Is there a specific range for the y-axis that you want to focus on, or should
  it adjust dynamically based on the data?

  10. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart for
  better readability?'
