initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the week
  position and weeks on chart for Christmas songs that made it to the Billboard charts.
  Each point should represent a song and be color-coded by the performer. Additionally,
  include data labels for the peak positions. Please use the provided data fields
  like song, performer, week_position, and weeks_on_chart. This will help visualize
  how long each Christmas song stayed on the chart relative to its position. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette to be used
  for the performers?

  2. Would you like the data labels for peak positions to be always visible or only
  on hover?

  3. Is there a preferred size for the data points on the scatter plot?

  4. Should the axes have a specific range, or should they auto-scale based on the
  data?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the background to help with value interpretation?

  6. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Should there be a legend explaining the color coding by performer, or is it unnecessary?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis labels text?

  9. Would you like to include a trend line in the scatter plot to illustrate the
  correlation?

  10. Are there any specific annotations you would like to add besides peak positions?'
