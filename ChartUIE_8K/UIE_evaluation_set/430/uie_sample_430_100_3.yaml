initial_prompt: I have data showing various Christmas songs charting on the Billboard
  Hot 100, including song titles, performer names, their chart positions, peak positions,
  and weeks on the chart. I'd like to see a stacked bar chart that visualizes the
  chart performance over the weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. Specifically, I want
  to compare different songs by their peak positions over time. Include all provided
  data points like week position, performer, and other relevant metrics. Please ensure
  the chart is visually appealing and easy to interpret for a general audience.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Should we include a legend in the chart to distinguish between different songs
  and performers?

  3. Do you prefer a specific arrangement for the bars (e.g., sorted by song title,
  peak position, or another attribute)?

  4. Would you like to see data labels on the bars, such as week position or peak
  position values?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines to enhance readability?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or comments on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, do you have
  specific wording in mind?

  9. Should there be specific focus or highlight on certain songs or time periods
  in the chart?'
