initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the given dataset that visualizes the
  relationships between Average Temperature, Population, Area, GDP, and Continent.
  The heatmap should show how these variables correlate with each other across different
  continents. This visualization will help identify patterns or trends among the continents
  in terms of temperature, population, area size, and economic indicators. Use the
  data provided and ensure clear labels and a legend for easy interpretation. Make
  sure that missing values, if any, are handled appropriately. The heatmap should
  be visually clear and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used in the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include numerical values within the cells to show exact correlation
  coefficients?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to use a specific range for the correlation coefficients
  (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  4. Do you want the heatmap to display the data in a particular order (e.g., alphabetical
  order of continents)?

  5. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Do you want to include annotations for significant correlations or trends?

  7. Should the legend be displayed in a specific position (left, right, top, bottom)?

  8. Would you like to add titles or subtitles for additional context in the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap follow a specific grid layout or spacing between cells?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include numerical values within the cells to show exact correlation
  coefficients.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should use a specific range for the correlation coefficients,
  from -1 to 1.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include titles or subtitles for additional context in the heatmap.

  9. I do not know.'
