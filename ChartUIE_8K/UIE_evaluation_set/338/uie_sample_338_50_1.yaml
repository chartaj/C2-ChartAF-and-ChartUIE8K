initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize ProductionVolume and DefectRate. Annotate
  key points to highlight high defect rates and significant outliers, and use color
  to differentiate between various production volumes. This will help in identifying
  patterns and problem areas in the manufacturing process.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating between various
  production volumes?

  2. Do you have any specific labels or annotations you want to add to highlight high
  defect rates and significant outliers?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included in the box plot?

  4. Is there a specific range for the axes that you would like to set for better
  visualization?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the box plot style (e.g., classic, modern,
  minimalistic)?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  7. Are there any additional elements you would like to emphasize on the plot, such
  as median lines or quartile markers?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers for threshold values?'
