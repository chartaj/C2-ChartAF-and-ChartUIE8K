initial_prompt: I'd like a stacked bar chart visualization of the "Predicting Manufacturing
  Defects" dataset, specifically focusing on comparing the "DefectRate" across different
  "ProductionVolume" categories. Could you stack the bar chart by "SupplierQuality"
  and "DeliveryDelay" so I can easily see how these factors contribute to defect rates?
  Make sure the chart has labels and a legend to differentiate the supplier quality
  and delivery delay contributions. This will help us understand the relationship
  between production volume and defect rates better, considering supplier quality
  and delivery delays. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors that you prefer for the different categories
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to represent specific intervals of production volume,
  such as ranges or individual values?

  3. How would you like the y-axis to be scaled? Should it be a percentage or an absolute
  value?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order in which the "SupplierQuality" and "DeliveryDelay"
  are stacked within each bar?

  5. Are there any specific labels or descriptions you want to include alongside the
  axes, or are default labels sufficient?

  6. Would you prefer grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and legend?

  8. Do you need any data points or values to be highlighted or emphasized in the
  chart?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart for additional
  context?'
