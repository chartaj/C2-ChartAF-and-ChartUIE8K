initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing 'DefectRate' across different 'ProductionVolume'
  values. Use text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest defect rates. Highlight
  bars to emphasize significant differences. Aim to identify trends and potential
  areas for quality improvement in manufacturing processes. Consider safety and efficiency
  metrics for comprehensive analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the bars
  with significant differences?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted by ''ProductionVolume'' or ''DefectRate''?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or subtitle?

  6. Should we include axis labels, and if so, do you have specific text for those
  labels?

  7. Are there any specific safety and efficiency metrics you would like to see included
  or referenced in the chart?

  8. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for this bar chart?'
