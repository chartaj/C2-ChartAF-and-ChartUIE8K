initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart showing the total sales for each
  city with different sub-categories stacked within each city. Use the data provided
  in the Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset. The x-axis should represent
  the cities, and the y-axis should represent total sales. Each stacked color should
  denote a different sub-category to help visualize the sales contributions of each
  sub-category within every city. This will help us analyze the sales distribution
  across various cities and sub-categories within the retail grocery business.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different sub-categories?

  2. Should the cities on the x-axis be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetically,
  by total sales)?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on the bars to show the exact sales figures?

  4. Do you have a preference for the width of the columns in the chart?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size that you want to be used for labels
  and titles?

  7. Do you want to add a title to the chart, and if yes, what should it be?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specific range, or should it auto-adjust based on the
  data?'
