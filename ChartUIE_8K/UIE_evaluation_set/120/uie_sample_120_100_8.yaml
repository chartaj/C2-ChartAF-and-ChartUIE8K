initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map visualizing the Supermart Grocery Sales
  data. The map should show the profit distribution across different cities in Tamil
  Nadu. Highlight the cities based on profit levels using a gradient color scale to
  represent higher and lower profits. Include tooltips to display additional details
  such as sales, discount, and order date when hovering over each city. The map should
  clearly indicate city boundaries and provide a legend for easy interpretation of
  the color scale. This will help in understanding regional performance and identifying
  high-profit areas.

  to represent profit levels?

  in the tooltips?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or shape of the map and its
  elements?

  7. Are there any additional details or metrics you''d like to include in the tooltips
  apart from sales, discount, and order date?'
