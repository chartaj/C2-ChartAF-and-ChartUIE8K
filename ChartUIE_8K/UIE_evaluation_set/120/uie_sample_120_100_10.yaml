initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between Sales, Discount,
  and Profit across various regions and cities using the Supermart Grocery Sales dataset.
  Include data for all sub-categories and order dates. The heatmap should highlight
  areas with higher sales and profit, indicating successful product categories and
  regional preferences. Additionally, ensure that the data labels clearly indicate
  the values in each cell, making it easy to identify trends and outliers. This will
  help in understanding which regions and product categories perform better, aiding
  in strategic decision-making for inventory and marketing.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap to distinguish different
  value ranges?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the color scale (e.g., gradient, discrete)?

  3. Should the heatmap display only the absolute values, or should it also show percentage
  changes?

  4. How would you like to handle potential outliers in the data?

  5. Do you want to add any reference lines or markers to highlight specific thresholds?

  6. Would you prefer any particular font style or size for the data labels within
  the heatmap cells?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  8. Should the regions and cities be grouped or sorted in a specific order?

  9. Do you prefer any specific format for the date labels (e.g., month-year, full
  date)?

  10. Are there any specific sub-categories that should be highlighted or given particular
  emphasis?

  11. How granular should the data be? Should it be aggregated to a certain level
  (e.g., monthly, quarterly)?

  12. Do you want any additional annotations or tooltips to provide context when hovering
  over specific cells?'
