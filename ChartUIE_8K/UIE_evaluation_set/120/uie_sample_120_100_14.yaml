initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize Supermart Grocery Sales. Use 'City'
  on the x-axis and plot 'Sales' and 'Profit' on the y-axis. Differentiate the 'Category'
  by color. Ensure each cityâ€™s sales and profit are side-by-side to easily compare
  them. Use the first few cities as samples. Include a legend to identify categories,
  sales, and profit clearly. Make sure the chart is titled "Grocery Sales and Profit
  by City and Category". Provide a clear axis label to understand the data breakdown
  comprehensively. This helps in comparing sales performance and profitability across
  different cities and categories.
