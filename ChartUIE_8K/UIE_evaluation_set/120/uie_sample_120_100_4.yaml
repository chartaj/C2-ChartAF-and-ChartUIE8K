initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the sales distribution across
  different regions in the Supermart Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset. I want
  to see how sales, along with profits and discounts, vary in the North, South, West,
  and any other regions provided in the data. This will help understand the spread
  and central tendency of sales and associated metrics in each region. Make sure to
  label the axes properly, with sales, profit, and discount values on the y-axis and
  regions on the x-axis. Include any outliers in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend that distinguishes between sales, profit,
  and discount in the chart?

  3. Do you prefer to have the outliers marked in any specific way (e.g., asterisks,
  dots)?

  4. Is there a specific sorting order you would like for the regions on the x-axis?

  5. Should the y-axis use a logarithmic scale or a linear scale?

  6. Would you like to display the median values of sales, profits, and discounts
  prominently on the chart?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and text in
  the chart?

  8. Do you want grid lines for better readability of data points?

  9. Would you like to display any summary statistics (e.g., mean, quartiles) on the
  chart?

  10. Should the chart include annotations or callouts for any specific data insights?'
