initial_prompt: Please create an area chart using the provided stock prices data for
  the META stock. The x-axis should represent the date, and the y-axis should show
  the closing prices ("Close"). Include data-driven text annotations for key dates
  where significant changes in stock prices occurred. Additionally, highlight periods
  of high and low trading volume to emphasize these trends. Ensure the chart is clear
  and easy to understand for a financial analysis presentation. The chart should provide
  context and insights into how the stock price has fluctuated over time.

  and annotations?
