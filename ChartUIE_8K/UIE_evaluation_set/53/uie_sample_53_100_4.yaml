initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the 'Close' prices from the provided
  META stock historical prices dataset. The histogram should show the distribution
  of closing prices over the given dates. This will help visualize how often the stock
  closes at different price ranges, providing insight into price stability and volatility.
  Use bins that appropriately represent the data range to capture significant price
  variations without losing detail. Additionally, the histogram should have labeled
  axes, with the x-axis representing the closing price ranges and the y-axis representing
  the frequency of those prices.
questions: '1. What specific color scheme or palette would you prefer for the histogram
  bars?

  2. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram, or should it be auto-calculated
  based on the data range?

  3. Should the histogram include a title? If so, please provide the title text.

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you prefer to have grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include additional information such as units
  or a brief description?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or markers on the histogram to highlight
  certain data ranges or values?

  8. Would you like the histogram to display the frequency count at the top of each
  bar for clarity?

  9. Do you have any preference regarding the aspect ratio or dimensions of the histogram?

  10. Should the chart include a legend, even if there is only one data series?
