initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart showing the daily trading volume and closing
  price of META stock over a week in January 2018. Please use the 'Volume' and 'Close'
  columns for the y-axes and the 'Date' column for the x-axis. Separate bars for each
  metric and make sure dates are in order. Include labels and a legend. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing the
  volume and the closing price?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a specific format for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g., ''YYYY-MM-DD'')?

  4. Would you prefer the volume and closing price bars to be displayed side-by-side
  or layered on the same bar?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and legend?

  6. Do you want any specific title for the chart?

  7. Would you like the axis labels to include additional information, such as units
  (e.g., ''Volume (in millions)'')?

  8. Are there any specific data points you want to highlight within the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart for additional
  context?'
