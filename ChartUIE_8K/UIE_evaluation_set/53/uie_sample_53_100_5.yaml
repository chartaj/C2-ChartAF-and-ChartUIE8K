initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the historical prices of META stock
  from the data provided. The x-axis should represent the 'Date' while the y-axis
  should plot 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices across the time period. Highlight
  any significant peaks and dips in the stock prices. Ensure that the chart is easy
  to read with different lines for each type of price (Open, High, Low, Close) and
  include a legend for clarity. This should help me understand the stock's performance
  over time. Please use the detailed data to create the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart lines representing
  ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', and ''Close'' prices?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability, and if so, in which
  direction (horizontal, vertical, or both)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific format for the ''Date'' axis labels (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD,
  MM/DD/YYYY)?

  4. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?

  5. Would you like to include annotations or markers specifically for the significant
  peaks and dips?

  6. How detailed should the legend be? Do you prefer it positioned in a specific
  location on the chart (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like to give to the chart, or should it simply
  state ''Historical Prices of META Stock''?'
