initial_prompt: Can you create a candlestick chart for the META stock historical prices
  data from the file 53.csv? I want the chart to display the Date on the x-axis and
  the Open, High, Low, and Close prices on the y-axis. Please ensure the candlesticks
  accurately represent the daily stock price movements using the provided sample data.
  The chart should help visualize the stock's performance. I am especially interested
  in looking at the price trends over the recorded period. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the candlesticks representing
  the stock price movements?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for easier reading of the data
  points?

  3. Should the chart include any specific annotations or markers for key dates or
  events?

  4. Do you prefer to have volume data displayed as an additional plot below the candlestick
  chart?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges or periods you would like to highlight within
  the chart?

  6. Would you like the chart to include axis titles and labels with any specific
  formatting?

  7. Should the chart have a legend explaining the different price points (Open, High,
  Low, Close)?

  8. Do you want to include any trend lines or moving averages to further illustrate
  the price trends?

  9. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size preference for the chart?

  10. Would you prefer a background color or a standard white background for the chart?'
