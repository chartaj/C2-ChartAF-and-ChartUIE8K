initial_prompt: Create a histogram chart to visualize the distribution of the 'Video
  Count' for the top 1000 YouTube channels in the world. I want to see how frequently
  different ranges of video counts appear across these popular channels. Focus on
  representing the data from the 'Video Count' column, and include labels for the
  x-axis (Number of Videos) and y-axis (Number of Channels). Additionally, it would
  be interesting to see how the 'Category' might contribute to the distribution, so
  consider a color-coding scheme to indicate different categories. Keep it simple
  and intuitive.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different categories
  in the histogram?

  2. How many bins would you like to use for the histogram representation of ''Video
  Count''?

  3. Do you want grid lines in the background to enhance readability?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to clarify the color-coding scheme for categories?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Should the histogram include any specific annotations or markers to highlight
  certain ranges or data points?'
