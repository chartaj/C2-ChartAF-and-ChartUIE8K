initial_prompt: Create a Donut chart for the "Top 1000 YouTube Channels in the World
  üåêüìäüé•" with categories as segments. Emphasize segments with the highest subscribers.
  Annotate the chart with a few top channels from each category, showing their subscriber
  counts. The chart should highlight how different categories like Entertainment,
  Music, and Film & Animation contribute to the total subscriber base. Additionally,
  indicate the amount of video views for context where applicable. Ensure the visualization
  draws attention to the distribution of categories and the prominence of top YouTubers
  in each.
