initial_prompt: Please create a column chart based on the dataset titled "Top 1000
  YouTube Channels in the World." The chart should display the top 10 YouTube channels,
  showing their 'Subscribers' count on the Y-axis and the channelsâ€™ names on the X-axis.
  Use different colors for each bar to represent the 'Category' each channel belongs
  to. This visualization will help to compare the subscriber count and initial category
  distribution among these top channels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used for
  different categories?

  2. Would you like to include data labels showing the exact subscriber count on each
  bar?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the category legend (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  4. Should the chart have gridlines for better readability, and if so, should they
  be on the Y-axis, X-axis, or both?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like to see any additional information in the chart''s tooltip (e.g.,
  starting year, video views)?

  7. Is there a specific order you would like the YouTube channels to be displayed
  in other than by rank (e.g., alphabetical order)?

  8. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the chart, and if so, what should
  they be?'
