initial_prompt: I have data on Spotify song attributes, specifically their characteristics
  like danceability, energy, and duration. I'd like to create a pie chart that shows
  the distribution of songs by artist. The chart should break down the percentage
  of songs each artist contributes to the dataset. This will help me understand which
  artists have the most songs in the collection. Please use the "artist" column for
  categorization and ensure that each slice represents an artist's portion of the
  total songs. This should give a clear visualization of artist representation within
  the given dataset.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart slices?\n\
  2. Would you like to display the artist names directly on the chart slices or in\
  \ a legend?\n3. Should the percentages be displayed on the pie chart slices?\n4.\
  \ Do you have a preferred title for the pie chart?\n5. How many artists would you\
  \ like to display? Should less frequent artists be grouped into an \"Others\" category?\
  \ \n6. Do you want to include the exact count of songs per artist along with the\
  \ percentage?\n7. Is there a specific order you would like the artists to be displayed\
  \ in, such as by descending order of their song count?"
