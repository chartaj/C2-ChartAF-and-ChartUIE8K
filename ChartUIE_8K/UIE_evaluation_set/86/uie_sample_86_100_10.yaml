initial_prompt: 'I''d like a Heatmap to visualize the correlation between different
  Spotify song attributes. Use attributes like ''acousticness'', ''danceability'',
  ''energy'', ''instrumentalness'', ''liveness'', ''loudness'', ''speechiness'', ''tempo'',
  and ''valence''. The goal is to see how these attributes relate to each other and
  identify any strong or weak correlations. Ensure each attribute is clearly labeled
  on the heatmap and use a color gradient to indicate the strength of correlations:
  darker colors for stronger correlations and lighter colors for weaker ones. Thank
  you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific labels or titles on the heatmap?

  3. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color gradient?

  4. What gridline style or thickness do you prefer, if any, on the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for the labels and titles?

  6. Do you want the heatmap to display exact numerical correlation values within
  each cell?

  7. Would you like the chart to have specific spacing or padding around the plot
  area?

  8. Should there be any annotations or highlights on particular areas of the heatmap?'
