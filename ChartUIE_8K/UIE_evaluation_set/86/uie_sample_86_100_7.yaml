initial_prompt: I want a stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of danceability,
  energy, and acousticness for each listed song in the Spotify dataset. Arrange the
  songs by their title along the x-axis, and stack the danceability, energy, and acousticness
  values for each song on the y-axis. Use different colors for each attribute to make
  it easy to distinguish. The chart should be clear and informative, revealing the
  differences and similarities in these attributes across different songs. Please
  ensure the legend is included and the axes are correctly labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the danceability,
  energy, and acousticness attributes?

  2. Would you like the bars to display attribute values on hover or as labels within
  the stacked bar segments?

  3. How would you prefer the songs to be sorted along the x-axis (alphabetical order,
  by a specific attribute, etc.)?

  4. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend placement or format?

  5. Would you like to include any additional information or annotations on the chart
  (e.g., average values, trend lines)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend
  text?

  7. What size or aspect ratio would you prefer for the chart to ensure clarity?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines'' appearance (e.g., color, thickness,
  dashed or solid lines)?'
