initial_prompt: I'd like a dot plot to visualize Spotify song attributes based on
  the dataset provided. Please plot 'danceability' on the X-axis and 'energy' on the
  Y-axis. Each dot should represent a song, using 'song_title' for labels. Color-code
  the dots by 'target'. This will help identify the relationship between danceability
  and energy for each song and how it correlates with the target attribute. Use a
  clear legend and make sure axes are labeled accordingly. I'd also appreciate tooltips
  for each dot showing 'artist' and 'valence' info when hovered over. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the dot size in the plot?

  2. What color scheme would you like for the color-coding of the ''target'' attribute?

  3. Would you like the X-axis and Y-axis to be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  4. Do you prefer any specific titles or labels for the X-axis and Y-axis beyond
  ''danceability'' and ''energy''?

  5. Should the plot have grid lines for better readability, and if yes, what style
  do you prefer for those grid lines?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size of the labels
  and legend?

  7. Would you like any specific marker shape for the dots representing the songs?'
