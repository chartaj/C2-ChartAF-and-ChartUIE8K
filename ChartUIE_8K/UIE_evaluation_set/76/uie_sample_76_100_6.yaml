initial_prompt: I have CSV data on red wine quality, including attributes like fixed
  acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, and more. I would like a line chart to visualize
  changes in the various chemical properties (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric
  acid, etc.) against the quality scores. This chart should help to identify any trends
  or patterns in the chemical makeup of wine that correlate with its quality. Please
  ensure each chemical property is represented by a different line on the chart for
  clarity and comparison. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing each chemical property?

  2. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style for the lines, such as solid, dashed, or dotted?

  4. Would you like markers on the data points? If yes, what type of markers do you
  prefer?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you want to highlight on the axes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart title and any subtitles?

  7. Would you like to include a legend? If so, should it be placed inside or outside
  the chart?

  8. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the text
  elements (title, axis labels, legend, etc.)?

  9. Is there any supplementary information or annotations you would want to include
  in the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart dimensions or aspect ratio?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. X-axis: Wine Quality, Y-axis: Chemical Properties

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Chart Title: Trends in Chemical Properties of Red Wine by Quality

  7. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure about its placement.

  8. I do not have any specific preferences.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I do not have any specific preferences.'
