initial_prompt: Create a heatmap illustrating the correlation between various chemical
  properties and quality of red wine. Include variables like fixed acidity, volatile
  acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur
  dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each correlation value within the heatmap
  cells?

  3. Should the heatmap display a color bar/legend to indicate the range of correlation
  values?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels (e.g., font size, rotation)?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to the
  heatmap to emphasize certain correlations?

  6. Do you have a specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be visible on the heatmap?

  8. Should there be any specific scaling for the color gradient to emphasize particular
  ranges of correlations?'
