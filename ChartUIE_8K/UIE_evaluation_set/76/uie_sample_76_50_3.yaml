initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to compare the average values of fixed acidity,
  volatile acidity, and citric acid for red wine. Label the x-axis with the chemistry
  parameters and the y-axis with the average values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?

  5. Should the chart include error bars to indicate the variability or standard deviation
  of the average values?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  7. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, even though there are only three
  parameters being compared?

  8. Should the y-axis include a specific range, or would you prefer it to be auto-scaled
  based on the data?

  9. Would you like to display the exact numerical average values on top of each bar?

  10. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be sorted or ordered on the
  x-axis?'
