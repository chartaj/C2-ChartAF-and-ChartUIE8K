initial_prompt: I have a dataset about red wine quality, focusing on various chemistry
  properties like acidity, sugar levels, and sulfur content. Could you create a heatmap
  to visualize the correlations between these variables, showing how each chemical
  property relates to the others and to wine quality? The dataset includes columns
  like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, sulfur
  dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol. Please make the chart easy to read
  and interpret, highlighting any strong correlations with wine quality. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer the color intensity to represent the strength of the correlation?

  3. Do you want specific annotation or labels on the heatmap to show correlation
  values?

  4. Should the heatmap include a color bar to explain the correlation values?

  5. Do you want the heatmap cells to be square or rectangular?

  6. Should the correlation values only be shown for strong correlations (e.g., above
  a certain threshold)?

  7. Are there any specific variables you want to focus on or highlight more prominently?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels?

  9. Would you like to include gridlines to separate the cells in the heatmap?'
