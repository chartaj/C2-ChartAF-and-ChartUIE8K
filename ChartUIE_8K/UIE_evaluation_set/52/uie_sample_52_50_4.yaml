  such as price, speed, hd, ram, and screen for computer data.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the color gradient (e.g., two-tone, multi-tone)?

  3. Would you like to display exact correlation values within the heatmap cells?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the heatmap for better separation of cells?

  5. Should any specific ranges or thresholds be highlighted within the heatmap?

  6. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to add axis titles to the heatmap? If so, do you have specific

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (aspect ratio or size)?

  9. Should any specific attributes be given more visual emphasis, such as through
  thicker lines or distinct markers?

  10. Do you require a legend to explain the color gradient used in the heatmap?'
