initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that shows the average price of computers grouped
  by their screen sizes. Use text annotations to display exact average prices on each
  bar for clarity. Highlight bars where the screen size is 15 inches or more to emphasize
  larger screen sizes. This would help in understanding the price variation among
  different screen sizes and could guide users looking to balance cost with display
  size for computer purchases. Utilize the "Basic Computer Data" context for this
  visualization to make it practical and relevant.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. What font type and size would you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the bars for screen sizes 15 inches or more to be highlighted
  (e.g., different color, pattern, bold outline)?

  4. Would you like the y-axis to be labeled, and if so, do you have a specific label
  in mind?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to be displayed in a specific orientation (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical bars)?

  6. Should the bars be arranged in ascending or descending order based on screen
  size or average price?

  7. Is there any additional information you would like to include in the chart (e.g.,
  title, subtitle, legend)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Different color would be fine.

  4. Yes, label it as "Average Price ($)".

  5. I prefer vertical bars.

  6. Arrange them in ascending order based on screen size.

  7. Yes, please include a title "Average Price of Computers by Screen Size" and a
  subtitle "Highlighting Screen Sizes 15 inches or More".'
