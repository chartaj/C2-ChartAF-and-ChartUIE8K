initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various
  features of basic computer data including price, speed, hd, ram, screen, cd, multi,
  premium, ads, and trend. Make sure the heatmap highlights areas of high and low
  correlation in a visually appealing manner. Use distinct color gradients to differentiate
  the levels of correlation. Additionally, ensure that the chart is labeled clearly
  with feature names on both axes and includes a color legend. This will help in understanding
  the relationships between different attributes of the computers and technology data.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients or palettes you prefer for
  the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display exact correlation values within the cells?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the size or dimensions of the heatmap?

  4. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the heatmap
  other than the feature names?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or text within the heatmap cells to
  provide additional context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color gradients or palettes.
