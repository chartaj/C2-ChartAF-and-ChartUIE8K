initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the distribution of computer prices
  based on their different attributes from the provided data. Plot the computer prices
  on the y-axis and the attributes like speed, hard disk size, RAM, screen size, CD
  availability, multi-processor, premium status, advertisement spending, and trend
  on the x-axis. Use different colors to represent each unique value within these
  attributes. This will help to compare and analyze how each attribute affects the
  price of the computers in an easy-to-understand format. Please ensure the chart
  is clear and labeled appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  chart?

  2. What are your preferences for the axis labels and their font sizes?

  3. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (horizontal,
  vertical, angled)?

  5. Should each attribute be grouped or stacked in any particular way?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or data labels you would like to include on
  the chart?

  7. Do you have preferences for the chart title and subtitle, and their styling?'

  6. I do not know about specific annotations or data labels. Use standard ones if
  you think they are helpful.
