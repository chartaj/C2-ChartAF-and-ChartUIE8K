initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing the monthly mean total sunspot numbers
  from 1749 onwards, with columns for date and sunspot number. Could you create a
  radial histogram to visualize the distribution of the sunspot numbers over time?
  Each bin should represent a range of sunspot numbers, and the radius should indicate
  a specific time period. The goal is to understand the sunspot activity patterns
  over time visually. Please include a legend and clear axis labels for better comprehension.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the radial histogram?

  2. What range of sunspot numbers would you like to use for each bin?

  3. How would you like the time periods to be segmented on the radius (e.g., by decade,
  century)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the design of the legend?

  5. Are there any particular axis labels or annotations you would like to include
  for better comprehension?

  6. Would you prefer a specific style or format for the axis labels and ticks?

  7. Is there any additional contextual information or reference lines you''d like
  to add to the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the radial gridlines and their intervals?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. By decade.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Please include axis labels for "Sunspot Number Range" and "Time Period".

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
