initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the 'Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number'
  over time. Use the 'Date' column for the x-axis and 'Monthly Mean Total Sunspot
  Number' for the y-axis. Employ text annotations to highlight specific years where
  sunspot activity was notably high or low. Add color variations to emphasize changes
  in sunspot numbers. The purpose is to analyze long-term trends in solar activity.
  Ensure the visualization is clear and focuses on significant fluctuations in sunspot
  numbers, aiding in space and astronomy studies. Highlight peaks and troughs to make
  them easily identifiable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color scale be sequential or diverging?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for high and low sunspot activity to
  be displayed (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Are there specific years you want to be highlighted for high or low sunspot activity?

  5. What range of dates do you want to focus on for the x-axis?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the heatmap for better readability?

  7. Do you have a preferred format for date labels on the x-axis (e.g., monthly,
  yearly)?

  8. Should there be any labels or legends explaining the color variations?

  9. How detailed should the y-axis labels be for sunspot numbers?

  10. Are there any specific peaks or troughs you already know of that you would like
  to highlight?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Sequential will be fine.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I don''t have specific years in mind.

  5. I am not sure, but maybe the last 100 years.

  6. Yes, showing grid lines would be helpful.

  7. Yearly labels should be good.

  8. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color variations.

  9. Keep it simple but detailed enough to differentiate between significant changes.

  10. I do not know of any specific peaks or troughs.
