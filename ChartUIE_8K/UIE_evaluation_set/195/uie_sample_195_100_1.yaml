initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number
  over time from 1749 to present. Highlight years with significant sunspot activity
  peaks to show solar cycles. Add text annotations on notable peaks, with values displayed.
  This visualization will help understand solar activity trends and cycles. Ensure
  the chart is clear to identify increases or decreases in sunspot numbers over centuries.
  Make use of different colors in the area chart to distinguish between higher and
  lower sunspot numbers effectively. Add non-data-driven annotations for historical
  context around significant solar events.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to distinguish between
  higher and lower sunspot numbers?

  2. Are there specific historical solar events you want to include in the non-data-driven
  annotations for context?

  3. Would you prefer the years with significant sunspot activity peaks to be highlighted
  using a specific color or pattern?

  4. Should the text annotations on notable peaks include any additional information
  besides the values of the sunspot numbers?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the text annotations?

  6. Would you like gridlines or markers to be included to enhance the readability
  of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific time intervals (e.g., decades, centuries) that you would
  like to be marked explicitly on the x-axis?

  8. Do you have a preference for the y-axis scale (linear or logarithmic) to better
  visualize the sunspot number variations?

  9. Is there a specific layout or positioning for the legend that you prefer?

  10. Would you like to include a title and subtitle on the chart, and if so, do you
  have specific wording in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. A specific color to highlight significant years would be nice.

  4. No, just the values of the sunspot numbers.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  7. Decades would be ideal to be marked on the x-axis.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Yes, please include a title and subtitle. Title: "Monthly Mean Total Sunspot
  Number (1749-Present)", Subtitle: "Visualizing Solar Cycles and Significant Solar
  Events".'
