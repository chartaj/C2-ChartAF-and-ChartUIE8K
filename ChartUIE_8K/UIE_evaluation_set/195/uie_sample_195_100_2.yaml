initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing sunspot numbers over time, with
  points representing each month. Highlight periods with exceptionally high or low
  sunspot counts to emphasize trends and unusual activity. Use text annotations to
  display the exact sunspot numbers at specific points, particularly highlighting
