initial_prompt: Please create a chart using an Icon array to visualize the Student
  End of Term Evaluation Survey data. The chart should emphasize the Elective Course
  Satisfaction by using different icons or colors to represent the levels of satisfaction.
  Additionally, include text annotations to highlight key data points like which English
  Lesson Groups had higher satisfaction in elective courses. Use this to draw attention
  to critical elements easily. The aim is to focus on comparative satisfaction across
  different criteria, with visualization aiding interpretation of which factors influence
  student satisfaction the most. This will help in better understanding students'
  preferences and needs.
