initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of "Elective
  Course Satisfaction" across different "English Lesson Groups" from the Student End
  of Term Evaluation Survey data. Include all groups (S17, S06, S13, and others as
  per the data). Ensure that the y-axis represents "Elective Course Satisfaction"
  with values ranging from 0 to 4, and the x-axis shows the "English Lesson Groups."
  The plot should highlight any variations in satisfaction levels among different
  groups. Add median, quartiles, and any outliers. Your assistance is appreciated!
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the box
  plot?

  2. Would you prefer to have labels or annotations on the median, quartiles, and
  outliers?

  3. Do you have a preferred orientation for the x-axis and y-axis labels (e.g., angle,
  font size, font type)?

  4. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability of the data points?

  5. Would you like to add a title and/or subtitle to the box plot? If so, please
  provide the text.

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend, if there is a need for
  one?

  7. How would you like to handle the groups marked as "others"? Should they be aggregated
  into one category or listed separately?

  8. Would you like to customize the whiskers of the box plot in any particular way
  (e.g., by specifying the range covered by the whiskers)?

  9. Do you prefer the outliers to be shown by a specific marker style (e.g., dots,
  stars)?

  10. Are there any additional features or customizations you would like to include
  to enhance the interpretability of the plot?'
