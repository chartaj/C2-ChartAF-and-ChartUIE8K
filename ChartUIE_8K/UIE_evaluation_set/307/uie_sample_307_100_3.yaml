initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart representing the summary data in the Student
  End of Term Evaluation Survey. Each group should correspond to unique English Lesson
  Groups (S17, S06, S13, etc.). Within each group, create bars for 'With Subtitles',
  'Physics Course', 'Microbiology Needs', and 'Elective Courses'. The y-axis should
  show the count of each category. Use different colors to distinguish between the
  categories. Ensure the chart is clear to understand trends and satisfaction across
  the different English Lesson Groups. Please include labels and a legend for clarity.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for colors used to distinguish different
  categories in the bar chart?

  2. Would you like specific fonts or font sizes for the labels and legend?

  3. Do you prefer the bars within each group to be clustered together with spacing,
  or stacked on top of each other?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the categories (''With Subtitles'',
  ''Physics Course'', ''Microbiology Needs'', ''Elective Courses'') to appear within
  each group?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the chart (vertical bars or horizontal
  bars)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart to help with readability?

  7. Is there any specific information or message you would like to highlight in the
  chart?

  8. Are there any other notations or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart for additional clarity or context?'

  2. I do not have any specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  3. I prefer the bars within each group to be clustered together with spacing.

  4. I do not know, any order is fine.

  5. Vertical bars would be fine.

  6. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful for readability.

  7. No, there is no specific information or message to highlight.

  8. I am not sure, just ensure the chart is clear and easy to understand.'
