initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations in the Student End of Term
  Evaluation Survey for variables like "With Subtitles," "Physics Course," "Microbiology
  Needs," and "Elective Course Satisfaction." Use color gradients to highlight relationships
  between different course selections and satisfaction levels.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include axis labels and/or a legend?

  3. Should the heatmap display the correlation values on the cells?

  4. Do you prefer the color gradients to represent positive and negative correlations
  differently?

  5. Is there a specific range of correlation values you would like to emphasize?

  6. Would you like to group certain variables together for better comparison?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and titles?

  8. Should the heatmap include a title or subtitle? If so, what should it be?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include axis labels and a legend.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, group related variables together for better comparison.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, the heatmap should include a title: "Correlation of Course Selections and
  Satisfaction Levels in Student End of Term Evaluation Survey".'
