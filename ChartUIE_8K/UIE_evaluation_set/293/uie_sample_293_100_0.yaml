initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the frequency of different items purchased
  in the online retail dataset. Highlight the items with the highest and lowest frequency
  to draw attention to popular and less common purchases. Annotate each bar with the
  exact count of purchases for clarity. This visualization helps identify consumer
