initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the distribution of products in the
  Online Retail Data Set. Use annotations to highlight categories with missing values

  by color.

  2. How would you like ''Bread'' and ''Cheese'' to be emphasized by color?

  3. Are there any specific categories or data points where you want the annotations
  for missing values to be particularly emphasized?

  4. Would you like the size of the treemap tiles to represent the quantity or frequency
  of the products?

  5. Do you have preferences for font style or size for annotations?

  6. Do you want the treemap to include a legend explaining the color coding and annotations?

  7. How detailed should the annotations be regarding the missing values (e.g., just
  highlight or provide counts of missing values)?

  8. Should ''Bread'' and ''Cheese'' have any additional visual markers aside from
  color (e.g., borders, special icons)?

  9. Do you have preferences for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the treemap?

  10. Would you like to include any context or additional information outside of the
  treemap for interpretation purposes?
