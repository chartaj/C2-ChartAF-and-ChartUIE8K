initial_prompt: Let's create a Treemap chart for the Online Retail Data Set. Each
  node in the treemap will represent a unique product category, with the size of the
  node proportional to the number of transactions. Use the sample data columns (0
  to 6) to highlight important categories such as "Bread," "Wine," and "Cheese" by
  coloring them differently. Annotations will show the number of transactions and
  missing values for each category. The goal of this visualization is to easily identify
  popular product categories and understand data distribution. This is useful for
  business insights and inventory management.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the categories
  ''Bread,'' ''Wine,'' and ''Cheese''?

  2. Would you like a specific font style or size for the annotations showing the
  number of transactions and missing values?

  3. Do you want the treemap chart to have a specific layout (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice,
  strip)?

  4. Should there be any particular ordering of the categories within the treemap?

  5. Are there any additional categories you would like to highlight besides ''Bread,''
  ''Wine,'' and ''Cheese''?

  6. Is there a preference for the chartâ€™s overall color scheme or theme?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding used for the highlighted
  categories?

  8. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the nodes in the treemap (e.g.,
  full category name, abbreviations)?

  9. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  10. Are there any specific preferences for the display of missing values (e.g.,
  indicating them in a particular color or pattern)?'
