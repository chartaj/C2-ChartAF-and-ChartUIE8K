initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the occurrence of different products
  bought together in the online retail dataset. Each cell of the heatmap should represent
  the number of transactions where a combination of two products was purchased. Use
  all the product columns (0-6) provided in the dataset to show this relationship.
  Ignore missing values and focus on helping me understand which product pairs are
  frequently bought together. Use clear labels for products on both axes of the heatmap
  for easy interpretation. Include a color legend to indicate the frequency of purchases.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Is there a specific color palette you would like for indicating different frequencies?

  3. What range of values should the color gradient cover for indicating frequency?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font size or style for the labels?

  5. Would you like any gridlines to be visible on the heatmap?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the products to be ordered on the axes
  (e.g., alphabetically, by frequency)?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to be displayed with or without borders around the
  cells?

  8. Should we include numerical values within the cells to indicate the exact frequency,
  in addition to the color legend?'
