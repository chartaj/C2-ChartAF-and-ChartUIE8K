initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Medical Insurance Cost Prediction data using
  a scatter plot. On the X-axis, plot the 'age' of individuals, and on the Y-axis,
  plot the 'charges' they incur. Differentiate the points based on the 'smoker' status
  by using different colors or markers. This will help me understand the relationship
  between age and medical charges and how smoking might influence these charges. Make
  sure to label the axes clearly and include a legend to indicate smoker status. Add
  a title, "Medical Insurance Costs by Age and Smoking Status".
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating smoker
  status?

  2. Would you like the markers to be shapes, filled circles, or any other specific
  type?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axes labels and
  title?

  4. Should grid lines be included on the scatter plot? If so, do you have a preference
  for their style or color?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers in the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to include data point labels or tooltips for additional information
  when viewing the chart?

  7. Is there a specific format or styling you prefer for the legend?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for the title and legend?

  9. Are there any specific axis scales (linear or logarithmic) you would like to
  use for age and charges?'
