initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the medical insurance
  costs based on different regions. Use 'region' as the categorical axis with bars
  representing the average insurance charges. Stack the bars by 'smoker' status (yes
  and no) to show how smoking affects insurance costs. Different colors should distinguish
  smokers from non-smokers within each region. Ensure the chart includes proper labels,
  a legend, and appropriate axis titles. The data should come from the given dataset
  on medical insurance costs, focusing on the influence of smoking status across different
  regions.
