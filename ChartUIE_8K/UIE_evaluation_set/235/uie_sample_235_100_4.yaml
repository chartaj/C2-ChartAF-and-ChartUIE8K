initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'charges' across
  different 'regions' to understand how medical costs vary by region. Use data from
  the provided dataset, and include 'smoker' categories to see the effect of smoking
  on charges in each region. Ensure the box chart shows minimum, first quartile, median,
  third quartile, and maximum values for each region. This will help in identifying
  any regional disparities in insurance costs, as well as how smoking status influences
  these costs. Highlight any outliers that could indicate extreme cases or anomalies
  in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between smoker categories?

  3. Do you have a preference for the ordering of ''regions'' on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by median ''charges'', etc.)?

  4. Would you prefer the outliers to be labeled or just marked with a symbol?

  5. Do you have a preference for the width of the boxes?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison across regions?

  7. Would you like any additional statistical information to be displayed on the
  chart (e.g., mean ''charges'')?'
