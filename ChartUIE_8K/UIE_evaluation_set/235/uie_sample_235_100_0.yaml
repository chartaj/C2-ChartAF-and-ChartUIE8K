initial_prompt: Create a population pyramid chart using the medical insurance cost
  prediction dataset. The chart should show age distribution split by sex. Highlight
  the age groups with the highest insurance charges. Add annotations to these age
  groups to display the actual charges. The purpose is to visually analyze the relationship
  between age, sex, and insurance charges, focusing on significant cost differences.
  Use contrasting colors for male and female segments and ensure the visualization
  is clear and informative, emphasizing the key data insights for business analysis.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for male and female segments\
  \ in the population pyramid chart?\n2. Which age groups would you like to be annotated\
  \ with actual charges? \n3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations\
  \ displaying the actual charges?\n4. Would you like gridlines or any background\
  \ elements to be included or emphasized in the chart?\n5. Is there a particular\
  \ layout or orientation (horizontal or vertical) you prefer for the population pyramid\
  \ chart?\n6. Should the axes be labeled with specific terms or units, or do you\
  \ have a preference for their placement?\n7. Do you have a preferred method for\
  \ highlighting the age groups with the highest insurance charges (e.g., different\
  \ shades, borders)?"
