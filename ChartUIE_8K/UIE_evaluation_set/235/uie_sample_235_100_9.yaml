initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the impact of age, BMI, and smoking status on
  medical insurance charges. Can you create a bubble chart where the x-axis represents
  age, the y-axis represents BMI, and the size of the bubbles represents the insurance
  charges? Additionally, could you color-code the bubbles by smoking status (e.g.,
  'yes' for smoker and 'no' for non-smoker)? This will help in understanding the correlation
  between these factors and the cost. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret,
  highlighting any significant trends. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to represent the smoking
  status?

  2. Would you like any specific age or BMI ranges to be highlighted?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, vibrant)?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to be added to the
  chart?

  6. Would you like to see trend lines or regression lines to better illustrate the
  correlation?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis titles and labels?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color-coding and bubble size?

  9. Is there a particular format for the axis scales (e.g., logarithmic, linear)
  that you prefer?

  10. Would you like to include data points'' details in tooltips when hovering over
  the bubbles?'
