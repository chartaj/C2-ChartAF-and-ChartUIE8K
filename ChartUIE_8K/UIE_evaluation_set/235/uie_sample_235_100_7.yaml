initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the distribution of the `smoker` and `region`
  columns in my medical insurance dataset using pie charts. Specifically, I want one
  pie chart showing the proportion of smokers versus non-smokers and another pie chart
  depicting the distribution of individuals across the four regions (southwest, southeast,
  northwest, northeast). Ensure the pie charts are clearly labeled and include the
  percentage and count for each category. This will help me better understand the
  demographic makeup of the insured individuals. Additionally, make sure the charts
  are visually distinct and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie charts?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the labels?

  3. Would you like a legend to be included in the pie charts?

  4. Do you prefer the pie sections to be separated (exploded view) or together?

  5. Do you have a specific order in which you would like the categories to be displayed?

  6. Would you like to include additional annotations besides percentages and counts?

  7. Should the pie charts include a title and, if so, what should the titles be?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background and border style?'
