initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map that visualizes the average medical insurance
  charges across different regions. Highlight the regions with the highest and lowest
  average charges to emphasize the disparity. Annotate the map with average age, BMI,
  and smoker data for each region. This visualization aims to provide a clear overview
  of how insurance costs vary geographically and the potential impacts of demographic
  factors on these costs. Use contrasting colors to differentiate the regions effectively.
  The purpose is to assist in understanding regional differences, possibly aiding
  in policy-making or targeted health interventions.

  5. Is it important to include a legend explaining the colors and demographic data
  annotations?

  6. Should the map include any geographic markers (e.g., state or country borders)?

  a tooltip format?

  8. Are there any additional data points or demographics you''d like to visualize
  on the map?'
