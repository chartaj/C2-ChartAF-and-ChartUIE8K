initial_prompt: I want a histogram showcasing the distribution of the total energy
  (tot energy / Eh) over time (t). This should help me see how the energy levels vary
  throughout the dataset. Each bar should represent a unique time interval, and the
  height of each bar should reflect the frequency of total energy values in that interval.
  Please ensure the x-axis is labeled with time intervals and the y-axis with the
  count of energy levels within those intervals. Use distinct colors for clarity,
  and make the chart as clear and easy to interpret as possible. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette or color
  scheme to be used in the histogram?

  2. What size and aspect ratio would you like the histogram to be?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be included in the background of the chart?

  4. Are there any specific labels, annotations, or markers you would like to be included
  in the chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font type and size for the labels on the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  6. How many time intervals (bins) would you prefer for the x-axis?

  7. Should there be a legend included in the chart, even though itâ€™s a histogram?

  8. Do you want any specific values or points highlighted in the histogram?'
answers: "1. I don't have a specific preference for the color palette. \n2. I am not\
  \ sure about the size and aspect ratio. \n3. Yes, please include gridlines in the\

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the font type and size for the labels.\n\
  6. I would prefer around 10-15 time intervals (bins) for the x-axis.\n7. No, a legend\
  \ is not necessary.\n8. I do not know if I want any specific values or points highlighted."
