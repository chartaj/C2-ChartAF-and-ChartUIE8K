initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the relationships and trends between
  bonds (1-2 and 1-14) and total energy over time (t). Use text annotations to highlight
  key points, providing more context. Incorporate shapes, like trend lines or arrows,
  to emphasize notable patterns in energy fluctuations. The goal is to make it easier
  to identify how bond lengths correlate with changes in total energy. This visualization
  will help analyze molecular dynamics and energy behavior over time, facilitating
  deeper insights into the chemical process and energy stability.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for the
  heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer certain styles for text annotations (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Are there any specific shapes or symbols you prefer for indicating trend lines
  or notable patterns?

  4. Do you have preferences for the scale of the heatmap (linear, logarithmic)?

  5. Would you like specific time intervals highlighted or emphasized within the heatmap?

  6. Are there any particular ranges of the data (time, bond lengths, energy levels)
  you would like to focus on or zoom into?

  7. Do you prefer grid lines to be shown or hidden on the heatmap?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap (e.g., square,
  rectangular)?'
