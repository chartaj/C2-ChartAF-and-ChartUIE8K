  1-2' and 'bond 1-14' over time ('t'). Use the total energy ('tot energy / Eh') as
  color coding.
questions: '1. What dimensions (height and width) do you prefer for the chart?

  2. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for ''tot energy / Eh''?

  3. Would you like to include specific axis labels or titles for the chart?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or any specific styling for the background?

  5. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the boxplots (e.g., whisker length,
