initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing 't' on the x-axis and 'tot energy /
  Eh' on the y-axis. Add text annotations for key data points and trend lines to illustrate
  changes over time. Use different shapes to highlight significant sections.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the trend lines or data points?

  2. How would you like the key data points to be annotated (e.g., with specific values,
  labels, etc.)?

  3. Are there specific sections or ranges of the data that you consider significant
  and want to highlight with different shapes?

  4. What type of trend lines would you prefer (e.g., linear, polynomial, smooth curve)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the shape or symbol used for data points in each
  significant section?

  6. Would you like any specific axis labels or titles for the chart?

  7. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations?

  8. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like to highlight the sections where significant changes occur in
  the data.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Time (t)" and the y-axis as "Total Energy (tot
  energy / Eh)".

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
