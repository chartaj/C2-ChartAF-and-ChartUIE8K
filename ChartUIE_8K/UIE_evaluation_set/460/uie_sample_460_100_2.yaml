initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot with 't' on the x-axis and 'tot energy / Eh'
  on the y-axis. Ensure that each data point is annotated with its specific value
  to highlight variations in total energy. Use arrows to emphasize trends or significant
  changes in the energy values over time. Add a horizontal line representing the average
  energy level. The purpose of this chart is to analyze how the total energy changes
  over time and identify any significant fluctuations, which could be critical for
  understanding energy stability.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the data points or annotations?

  2. What specific style would you like for the arrows (e.g., color, thickness)?

  3. Is there a preferred style for the horizontal line representing the average energy
  level (e.g., dashed, solid, color)?

  4. How would you like the annotations of data points to be formatted (e.g., font
  size, color)?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If so, what should they look like (e.g.,
  color, type)?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for axis titles and labels?

  7. Would you like any specific symbols or markers for the data points?

  8. Do you have a preference for the range or scale of the x-axis and y-axis (e.g.,
  logarithmic scale, specific range limits)?

  9. Should there be any specific background color or shading on the chart?

  10. Would you like to include a legend or key in the chart? If yes, where should
  it be positioned?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. A dashed line would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be helpful, but I am not sure about the specifics.

  6. No specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No specific preference.

  10. Yes, a legend would be helpful, preferably positioned at the bottom right.'
