initial_prompt: I need a **step line chart** to visualize the data for Cardano's cryptocurrency
  prices and volume. Highlight key dates and data points for better clarity, specifically
  annotating significant highs and lows. The chart should show fluctuations in the
  Open, High, Low, and Close prices over time with Volume represented to indicate
  trading activity. Utilize colors and size to emphasize important trends. This visual
  aid helps us understand Cardano's market behavior and identify trends over the given
  period. Include textual annotations for notable events to provide context and enhance
  analytical insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme for the chart?

  2. Which specific dates or events would you like to highlight on the chart?

  3. How would you like the volume to be represented? As bars or another form?

  4. Do you have a preferred position for the textual annotations on the chart?

  5. Would you like to see grid lines or background shading to emphasize certain time
  periods or data points?

  6. Is there a particular font or size preference for the axes labels or annotations?

  7. Do you have any specifications for the size of the step line segments or the
  markers for significant highs and lows?

  8. Do you need a legend to differentiate between Open, High, Low, Close prices,
  and Volume?

  9. Would you like to see any trend lines or moving averages overlaid on the step
  line chart?

  10. Are there any particular patterns or time periods you want to focus on more
  closely?'
