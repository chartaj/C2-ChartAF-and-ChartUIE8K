initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart for Cardano cryptocurrency data visualizing
  Date on the x-axis and Close prices on the y-axis. Use the Volume to determine the
  size of the bubbles. Add text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest Close
  prices to draw attention to significant change points. Use different colors to highlight

  decisions.

  in the chart?
