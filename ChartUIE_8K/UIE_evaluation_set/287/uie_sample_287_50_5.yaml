initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between various health
  metrics related to Parkinson's Disease from the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for individual data points in the heatmap?

  3. Should we display a correlation coefficient scale/legend?

  4. Are there specific metrics you want to prioritize or highlight within the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any particular formatting preferences for the axes labels (e.g.,
  font size, rotation)?

  6. Would you like to apply any data normalization or standardization before generating
  the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or dimensions for the heatmap (e.g., square, rectangular)?

  8. Should we cluster the health metrics to show similar patterns within the heatmap?'
