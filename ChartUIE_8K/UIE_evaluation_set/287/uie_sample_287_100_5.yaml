initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualization for the Parkinson's Disease Dataset
  Analysis. It should display correlations between multiple health variables such
  as Age, Gender, Ethnicity, BMI, Smoking, AlcoholConsumption, PhysicalActivity, DietQuality,
  SleepQuality, and medical conditions (Hypertension, Diabetes, Depression). Include
  family history and brain injury data too. Highlight strong correlations that might
  indicate risk factors. This will help in understanding the interplay between lifestyle,
  demographics, and health risks associated with Parkinson's. The color gradient should
  clearly show the strength of correlations, making it easy to identify significant
  relationships. Labels and color bar are important.
questions: '1. What color gradient do you prefer for displaying the strength of correlations
  on the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting strong correlations?

  3. What style of labels do you prefer for the axes (font size, type, angle)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the inclusion of value annotations within the heatmap
  cells?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the variables to be displayed
  on the axes?

  6. Do you want to include any specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preference for the range of the color bar?

  8. Should the heatmap display only significant correlations or all correlations
  regardless of their strength?

  9. Do you want to include any specific grid lines or separators between the cells?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer a color scheme that uses strong colors like red and green to highlight
  strong correlations.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, inclusion of value annotations within the heatmap cells would be helpful.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include the title "Correlation Heatmap of Health Variables and Parkinson''s
  Disease Risk Factors".

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Please display all correlations regardless of their strength.

  9. I do not know.
