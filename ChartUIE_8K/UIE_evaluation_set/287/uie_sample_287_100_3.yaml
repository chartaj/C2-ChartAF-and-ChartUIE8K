initial_prompt: I'd like a grouped bar chart comparing the SleepQuality, DietQuality,
  and PhysicalActivity scores across the three patients in the Parkinson's Disease
  dataset. These health metrics are crucial for understanding lifestyle factors that
  may influence the disease. The x-axis should represent the PatientIDs (3058, 3059,
  3060), and the y-axis should indicate the scores. Each group of bars should have
  different colors for SleepQuality, DietQuality, and PhysicalActivity to distinguish
  them easily. Additionally, please include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing SleepQuality,
  DietQuality, and PhysicalActivity?

  2. Would you like the chart to have grid lines for easier value estimation?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include data labels displaying the exact score values on each
  bar?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the bars (SleepQuality, DietQuality, PhysicalActivity)
  to appear within each patient group?

  6. Would you like to include any particular title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific style preferences or themes for the overall appearance
  of the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed)?

  8. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?

  9. Should the y-axis have specific intervals or a particular range that you want
  to set?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  chart?'
