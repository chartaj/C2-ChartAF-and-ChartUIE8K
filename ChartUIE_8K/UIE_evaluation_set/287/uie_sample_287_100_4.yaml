initial_prompt: I need a histogram that visualizes the Age distribution of the patients
  in the Parkinson's Disease dataset. The x-axis should display age groups, and the
  y-axis should show the number of patients within each age group. This will help
  identify which age groups have the highest and lowest occurrences of patients diagnosed
  with Parkinson's Disease. Could you please create this chart for me? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. What age group intervals would you like to use on the x-axis (e.g., 0-10, 11-20)?

  3. Should the y-axis display the number of patients as a count or percentage?

  4. Would you like to include labels for the bars indicating the exact number of
  patients?

  5. Do you prefer any specific title for the histogram?

  6. Are there any specific data points or age groups you would like to highlight?

  7. Should the histogram include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Do you want a legend included in the chart, or is it unnecessary?

  9. Would you like the histogram to follow a particular style (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed)?'

  2. 10-year intervals (e.g., 0-10, 11-20).
