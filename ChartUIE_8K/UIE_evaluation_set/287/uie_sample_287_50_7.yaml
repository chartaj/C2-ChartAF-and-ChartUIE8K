initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the relationship between Age and UPDRS
  scores from the Parkinson's Dataset. Include data points and lines connecting these
  points. Highlight the trend by plotting average UPDRS scores across different age
  groups. Label axes clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the data points to be shown with specific markers?

  3. How would you like the average UPDRS scores across different age groups to be
  highlighted (e.g., different line style, color)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart to distinguish different
  elements?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, how prominent should they be?

  7. Is there a specific range for the y-axis (UPDRS scores) that should be displayed?

  8. Would you like to include error bars or any other indicators of variability for
  the average scores?

  9. Do you have a preference for the intervals or grouping of age on the x-axis?

  10. Should specific data points or trends be annotated with text for emphasis?'
