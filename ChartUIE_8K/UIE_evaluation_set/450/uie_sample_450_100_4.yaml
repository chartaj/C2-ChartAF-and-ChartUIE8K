initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique fruit names
  found in the 'blueberry' and 'blueberry.1' columns from the provided data. Each
  slice should represent a different fruit from both columns. Since both data sets
  are related to fruit color within the food-and-drink category, this will help us
  easily identify the proportion of each fruit type present in the data. Ensure that
  the chart is clearly labeled and easy to read, highlighting any similarities or
  differences between the two columns. Include a legend to differentiate between the
  two columns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the slices of the pie
  chart?

  2. Do you prefer the chart to display percentages or actual counts?

  3. How would you like the data to be labeled on the slices (e.g., just the fruit
  name, fruit name and count, fruit name and percentage)?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., right side,
  bottom, etc.)?

  6. Would you like to include any additional titles or subtitles in the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall design or theme of the pie
  chart (e.g., minimalist, colorful, professional)?'
