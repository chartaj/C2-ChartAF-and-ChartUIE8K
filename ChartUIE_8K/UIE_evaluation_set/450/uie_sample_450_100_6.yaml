initial_prompt: I have a dataset about fruit colors in food-and-drink category with
  two columns, one named "blueberry" and the other "blueberry.1." Both columns have
  5 unique values without any missing data. Please create a column chart that shows
  the frequency of each unique value across both columns. The x-axis should represent
  each unique fruit listed (apple, blueberry, and lime), and the y-axis should represent
  their frequency count. Use different colors for each column in the chart to differentiate
  between "blueberry" and "blueberry.1." This will help visualize the distribution
  of fruit colors effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns "blueberry"
  and "blueberry.1"?

  2. Would you prefer a specific order for the fruit categories on the x-axis?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  titles?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the chart title or axis titles?

  6. Would you like to display the exact frequency counts on top of the columns?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t have a specific order preference for the fruits on the x-axis.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  5. I have no specific preference for the chart title or axis titles.

  6. Yes, I would like to display the exact frequency counts on top of the columns.'
