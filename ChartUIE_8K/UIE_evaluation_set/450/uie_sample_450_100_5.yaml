initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of various fruits.
  The dataset includes columns for 'blueberry' and 'blueberry.1' with values such
  as 'apple', 'blueberry', and 'lime'. Each fruit type should be represented by its
  own segment in the donut chart. The data does not contain any missing values and
  is of categorical type. Ensure each unique fruit type from both columns is clearly
  labeled and visually distinguishable within the chart. This will help in understanding
  the prevalence of each fruit type in the dataset. The details pertain to fruit color
  in the food-and-drink category.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different fruit types?

  2. Would you like the chart to display the exact percentage or value for each segment?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, or do you want the labels directly on the
  segments?

  5. Is there a specific title or caption you would like to appear on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall size or dimensions of the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes within the chart?

  8. Are there any specific styling preferences for the donut chart''s central hole
  (e.g., size or color)?'
