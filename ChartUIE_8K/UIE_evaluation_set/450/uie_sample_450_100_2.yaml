initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the frequency of different fruits using
  the blueberry and blueberry.1 columns. Highlight the bars for 'blueberry' to emphasize
  them with a brighter color. Add a rectangle to enclose the 'lime' bars in both columns
  for comparison purposes. This visualization helps compare the occurrences of each
  fruit, emphasizing the 'blueberry' fruit's frequency, and draws attention to 'lime'
  across both columns using colored highlights and shapes. This will help us understand
  the distribution and emphasize the importance of certain fruits in our dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. What specific color do you want for highlighting ''blueberry'' bars?

  3. Should the rectangle enclosing ''lime'' bars have a specific color or style?

  4. Do you have a preferred font for labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the highlights and rectangling?

  6. Should there be any specific labeling format for the axis?

  7. Do you want the chart to include data labels showing the exact frequency on each
  bar?'
