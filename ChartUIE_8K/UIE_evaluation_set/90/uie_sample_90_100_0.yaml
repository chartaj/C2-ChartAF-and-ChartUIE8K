initial_prompt: Visualize global access to electricity from 2000-2020 using a column
  chart that shows the percentage of the population with access in different countries
  over the years. Highlight countries with the highest and lowest access rates. Add
  text annotations to display the exact percentage values for selected data points
  to emphasize trends. This will help us understand progress and identify areas needing
  improvement. Include the energy intensity level of primary energy as a secondary
  metric, using color coding to differentiate between varying levels. This context
  aids in evaluating energy consumption efficiency globally.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. Should the countries with the highest and lowest access rates be highlighted
  using specific colors or styles?

  3. Are there specific countries or regions that you want to emphasize more than
  others?

  4. What time intervals would you like to use on the x-axis (e.g., yearly, every
  5 years)?

  5. Do you have a preferred format or style for the text annotations displaying percentage
  values?

  6. Should the secondary metric (energy intensity level of primary energy) be displayed
  using a gradient or distinct color categories?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or key for the color coding of energy intensity
  levels?

  8. Are there any specific trends or patterns you want to highlight in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use specific colors to highlight countries with the highest and lowest
  access rates.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Every 5 years sounds good to me.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please use distinct color categories for the energy intensity levels.

  7. Yes, please include a legend for the color coding of energy intensity levels.

  8. I am not sure.'
