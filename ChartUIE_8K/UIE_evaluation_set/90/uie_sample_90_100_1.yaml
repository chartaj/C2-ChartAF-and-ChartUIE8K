initial_prompt: I would like a histogram visualizing the access to electricity (%
  of population) over the years from 2000 to 2020. Highlight the years with significant
  changes, and annotate those points with the exact percentages. The purpose is to
  track progress in sustainable energy access globally. Make sure to differentiate
  between different countries clearly, perhaps by color-coding them. Also, include
  annotations for the highest financial flows to developing countries, and any notable
  peaks or dips in renewable energy share. The goal is to understand energy consumption
  patterns and financial trends in developing regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used for
  differentiating countries?

  2. Do you prefer a specific type of annotation format or style for highlighting
  significant changes and financial flows?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or text sizes you would like for the annotations
  and axis labels?

  4. How would you like the X-axis and Y-axis to be labeled and formatted?

  5. Would you like a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the bin width or number of bins for the histogram?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you have any specific preferences
  for their appearance?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the countries to be displayed in, or
  should they be sorted alphabetically?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. The X-axis should be labeled as "Year" and the Y-axis as "Access to Electricity
  (% of Population)".

  5. Yes, I would like a legend positioned at the bottom right of the chart.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, include gridlines. I have no specific preference for their appearance.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
