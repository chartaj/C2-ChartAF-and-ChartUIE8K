  2. Would you prefer any specific year intervals (e.g., every year, every 5 years)
  to be emphasized on the x-axis?

  3. Is there a particular order you would like the data segments (renewable energy
  share, electricity from fossil fuels, electricity from renewables) to appear in
  each bar?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title and labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any annotations or data labels you would like to include directly on
  the chart?
