initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the access to electricity,
  clean fuels for cooking, and renewable energy share across different years for each
  country in the dataset. The x-axis should display the countries and years, while
  the y-axis should represent the percentages. Use different colors to denote electricity
  access, clean cooking fuels, and renewable energy share. This will help to compare
  the progress made in sustainable energy access from 2000 to 2020.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to distinguish
  between electricity access, clean cooking fuels, and renewable energy share?

  2. How would you like the countries and years to be arranged on the x-axis? For
  example, should countries be grouped together with years within each group, or should
  years be grouped together with countries within each group?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the label formats on the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart? If so, do you have any
  preferences for their appearance?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences or styles for the axis labels, titles,
  and legends?

  6. Is there any particular way you would like us to handle missing data in the dataset
  when creating the stacked bar chart?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or highlights on the chart to emphasize
  certain data points or trends?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or size of the chart? For example,
  should it be optimized for presentation slides or a printed report?'
