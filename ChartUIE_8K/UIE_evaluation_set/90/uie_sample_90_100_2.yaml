initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot visualizing the Global Data on Sustainable Energy
  from 2000-2020. The main focus should be on the access to electricity (% of population)
  over the years, highlighting specific data points for Renewable energy share in
  the total final energy consumption (%) and Financial flows to developing countries
  (US $). Text annotations should indicate the values of these highlighted points
  to draw attention. Make sure to use different colors to distinguish between various
  years and countries. The goal is to understand the trends and disparities in sustainable
  energy access across different regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  years and countries in the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the axis labels and title to be in a particular font or style?

  3. Is there a specific range for the axes that you would like to set?

  4. Do you prefer a certain size or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  5. How many significant figures or decimal places should the text annotations display
  for the highlighted points?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart?

  7. Do you require any grid lines on the scatter plot, and if so, should they be
  styled in a specific way?

  8. Are there any additional data points or trends you want to be highlighted apart
  from the specified attributes?

  9. Do you want the scatter plot to include any reference lines (e.g., average lines)
  for better context?

  10. Would you prefer a dark or light theme for the scatter plot background?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, I have no specific preference.

  3. I do not know, I have no specific range in mind.

  4. I am not sure, I have no specific preference.

  5. Two decimal places would be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference for the legend position.

  7. I do not know, I have no specific preference.

  8. No, just the specified attributes are fine.

  9. I am not sure, I do not have a preference for reference lines.

  10. I prefer a light theme for the scatter plot background.'
