initial_prompt: I have a dataset about world languages, including language, family,
  region, speakers, writing system, and ISO code. I want to visualize the global distribution
  and prevalence of these languages. Please create a geographic heatmap that highlights
  the regions where these languages are spoken the most. The heatmap should use the
  "Speakers" data to show intensity, with more speakers resulting in a higher intensity
  color. Ensure that each region is clearly labeled, and the map indicates the family
  to which each language belongs. Missing ISO code values should be left blank. Thanks!
questions: '1. Are there any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap to represent different intensities?

  2. Do you have a preferred map projection or style (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  3. Should the map include country borders, labels, or any geographical landmarks
  for context?

  4. Would you like a legend or color scale to be included to indicate the intensity
  levels of speakers?

  5. Is there a preferred font or label style for the region names and language family
  annotations?

  6. Should the visualization highlight any specific languages or families, or should
  all data points be treated equally?

  7. Are there any specific regions or languages you want to emphasize or deemphasize
  in the visualization?

  8. Would you prefer a particular size or aspect ratio for the heatmap to accommodate
  specific display or publication needs?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include country borders and labels for context.

  4. Yes, a legend or color scale to indicate the intensity levels of speakers would
  be helpful.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. All data points should be treated equally.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
