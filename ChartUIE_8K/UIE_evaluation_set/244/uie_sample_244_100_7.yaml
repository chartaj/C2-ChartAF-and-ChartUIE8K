initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the number of speakers for each
  language listed in the dataset. Display the languages on the x-axis and the number
  of speakers on the y-axis. Ensure that the chart captures all entries, and color-code
  the bars for better clarity. Annotations for the highest and lowest speaker counts
  would be helpful. Additionally, include a legend to distinguish between different
  language families. The histogram should provide an insightful overview of language
  prevalence by speaker count in the specified regions.
