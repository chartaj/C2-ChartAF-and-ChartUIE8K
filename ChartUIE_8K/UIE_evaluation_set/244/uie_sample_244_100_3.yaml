initial_prompt: I'm working on a project related to world languages and want to visualize
  the distribution of languages, their families, and regions using a Treemap. Please
  use the 'World Languages Dataset' to create a Treemap chart where each language
  is represented as a tile. The size of each tile should be proportional to the number
  of speakers. Additionally, group the languages by their respective families and
  regions. Highlight the different writing systems and make sure to label each tile
  with its language and family. Use colors to distinguish between different regions.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  regions?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the labels on each
  tile?

  3. Do you prefer any specific legend placement or design for the chart?

  4. Would you like to see any specific ordering within the groups (e.g., alphabetical,
  by number of speakers)?

  5. Do you have a preference for how the highlighting of different writing systems
  should be represented (e.g., color, pattern, border)?

  6. Are there any specific size constraints or dimensions for the Treemap chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Please order the languages by the number of speakers within each group.

  5. Use different border styles to highlight the different writing systems.

  6. I do not have specific size constraints.'
