initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart visualizing the number of speakers for
  languages grouped by their family. Ensure each column represents a language family,
  and the stacks within each column differentiate the languages. Highlight those with
  notable writing systems. The chart will help linguistics enthusiasts and researchers
  quickly grasp the distribution of language speakers among various families and regions.
  Use bright colors to distinguish the different languages within each family. The
  x-axis should list the language families, and the y-axis should represent the number
  of speakers. Please include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bright colors used to
  distinguish different languages within each family?

  2. Should any specific colors be used to highlight notable writing systems?

  3. Would you like to include data labels (numbers of speakers) directly on the stacks
  in the columns?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the format or style of the legend?

  5. Is there a specific order in which the language families should appear on the
  x-axis?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines or reference lines on the y-axis for better
  readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer if notable writing systems are highlighted with shades of blue.

  3. Yes, I would like to include data labels directly on the stacks in the columns.

  4. I do not have any specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, the chart should include grid lines or reference lines on the y-axis for
  better readability.'
