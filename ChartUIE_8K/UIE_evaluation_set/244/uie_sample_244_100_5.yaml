initial_prompt: Can you create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of language
  families across different regions based on the 'World Languages Dataset'? Specifically,
  represent different language families on one axis and the regions on the other,
  with the intensity of the heatmap indicating the number of speakers in millions.
  Make sure to handle the missing ISO codes appropriately and use a color gradient
  that clearly distinguishes low and high values. This visualization will help identify
  which regions have the highest concentration of languages within specific families.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like gridlines or separators between the different families and regions?

  3. How would you like the missing ISO codes to be represented or handled in the
  heatmap?

  4. Do you have any preference for the labels'' font size and style on the axes?

  5. Would you prefer a specific range or scale for the color intensity to represent
  the number of speakers?

  6. Do you need a legend to explain the color gradient?

  7. Should the values of the number of speakers be displayed on the heatmap cells?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the heatmap?

  9. Is there any specific order in which you would like the language families or
  regions to be arranged?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  7. Yes, displaying the values would be useful.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have any specific order in mind.'
