initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize the water quality data.
  Specifically, I want to compare the various water quality parameters (ph, Hardness,
  Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity)
  for potable and non-potable water samples. Each parameter should be represented
  as a different color in the stacked columns. The x-axis should show Potability (0
  and 1), and the y-axis should show the values of the parameters. Please make sure
  to indicate missing values where applicable. This chart should help visualize differences
  in water quality parameters between potable and non-potable water.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for each water quality
  parameter in the stacked columns?

  2. How would you like missing values to be indicated on the chart (e.g., using a
  specific color or pattern)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels on the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing each parameter?

  5. Is there a preferred order in which the water quality parameters should be stacked
  in the columns?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, do you have any preferences
  for their style or color?

  7. Should the chart include data labels indicating the exact values of the parameters
  within the stacked columns?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for chart title and axes titles?

  9. Would you like to apply any specific scaling or normalization to the values on
  the y-axis?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure about specific colors.

  2. I am not sure how to indicate missing values.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  4. Yes, I would like to include a legend.

  5. I do not have a preferred order for the parameters.

  6. Grid lines would be nice. I am not sure about the style or color.

  7. Yes, please include data labels.

  8. Chart title could be "Water Quality Comparison". X-axis title: "Potability",
  Y-axis title: "Parameter Values".

  9. No specific scaling or normalization is needed.
