initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize water quality over time. The
  x-axis should represent different measurements or samples, while the y-axis should
  represent the values of 'ph', 'Hardness', 'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate', 'Conductivity',
  'Organic_carbon', 'Trihalomethanes', and 'Turbidity'. Each water quality parameter
  should be represented by a separate colored line to clearly differentiate the trends
  in their values. This will help in understanding the changes in water quality parameters
  and their potential impact on potability. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing each
  water quality parameter?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend for identifying each water quality
  parameter?

  3. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you want data points to be marked on the lines to show individual measurements
  or samples?

  5. How would you like missing data to be handled in the line chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style for the chart (e.g., dashed lines, solid lines)?

  7. Should the y-axis be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  8. Would you like labels on the x-axis to specify the time or sample identification?

  9. Do you want to include a title and axis labels for the chart? If so, do you have
  specific text in mind?

  10. Should the chart include any annotations or markers for significant events or
  thresholds?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, please include a legend for identifying each water quality parameter.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please mark data points on the lines to show individual measurements or
  samples.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Linear scale, please.

  8. Yes, please include labels on the x-axis to specify the time or sample identification.

  9. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. Title: "Water Quality Parameters
  Over Time," X-axis label: "Measurements/Samples," Y-axis label: "Parameter Values."

  10. I am not sure.'
