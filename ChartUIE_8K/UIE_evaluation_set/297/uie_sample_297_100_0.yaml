initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the potability of water samples
  based on the given data columns. Use the 'Potability' column to highlight areas
  where water is potable (colored green) and non-potable (colored red). Include annotations
  to display average values of 'ph', 'Hardness', 'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate',
  'Conductivity', 'Organic_carbon', 'Trihalomethanes', and 'Turbidity' for selected
  regions. This will help in understanding regional water quality variations and focus
  on areas needing attention for improving water safety. The chart should emphasize
  regions with missing data to identify data collection gaps.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred geographic regions to emphasize in the heatmap?

  2. What specific color palettes or shades would you prefer for the green and red
  color coding?

  3. Do you have any preferred locations for annotations on the chart?

  4. Would you like a specific format for the annotations displaying average values?

  5. Are there any additional stylistic elements (such as borders, font styles, or
  sizes) you would like included in the chart?

  6. How would you like the regions with missing data to be visually highlighted?

  7. Do you want any particular basemap style or mapping service (e.g., Google Maps,
  OpenStreetMap)?

  8. Should there be any specific labeling for the geographic areas or regions on
  the map?

  9. Are there any specific legends or titles you would like to include in the heatmap?'
answers: '<emulated amateur user response>


  1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer using a medium green for potable and a medium red for non-potable areas.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, I''ll leave that up to you.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Highlight regions with missing data using a gray shade.

  7. I do not know, whichever is best.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include a legend to distinguish between potable, non-potable, and
  regions with missing data, and a title that reflects the water quality heatmap.
