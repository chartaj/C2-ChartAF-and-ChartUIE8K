initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the average values of 'ph', 'Hardness',
  'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate', 'Conductivity', 'Organic_carbon', 'Trihalomethanes',
  and 'Turbidity' for potable and non-potable water. Highlight the highest average
  value in each category. Include text annotations to display these average values
  on the bars.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars for potable and non-potable water to be placed side by
  side or stacked?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations displaying
  the average values?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the highlights indicating the highest average
  value (e.g., different bar color, pattern, or outline)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between potable and non-potable
  water, or is labeling each bar sufficient?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for easier comparison of bar heights?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or axis limits?

  9. Would you like to include error bars or confidence intervals for the average
  values?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or formatting preferred for the axis labels and
  titles?

  11. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars, vertical or horizontal?'
