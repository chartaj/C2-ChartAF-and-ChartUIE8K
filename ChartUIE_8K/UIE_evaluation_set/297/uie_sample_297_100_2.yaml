initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart for visualizing the distribution of the
  water quality parameters from the dataset. Focus on key columns: ''ph'', ''Hardness'',
  ''Solids'', ''Chloramines'', ''Sulfate'', ''Conductivity'', ''Organic_carbon'',
  ''Trihalomethanes'', and ''Turbidity''. Highlight significant outliers in each parameter
  to indicate potential water quality issues. Add text annotations to specify the
  median values of each parameter and draw attention to the ''Potability'' results,
  distinguishing between potable and non-potable water samples. This visualization
  will help in understanding water quality and potability.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between potable
  and non-potable water samples?

  2. Would you like the text annotations for the median values to be placed inside
  or outside the box of the box plot?

  3. Is there a specific style or format you prefer for highlighting significant outliers
  (e.g., different colors, shapes, or sizes)?

  4. Do you have a particular font preference for the text annotations?

  5. Should gridlines be included in the chart for better readability, and if so,
  do you have a preference for their style (solid, dashed)?

  6. Would you like the y-axis to be on a logarithmic scale due to the broad range
  of values across different parameters?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like for the axes and overall
  chart?

  8. Is there a particular layout you prefer for the legend, especially in distinguishing
  between potable and non-potable water samples?

  9. Do you want each parameter to be plotted on the same chart or on separate charts
  for each parameter?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Inside the box of the box plot.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines. I have no specific preference for their style.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific labels or titles, just something clear and informative.

  8. I do not know.

  9. All parameters on the same chart would be preferable.'
