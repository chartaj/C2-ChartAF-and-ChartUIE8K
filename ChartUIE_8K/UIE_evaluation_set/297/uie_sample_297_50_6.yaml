initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize water quality trends. Use 'ph', 'Hardness',
  'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate', 'Conductivity', 'Organic_carbon', 'Trihalomethanes',
  and 'Turbidity' as the y-axes. The x-axis should represent the observation index.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used in the line chart?

  2. Should the lines have different styles (dashed, dotted, solid) for better distinction
  among attributes?

  3. Do you prefer a legend to be displayed, and if so, where would you like it positioned
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to include on the
  chart (e.g., specific observation points, thresholds)?

  5. How would you like the missing values to be handled in the visualization?

  6. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the lines representing each attribute?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be present on the chart, and if so, do you prefer
  them to be full or dashed?

  8. Should the y-axes be positioned differently, such as some on the left and some
  on the right, to accommodate multiple attributes?

  9. How should the x-axis be labeled, considering it represents the observation index?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for axis labels and
  the title of the chart?'
