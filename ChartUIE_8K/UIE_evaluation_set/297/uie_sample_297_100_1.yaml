initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart to compare the average values of various water
  quality indicators (ph, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon,
  Trihalomethanes, Turbidity) for potable (Potability=1) and non-potable (Potability=0)
  water samples. Highlight bars that have significantly different averages between
  potable and non-potable samples. Annotate important data points that indicate significant
  differences or interesting insights. This will help in understanding which parameters
  are most critical for determining water potability. Title the chart "Comparison
  of Water Quality Indicators: Potable vs. Non-Potable".'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  potable and non-potable water?

  2. How would you like significant differences between averages to be highlighted?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the annotations indicating important
  data points or interesting insights?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart title and labels?

  6. Would you like a legend included in the chart? If yes, where would you like it
  to be placed?

  7. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order (e.g., by the significance of
  difference, alphabetically)?

  8. Do you have any preferred dimensions or aspect ratio for the chart?

  9. Would you like to include reference lines or markers to indicate thresholds or
  benchmarks for certain water quality indicators?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the axis ranges or scaling method (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?'
