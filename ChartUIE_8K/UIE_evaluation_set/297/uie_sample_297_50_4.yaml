initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between water hardness
  and turbidity, colored by potability. Use 'Hardness' for the x-axis, 'Turbidity'
  for the y-axis, and 'Potability' for the color coding of the points.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for coding the ''Potability''
  attribute?

  2. What should be the title of the scatter plot?

  3. Do you prefer specific axis labels or should they be automatically derived from
  the attribute names?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic or linear) you prefer for the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Should the plot include a legend indicating the color coding for ''Potability''?
  If yes, do you have a preference for its position?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size or opacity of the scatter plot points?

  9. Should the chart include any annotations or reference lines? If so, please specify.

  10. Are there any specific thresholds or boundary values that should be highlighted
  in the scatter plot for ''Hardness'' or ''Turbidity''?'
