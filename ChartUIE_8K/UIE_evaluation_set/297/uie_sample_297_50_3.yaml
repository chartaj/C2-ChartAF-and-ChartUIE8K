initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between water quality parameters
  (ph, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes,
  Turbidity) and potability. Highlight highly correlated parameters to identify key
  water quality indicators.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preferred method for highlighting highly correlated parameters
  (e.g., specific colors or annotations)?

  3. Would you like to set specific ranges for the correlation values to be highlighted?

  4. Do you want the heatmap to display the correlation values numerically on each
  cell?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the axes labels (e.g., font size, font style)?

  6. What level of detail do you prefer for the legend (e.g., number of intervals,
  descriptive labels)?

  7. Do you want to include any specific titles or captions for the heatmap?

  8. Is there any specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for better visualization?

  9. Do you prefer grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  10. Would you like to include a brief summary or description of the key findings
  directly on the heatmap?'
