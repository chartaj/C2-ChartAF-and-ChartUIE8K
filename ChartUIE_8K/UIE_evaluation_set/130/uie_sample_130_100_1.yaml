initial_prompt: '<start of user instructions>

  I would like a donut chart visualizing the distribution of dishes by state from
  the Indian Food 101 dataset. This chart will help highlight regional culinary diversity.
  Make sure to annotate the chart with values and include highlights for the states
  with the most and least number of dishes. The purpose here is to showcase the variety
  of Indian food by region, making it clear which states contribute most and least
  to the cuisine. Use different colors to distinguish the states effectively.

  <end of user instructions>'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing the states?

  2. How would you like the values to be annotated on the chart (inside the donut
  slices, outside, or both)?

  3. Do you want specific labels or legends for the states with the most and least
  number of dishes?

  4. Should the size of the donut hole be adjusted, or do you have any preference
  for its size?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the states to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by number of dishes)?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styling preferences for the text annotations
  and highlights?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title or subtitle? If so, do you have any
  specific wording in mind?

  8. Do you prefer any specific data aggregation method for states with a similar
  number of dishes?

  9. Should the chart include tooltips or additional information when hovering over
  the states?'
