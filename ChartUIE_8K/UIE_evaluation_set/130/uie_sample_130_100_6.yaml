initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of Indian
  desserts by region. The data should come from the given dataset of Indian foods,
  which includes columns such as name, ingredients, diet, prep time, cook time, flavor
  profile, course, state, and region. Specifically, I want to see how many desserts
  come from each region (East, West, North, etc.). The chart should help me understand
  the regional diversity of Indian desserts at a glance.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the pie chart?

  5. Do you want the dessert names to be included in the chart labels?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text elements of the
  chart?
