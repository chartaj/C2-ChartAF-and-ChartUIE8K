initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the proportion of different courses
  (dessert, main course, etc.) from the Indian Food 101 dataset. Use text annotations
  to highlight unique flavor profiles and highlight the regions where certain foods
  are popular. This will help in understanding regional flavor preferences.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind to represent the different courses
  in the donut chart?

  2. Should we use specific shades or color schemes to differentiate between regions?

  3. Do you want the chart to have a particular title or subtitle?

  4. What level of detail would you like for the text annotations?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations and labels?

  6. Would you prefer any specific placement for the text annotations (e.g., inside
  the chart segments, outside, or with leader lines)?

  7. Should the proportions of the courses be displayed as percentages, raw numbers,
  or both?

  8. Do you have any preference for the legend placement (e.g., top, bottom, side)?

  9. Would you like grid lines or separators between sectors in the donut chart?

  10. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size requirement for the chart?

  11. Should the regions be represented using a particular marker or icon within the
  text annotations?'
