initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'prep_time' for
  different dishes in the Indian Food 101 dataset. The x-axis should represent the
  'prep_time' in minutes, divided into uniform bins, while the y-axis should denote
  the frequency of dishes prepared within each time range. Ensure the chart highlights
  preparation time variability across various Indian recipes, making it easy to see
  which prep times are most common. The histogram should provide clear insights into
  how long it typically takes to prepare different Indian foods, offering valuable
  information for meal planning.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram?

  2. How many bins would you like to use for the ''prep_time'' axis?

  3. Would you like the edges of the bins to be clearly marked?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be for both axes or just
  the x-axis?

  5. Should the histogram include a title? If yes, what should it be?

  6. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  7. Do you want any annotations or labels on the bars indicating the frequency values?

  8. Should the x-axis have a specific range, or should it include all possible ''prep_time''
  values?

  9. Do you prefer the y-axis to start at zero, or should it adjust based on the data
  range?

  10. Would you like any specific styling or formatting for the axis labels (e.g.,
  bold, italic)?'
