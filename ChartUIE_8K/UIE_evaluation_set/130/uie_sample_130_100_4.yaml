initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the preparation and cooking
  time of different Indian desserts. The data file (130.csv) includes details such
  as name, ingredients, diet, prep time, cook time, flavor profile, course, state,
  and region. Ensure the box plot shows the distribution of these times for a clear
  comparison. Include labels for each box representing different desserts. Use different
  colors to distinguish between prep and cook times. Add titles and labels for clarity.
  This visualization will help see the variation and central tendencies in cooking
  and preparation times for different desserts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the box plot?

  2. Would you like any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  and cooking time?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed in the background?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the labels (horizontal or vertical)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between preparation time and
  cooking time?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., fixed
  range, auto-scaling)?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or data points on the box plot?

  9. Do you want to display any statistical details (e.g., mean, median) on the box
  plot?

  10. Is there any specific information you would like in the tooltips when hovering
  over the data points?'
