initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization for the Indian Food 101 dataset. Use
  the 'state' column to categorize the dishes and the 'prep_time' and 'cook_time'
  columns to denote the size of each square in the Treemap. Each food item should
  be a leaf node within its state category. Color-code the leaves based on the 'flavor_profile'
  column, differentiating between 'sweet' and other flavors. Make sure each state's
  section is easily distinguishable, allowing for quick comparison of preparation
  times across different dishes and states. This will help visualize regional cooking
  times for Indian cuisine.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating ''sweet''
  and other flavors?

  2. How would you prefer the states to be distinguished visually within the Treemap?

  3. Is there a specific way you want the preparation and cooking times to be proportioned
  in the Treemap?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout and distribution of the leaf nodes
  within state categories?

  5. Should any specific states or dishes be highlighted or given more prominence
  in the chart?

  6. Do you have font or styling preferences for any text labels within the Treemap?

  7. Would you like to include any specific legends or annotations to help interpret
  the Treemap?'
