  column for the x-axis and the 'Volume' column for the y-axis.

  2. Would you prefer the dates on the x-axis to be displayed in a particular format
  (e.g., ''YYYY-MM-DD'', ''MM/DD/YYYY'')?

  3. Do you want gridlines in the chart? If so, should they be displayed on both axes
  or only on one axis?

  and ''Volume''?

  5. Would you like to add any annotations or markers to highlight particular dates
  or volumes?

  6. Do you want the chart to include a legend, or is it unnecessary due to the simplicity
  of the visualization?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s overall theme or style (e.g., minimalist,
  professional, colorful)?

  9. Is there a specific range for the y-axis you would like to set, or should it
  be automatically adjusted based on the data?
