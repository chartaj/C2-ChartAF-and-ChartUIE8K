initial_prompt: Create a box chart of ARM stock data by Date (x-axis) showing the
  distribution of High, Low, and Close prices (y-axis) from the data file "../Extra_datas/data/13.csv".
  The chart should help visualize the price range variations over time. Include all-time
  data points to ensure trends and outliers are noticeable for business analysis.
  Make sure to use different colors for High, Low, and Close prices to clearly distinguish
  each category on the chart. Include volume as a secondary plot if feasible. Title
  the chart appropriately and include axis labels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the High, Low, and Close prices
  categories?

  2. How would you like the volume data to be represented as a secondary plot (e.g.,
  bar chart, line chart)?

  3. Do you have a specific format or style preference for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  4. Would you like to include any additional labels or annotations on the chart to
  highlight particular trends or outliers?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges or periods that you would like to focus on
  or emphasize in the chart?'
