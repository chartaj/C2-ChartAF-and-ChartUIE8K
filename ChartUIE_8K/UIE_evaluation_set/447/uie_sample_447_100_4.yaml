initial_prompt: Please create a Marimekko chart to visualize the provided data on
  business salaries for women and men. The x-axis should represent the categories
  "Women's millions of dollars" and "Men's millions of dollars." The width of each
  category section should be proportional to the number of unique values it contains.
  The y-axis should represent the salary figures in millions of dollars. Ensure that
  the chart highlights the differences in salary distribution between women and men
  in a business context, making it easy to compare their financial earnings visually.
