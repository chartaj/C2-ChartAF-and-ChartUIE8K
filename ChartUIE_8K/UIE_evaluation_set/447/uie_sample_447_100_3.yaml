initial_prompt: I have data about salaries for women and men in millions of dollars
  covering various business sectors. Each gender's earnings are recorded in separate
  columns with no missing values. Iâ€™d like a grouped bar chart comparing women's and
  men's salaries across these sectors. Each group on the x-axis should represent a
  different sector (Women and Men), and the y-axis will show salary amounts in millions
  of dollars. The goal is to visually compare the earnings gap between genders in
  each business sector, highlighting any discrepancy in salaries. Please ensure the
  chart is clear and labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme to represent women''s
  and men''s salaries?

  2. Would you like to include data labels for each bar showing the exact salary amounts?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order of the business sectors on the x-axis?

  4. Should there be a title for the chart? If so, please specify the title.

  5. Would you like a legend indicating which color represents each gender?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Should the y-axis display any specific range or increments for salary amounts?

  8. Do you want gridlines on the chart to help with readability?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific sectors or data points to emphasize
  discrepancies?

  10. Is there any additional text or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?'
