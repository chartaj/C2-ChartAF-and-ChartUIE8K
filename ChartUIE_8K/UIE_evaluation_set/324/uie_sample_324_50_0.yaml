initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for Quantum Decision-Making analyzing Temperature
  vs. Pressure. Use annotations to highlight high Entanglement Levels and low External
  Observers. Ensure color contrast to differentiate these segments clearly for visual
  emphasis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What color contrasts do you prefer to highlight high Entanglement Levels?

  3. What color contrasts do you prefer to highlight low External Observers?

  4. Do you prefer a specific annotation style or format?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend or color bar for easier interpretation?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size in the annotations?

  7. Would you like the heatmap to display gridlines for better visual separation?

  8. Do you have a preference for the range of values in the color scale?

  9. Should any additional labels or titles be included on the heatmap?

  10. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be aggregated or binned?'
