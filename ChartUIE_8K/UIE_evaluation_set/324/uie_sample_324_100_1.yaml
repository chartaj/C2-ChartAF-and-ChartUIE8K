initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the data on quantum decision-making.
  Focus on the 'Outcome' column, showing the count of 'Yes' versus 'No' decisions.
  Highlight bars with different colors to distinguish between 'Yes' and 'No'. Annotate
  bars with the count values for better clarity. This will help emphasize the distribution
  of outcomes in the decision-making process. Use the 'Temperature' and 'Pressure'
  columns to add a textual note explaining their potential impact on outcomes. The
  purpose is to make it easier to understand how often each outcome occurs under varying
  conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the ''Yes'' and ''No''
  bars?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the annotations on the bars?

  3. Should the textual note on ''Temperature'' and ''Pressure'' be placed in a specific
  location on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the text annotations (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical)?

  5. Are there any specific legends or labels you would like to add to enhance clarity?

  6. What level of detail do you want in the textual notes explaining the impact of
  ''Temperature'' and ''Pressure''?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines? If so, do you have a preference for their
  style or color?

  8. Do you prefer the bars to be placed side-by-side or stacked?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the font style and size for the annotations.

  3. I do not know where the textual note should be placed on the chart.

  4. I prefer horizontal text annotations.

  5. I do not have any specific legends or labels in mind.

  6. I would like a basic explanation of the impact of ''Temperature'' and ''Pressure''.

  7. I am not sure about including grid lines.

  8. I prefer the bars to be placed side-by-side.'
