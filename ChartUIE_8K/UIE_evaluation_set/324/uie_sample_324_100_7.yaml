initial_prompt: I need a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of 'Outcome' from
  the 'Quantum Decision-Making' dataset. Specifically, I want to see the proportions
  of 'Yes' and 'No' outcomes. I believe this will help understand the overall success
  rate of quantum decisions. Please use the 'Outcome' column data from the provided
  dataset to create this pie chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels showing the percentage for each ''Outcome''?

  3. Do you want the pie chart to have a legend, or should labels be placed directly
  on the pie slices?

  4. Should the pie chart include a title? If so, what should the title be?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  6. Would you like the chart to include annotations or additional information about
  each outcome category?

  7. Do you want to emphasize any part of the pie chart, such as highlighting a specific
  outcome?

  8. Should the chart include a description or footnote explaining the dataset or
  results?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would like data labels showing the percentage for each ''Outcome''.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Quantum Decision-Making Outcomes".

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No, I have no specific preference.

  8. No, I do not think a description or footnote is necessary.'
