initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the "Quantum Decision-Making"
  data provided. For the x-axis, use "Temperature," and for the y-axis, use "Pressure."
  Color the points based on the "Outcome" column (Yes/No) and use different shapes
  for different "Decision Superposition" values. The data involve physics, so it should
  look professional and clean. Ensure the chart includes proper axis labels, a legend,
  and a title. I want to understand how the temperature and pressure relate to the
  decision outcomes visually. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the "Outcome" categories
  (Yes/No)?

  2. Do you have specific shapes in mind for different "Decision Superposition" values?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels, title, and
  legend?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the plot for better visualization of data points?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the positioning of the legend on the chart (e.g.,
  top-right, bottom-left)?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations or notes added to the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?'

  1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like gridlines on the plot.

  5. I prefer the legend to be in the top-right.

  6. No, I do not want any specific annotations or notes added.

  7. I do not have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions.
