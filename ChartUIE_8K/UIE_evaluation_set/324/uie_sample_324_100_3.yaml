initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart that visualizes the 'Temperature', 'Pressure',
  and 'Entanglement Level' from the quantum decision-making dataset. Use each category
  along the x-axis and represent them separately with different box plots. This will
  help compare their distributions, including median, interquartile range, and any
  outliers within this physics-focused dataset. Please label axes clearly and ensure
  the box plots are color-coded for easy differentiation. This visualization will
  assist in understanding the variability and central tendencies among these key parameters,
  which are crucial in the quantum decision-making process.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Would you like any specific colors to represent each of the data attributes?

  3. Should the median, quartiles, and any outliers be highlighted in a particular
  way?

  4. Would you prefer any specific fonts for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Do you want to include a legend indicating which color corresponds to each data
  attribute?

  6. Should the chart title explicitly mention the data attributes being compared?

  7. Are there any specific axis scales or ranges you would like to set for either
  axis?

  8. Would you prefer grid lines in the background to aid in visual alignment?

  9. Do you need any specific annotations or labels for the median or outliers in
  the box plots?

  10. Are there any other specific formatting preferences for the box plots (e.g.,
  box width, whisker length)?'
