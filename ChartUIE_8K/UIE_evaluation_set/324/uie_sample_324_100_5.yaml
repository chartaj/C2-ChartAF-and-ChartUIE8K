initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of 'Temperature'
  and 'Pressure' across different 'Q-States' from the Quantum Decision-Making data
  set in the physics domain. Make sure to include separate histograms for 'Temperature'
  and 'Pressure' with appropriate bin sizes. Additionally, color-code the histograms
  based on the 'Outcome' (Yes/No) to compare the distributions for different outcomes.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the value ranges for 'Temperature' and 'Pressure,'
  while the y-axis shows the frequency of each range. Include proper labels and legends
  for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the ''Outcome'' (Yes/No) in the histograms?

  2. What bin sizes would you consider appropriate for the ''Temperature'' and ''Pressure''
  histograms, or would you like to leave the bin size determination to the analyst''s
  discretion?

  3. Are there specific labels or titles you would like to use for the x-axis and
  y-axis for both ''Temperature'' and ''Pressure'' histograms?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement within the histograms?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size that you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or markers to be included in the histograms
  to highlight specific value ranges or outcomes?

  7. Do you have a specific layout preference for displaying the histograms (e.g.,
  side-by-side or stacked vertically)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, you can choose whatever looks best.

  2. I am not sure, please use your best judgment for the bin sizes.

  3. No specific preference for labels or titles.

  4. I do not know about the legend placement, you can decide.

  5. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  6. I do not know about additional annotations or markers.

  7. I have no specific preference for the layout, please choose what you think is
  most effective.'
