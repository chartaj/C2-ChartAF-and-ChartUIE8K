initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the Boston House Prices
  data, focusing on the relationship between 'RM' (average number of rooms per dwelling)
  and 'MEDV' (median value of owner-occupied homes). Include data-driven text annotations
  to highlight key data points, especially those with extreme 'MEDV' values (both
  high and low). Use highlights to distinguish different values of 'RAD' (index of
  accessibility to radial highways) by color. The purpose is to understand how room
  numbers and radial highway accessibility affect house prices. This will help in
  real-estate analysis and decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used to distinguish
  different values of ''RAD''?

  2. Would you like to specify particular shapes or sizes for data points based on
  any criteria?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations for key data points to be formatted
  (e.g., font size, color, background)?

  4. Do you have a specific layout preference for the chart (e.g., axis titles, gridlines)?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or titles included in the chart (e.g., chart
  title, axis labels)?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Is there any particular aspect ratio or size you prefer for the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the highlight of extremes ''MEDV''
  values?'
