initial_prompt: I need a pie chart visualizing the proportion of unique values for
  each column in the dataset. Highlight the columns 'CRIM', 'ZN', and 'INDUS' because
  they seem to have varying data that might provide interesting insights. Include
  text annotations for these highlights to show how many unique values each has. This
  visualization should help identify which aspects of Boston housing data have the
  most variability, aiding in understanding real estate trends and making data-driven
  decisions. Ensure the chart is colorful and visually appealing for easier interpretation
  of the data variations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like a legend included in the chart? If so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout and placement of the text
  annotations?

  5. Should the chart have a title and/or caption? If yes, please provide the details.
