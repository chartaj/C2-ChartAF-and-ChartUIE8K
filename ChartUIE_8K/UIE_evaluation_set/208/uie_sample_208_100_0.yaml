initial_prompt: Visualize the Boston Housing dataset using a box plot for each numerical
  column, particularly focusing on columns like 'MEDV'. Use text annotations to highlight
  the median, outliers, and skewness in each box plot to emphasize the distribution
  and variation. Highlight the box plot for 'RM' and 'LSTAT' for a deeper visual analysis,
  distinguishing elements using different colors. The purpose is to understand the
  distribution of housing prices and their determining factors, making it easier to
  spot trends and anomalies in the data. This visualization aims to provide insights
  pertinent to real estate market analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  in the box plots?

  2. Would you like the text annotations to be positioned in a particular way (e.g.,
  above the median, near outliers)?

  3. Is there a specific way you would like the box plots for ''RM'' and ''LSTAT''
  to be highlighted (e.g., thicker borders, different background)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific fonts or sizes for the text annotations?

  5. Should we include gridlines or any background shading to enhance the readability
  of the box plots?

  6. Are there any additional statistical metrics or information you would like to
  include in the box plots (e.g., quartiles, mean)?

  7. Do you have a preferred order for the columns in the visualization, or should
  they be arranged in any specific sequence (e.g., ascending MEDV)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding and annotations
  used in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Above the median would be great.

  3. Different background for ''RM'' and ''LSTAT'' sounds good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful.

  6. The mean would be a nice addition.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, a legend would be useful.'
