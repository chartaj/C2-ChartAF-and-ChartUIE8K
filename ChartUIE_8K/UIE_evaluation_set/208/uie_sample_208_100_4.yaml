initial_prompt: I want a histogram for the Boston House Prices dataset. Use the MEDV
  column (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s) for the X-axis to show the
  distribution of house prices. Ensure the Y-axis represents the frequency of occurrences
  of these house prices. This will help visualize the spread and common value ranges
  in the Boston housing market, making it practical for understanding the market distribution.
  Include appropriate labels and titles to make the chart clear and informative. Use
  bins that best represent the range of house prices.
questions: '1. What specific title would you like for the histogram?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the labels on the X and Y axes?

  3. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  4. Do you prefer a specific number of bins, or should it be automatically determined
  based on the data range?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should any specific value ranges or thresholds be highlighted on the histogram?

  7. Do you want any annotations or additional information displayed on the chart?'
