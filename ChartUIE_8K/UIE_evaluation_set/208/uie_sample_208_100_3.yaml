initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between the
  different variables in the Boston House Prices dataset. Make sure to include all
  columns: CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT,
  and MEDV. Use a color gradient to indicate the strength of the correlations. Data
  details indicate it''s related to real estate prices, so the relationship between
  MEDV (home prices) and other variables is critical. Ensure the heatmap is clear,
  with labels and a legend for easy interpretation of data strengths and weaknesses
  in their correlations.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific correlation thresholds to be highlighted with different
  colors?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the ordering of the variables on the x
  and y axes?

  4. Should the heatmap include numerical correlation values within the cells?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation (landscape or portrait) for the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific axis label formats or font styles/sizes you prefer?

  7. Would you like to add any titles or subtitles to the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette for the heatmap.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include numerical correlation values within the cells.

  5. I do not have a specific orientation preference for the heatmap.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please add a title: "Correlation Heatmap of Boston House Prices Dataset".

  8. I have no specific preference for the legend placement.'
