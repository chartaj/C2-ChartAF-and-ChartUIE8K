initial_prompt: I have a dataset from the Boston House Prices-Advanced Regression
  Techniques which contains columns like CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, etc. I would
  like to create a bar chart to compare the average MEDV (Median value of owner-occupied
  homes) for different values of CHAS (Charles River dummy variable). This means,
  I want one bar for MEDV where CHAS equals 0, and another bar for MEDV where CHAS
  equals 1. Please ensure the x-axis represents CHAS values and the y-axis shows the
  average MEDV. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show the exact average MEDV
  values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart''s title and axis labels?

  4. Should there be a legend included in the chart, even though there are only two
  bars representing CHAS values?

  5. Do you want any specific gridlines or background color in the chart?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the chart?

  7. How should the chart be titled? Would you like to provide a specific title?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the format of the y-axis labels, such as currency
  or specific number formatting?'
