initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the data summarized in the CSV
  file. The chart should display the 'REPORTDATE' on the x-axis and 'VALUE' on the
  y-axis. Use text annotations to highlight specific data points, like those on 30.12.2013,
  31.12.2013, and 01.01.2014, showing their corresponding values. The data is business-related
  from a virtual internship at Sberbank, so the goal is to easily identify trends
  or significant changes over time. Use highlights to emphasize noteworthy dates or
  values, making it easier to spot patterns and draw insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the x-axis display dates in a specific format (e.g., DD.MM.YYYY)?

  3. Would you like a specific title for the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart texts?

  5. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scale?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be on both axes or just
  one?

  7. Should the highlighted noteworthy dates have a special color or marker?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart?

  9. Do you prefer data labels to be displayed on the bars?

  10. Should the annotations be in a specific position relative to the highlighted
  data points?'
