initial_prompt: I have data that includes report dates and their corresponding values
  from a Sberbank internship project. Please create a scatter plot where the x-axis
  represents the REPORTDATE and the y-axis represents the VALUE. Ensure that the dates
  are correctly formatted in a chronological order on the x-axis, and the values are
  accurately plotted on the y-axis. Highlight trends if any, and ensure the chart
  is clean and easy to read, with labeled axes and title. The scatter plot should
  help visualizing any patterns or anomalies in the data over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have a preferred color for the data points?

  4. Should the trend line be a specific color or style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  5. Would you prefer a particular format for the dates on the x-axis (e.g., DD.MM.YYYY,
  MM/DD/YYYY)?

  6. Should gridlines be included on the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size of the labels
  and title?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to be set for the axes?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations for specific data points?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall theme or style of the chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed)?'
