initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing 'REPORTDATE' on the x-axis and 'VALUE'
  on the y-axis from the provided dataset. Highlight any noticeable trends or outliers
  over time, ensuring to adjust scales for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like specific markers or shapes for identifying outliers in the scatter
  plot?

  3. Do you prefer any specific trend line types (e.g., linear, moving average) to
  be added to the scatter plot?

  4. Should the x-axis have specific date intervals or labels for clarity?

  5. How should outlier points be highlighted (e.g., different color, larger size)?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included for better readability of the plot?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the plot title or axis labels?

  8. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  9. Do you want to include data point labels or tooltips for additional information
  on hover?

  10. Should the axes be scaled logarithmically or linearly for better visualization
  of trends and outliers?'
