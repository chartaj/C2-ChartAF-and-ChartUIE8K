initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize the data with 'REPORTDATE' on the
  x-axis and 'VALUE' on the y-axis. Highlight the trends over time by showing daily
  data points clearly. Use text annotations to highlight significant dates with unusually
  high or low values, drawing attention to these specific data points. The chart should
  help identify patterns and anomalies over the given period, which is crucial for
  understanding business trends as part of my virtual internship at Sberbank. Include
  a legend to differentiate between years, focusing on overall visual clarity and
  impact.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the area fills to differentiate
  between the years?

  2. What specific dates would you like to highlight with text annotations for unusually
  high or low values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the x-axis be formatted in a particular way (e.g., display format for
  dates)?

  5. Do you have any preference for the scale of the y-axis (linear or logarithmic)?

  6. Would you prefer a specific style for the legend (e.g., its position and layout)?

  7. Is there a specific width and height you want for the chart to ensure it fits
  your presentation or report?

  8. Do you want grid lines to be included or excluded in the display of the chart?

  9. Do you have any margin or padding preferences around the areas of the chart?

  10. Would you like markers on data points to be included or excluded on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the specific dates; please identify and annotate dates with
  the most significant high and low values based on the data.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size for the text annotations.

  4. I would like the x-axis to display dates in a clear and easy-to-read format,
  maybe month and day.

  5. I am not sure about the preference for the y-axis scale.

  6. I would prefer the legend to be positioned at the bottom or side, but I am open
  to suggestions.

  7. I do not know the exact dimensions, but it should fit well in a standard presentation
  slide or report.

  8. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  9. I do not have any specific margin or padding preferences.

  10. Yes, I would like markers on data points to be included for clarity.'
