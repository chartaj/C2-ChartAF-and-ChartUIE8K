initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Create a treemap visualizing the favorite music genres of different age groups from
  the Music & Mental Health Survey Results. Highlight the genres with the most and
  least frequency. Annotate the treemap with information about how often these genres
  are listened to by respondents. Focus on drawing attention to genres like Rock,
  Latin, and Video game music. This will help understand the musical preferences of
  different demographics and their potential impact on mental health.
