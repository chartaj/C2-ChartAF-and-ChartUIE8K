initial_prompt: I need a box chart that shows the distribution of "Hours per day"
  spent on music streaming among different age groups. Please plot "Age" on the x-axis
  and "Hours per day" on the y-axis. In addition, use different colors to differentiate
  between the "Primary streaming service" categories such as Spotify, Pandora, etc.
  This way, I can understand how different age groups allocate their time to streaming
  music and if there's any preference for a particular streaming service among them.
  Please make sure to clearly label the axes and include a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  between the streaming services?

  2. What age group intervals would you like to use on the x-axis (e.g., 10-19, 20-29,
  etc.)?

  3. Is there a preferred order in which the streaming services should be displayed
  in the legend?

  4. Would you prefer horizontal or vertical whiskers for the box plot?

  5. Do you want to include any statistical annotations on the box chart (e.g., mean,
  median)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like for the axes and legend?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and legends?

  8. Would you like to see a grid on the chart background for better readability?

  9. Should outliers be displayed differently on the box plot (e.g., different color
  or shape)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the overall aspect ratio or size of the chart?'
