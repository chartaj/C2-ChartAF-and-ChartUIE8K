initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the frequency of different music genres listened
  to by participants against their mental health metrics (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia,
  OCD). Use color gradients to represent the frequency scales and mental health scores.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color gradient used to represent the
  frequency scales and mental health scores?

  2. What range or threshold of frequencies and scores do you want to be highlighted
  or emphasized in the heatmap?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for the exact frequency and mental health scores,
  or do you prefer a more general overview?

  4. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the different levels of frequency
  and mental health scores?

  5. How would you like the axes to be labeled (e.g., specific genre names, mental
  health metrics names)?

  6. Would you prefer the color gradient to be sequential, diverging, or qualitative?

  7. Should there be a legend included to explain the color gradients and their corresponding
  values?

  8. Do you want the heatmap to display any specific patterns or trends explicitly,
  such as high positive or negative correlations?

  9. Are there any specific genres or mental health metrics you want to be grouped
  together or compared directly on the heatmap?

  10. Do you have any preference for the layout of the heatmap (e.g., size, orientation)?'
