initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the frequency of different music
  genres listened to by individuals surveyed in the Music & Mental Health Survey.
  Use the "Frequency [Classical]", "Frequency [Country]", "Frequency [EDM]", etc.,
  columns to populate the rows, and the respondent IDs for the columns. Color-code
  based on the frequency levels (e.g., "Never", "Rarely", "Sometimes", "Very frequently").
  This will help in understanding the general trends and preferences in music genres
  among different age groups and their potential effects on mental health metrics
  like Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer the heatmap to display the data with a specific gradient or
  with distinct color bands for each frequency level?

  3. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or labels on the axes?

  4. Do you have any preference for the arrangement or sorting of the rows and columns?

  5. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or legends in
  the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific genres or individuals you would like to highlight or focus
  on within the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and titles in the
  heatmap?

  8. Would you like the heatmap to have gridlines or any other visual separators?

  9. Should the mental health metrics (Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, OCD) be integrated
  or indicated in the heatmap in any specific way?

  10. Is there any specific aspect of the data you would like to emphasize or make
  more prominent in the visualization?'
