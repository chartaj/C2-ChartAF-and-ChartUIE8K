initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing the frequency of different
  genres listened to by age group. Each genre like Classical, Country, EDM, etc.,
  should have bars representing age categories (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.). Include
  annotations to highlight the most and least listened genres in each age category.
  This will help understand music preferences across different age groups and how
  they potentially correlate with mental health metrics such as anxiety, depression,
  insomnia, and OCD. The chart should provide a clear visual distribution and emphasis
  on differences in musical taste by age.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Are there specific labels or titles you would like for the axes and the chart?

  3. How would you like the age categories to be grouped (e.g., 18-25, 26-35)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a legend? If so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Do you want grid lines or not in the chart?

  7. Is there a specific order in which the genres should be displayed?

  8. Would you like to display the exact frequency values on each bar?

  9. Do you want to use predefined colors for specific genres?

  10. Should the bars be displayed with a specific width or spacing between them?'
