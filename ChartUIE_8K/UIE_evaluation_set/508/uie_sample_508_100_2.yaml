initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between
  "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" and "Biodiversity (sp*yr*10^14)"
  using the provided data. Annotate data points for different countries by using text
  annotations for values and highlights to emphasize countries with the highest and
  lowest emissions. The purpose of this visualization is to understand the environmental
  impact of different products on greenhouse gas emissions and biodiversity. This
  is part of a larger analysis related to sustainability in food and drink production,
  specifically focusing on their ecological footprint.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Should the text annotations include any additional information besides the country
  names and values?

  3. Do you want a specific style for the data point markers (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  4. What level of detail should the axis labels include (e.g., scientific notation,
  specific decimal places)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, what details should it contain?

  6. Is there a preferred font type and size for text annotations and labels?

  7. Should the scatter plot include gridlines, and if so, what style do you prefer
  for them?

  8. Do you want to include any specific titles or subtitles on the chart?

  9. Should there be any specific annotations or highlights for countries other than
  those with the highest and lowest emissions?

  10. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the chart (e.g., landscape
  or portrait)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer circles for the data point markers.

  4. Scientific notation for the axis labels would be good.

  5. Yes, please include a legend that details what the colors and markers represent.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, include gridlines; a light, dotted style would be fine.

  8. Yes, please include the title "Environmental Impact of Food and Drink Production"
  and a subtitle "GHG Emissions vs. Biodiversity".

  9. I do not know.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
