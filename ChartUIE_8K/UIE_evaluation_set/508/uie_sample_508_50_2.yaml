initial_prompt: Let's visualize the "Land Use (m2*year)" against "GHG Emissions (kg
  CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for various products. Use scatter plot to highlight
  specific products from different countries. Annotate points with high GHG emissions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the scatter
  plot?

  2. How would you like the specific products from different countries to be highlighted
  (e.g., different marker shapes, colors, or sizes)?

  3. Are there particular threshold values for GHG emissions that you consider "high"
  and would like annotated?

  4. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the annotations of high GHG
  emissions points?

  5. Would you prefer to include grid lines on the chart, or would you like them removed
  for clarity?

  6. Should the axes have specific ranges or scales (e.g., logarithmic scale)?

  7. Do you want any specific labels or titles for the axes and the chart itself?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate the products from various
  countries? If so, any specific preferences for it?

  9. Are there any other specific data points or trends you would like highlighted
  or emphasized in the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the scatter plot to include trend lines to illustrate correlations?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Different marker shapes and colors.

  3. Products with GHG emissions above 1000 kg CO2eq.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please label the axes accordingly: "Land Use (m2*year)" and "GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" and title the chart "Land Use vs GHG Emissions
  for Various Products".

  8. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate the products from various countries.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
