initial_prompt: Create a matrix chart to compare the environmental impact metrics
  (e.g., Land Use, GHG Emissions) of different bread products across various countries.
  Highlight significant differences and annotate extreme values for emphasis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the matrix chart?

  2. Would you like the differences to be highlighted using specific colors or gradients?

  3. Should the extreme values be annotated with text labels, icons, or special markers?

  4. Do you want any specific aggregation or averaging methods for the data points?

  5. Are there any specific countries or bread products you would like to focus on
  or exclude?

  6. How would you prefer the data to be sorted in the matrix chart (e.g., by country,
  by product, by impact metric)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the layout of the matrix chart (e.g., clustering
  similar countries together, clustering similar products together)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional environmental impact metrics other than
  ''Land Use'' and ''GHG Emissions''?'
