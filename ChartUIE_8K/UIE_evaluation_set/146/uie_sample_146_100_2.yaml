initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the 2024 Lok Sabha election
  results, highlighting the margins of victory. Use the x-axis for 'Leading Party',
  the y-axis for 'Margin', and color-code points by 'Status' (e.g., Result Declared).
  Add data-driven text annotations to highlight top margins, ensuring key details
  stand out to help viewers understand election dynamics. This visualization should
  illustrate party performance and competitive races, making it easy to compare margins
  across parties. Include context through non-data annotations if necessary. This
  will help in quickly grasping which seats had the highest and lowest victory margins.
