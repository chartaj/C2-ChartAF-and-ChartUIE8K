initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the 2024 Lok Sabha election results
  in India. Use constituency names as labels, with each block representing a different
  constituency. The size of each block should reflect the margin of victory. Color-code
  the blocks by the leading party to differentiate between Bharatiya Janata Party,
  Indian National Congress, and others. Include leading and trailing candidates' names,
  and status ('Result Declared') in the details on hover. This will help give a clear
  visual representation of the election outcomes and margins across various constituencies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different parties?

  2. Should the margin of victory be displayed as exact numbers or represented proportionally
  within the block size?

  3. How would you like the constituency labels to be displayed for better readability?

  4. Do you want the leading and trailing candidates'' names displayed directly on
  the blocks or only on hover?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the constituencies to be arranged?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text labels in the treemap?

  7. Should the "Result Declared" status be shown prominently, or only on hover?

  8. Are there any specific visual elements or annotations you want to include on
  the treemap for enhancing the interpretation of data?

  9. What level of detail would you like for the hover details (e.g., only candidate
  names and status, or include margin and party names as well)?'
