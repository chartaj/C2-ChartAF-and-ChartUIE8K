initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showcasing the leading political party for
  each constituency in the 2024 Lok Sabha Election results. Color-code the map based
  on the leading party, illustrating their strongholds and areas of influence across
  the country. Highlight the margin of victory by varying the intensity of the color.
