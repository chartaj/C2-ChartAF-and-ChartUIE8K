initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the 2024 Lok Sabha election
  results in India by constituency. Each bar should represent a constituency, with
  segments indicating the vote margins between the leading and trailing candidates.
  Differentiating colors should represent the leading and trailing parties, allowing
  a clear comparison of party performance across constituencies. Ensure the chart
  highlights whether results are declared. Also, add labels for constituencies and
  candidates to make the chart informative. This chart will help analyze party dominance
  and voter preferences in various regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating between
  the leading and trailing parties?

  2. How would you prefer the constituencies to be labeled: abbreviated names or full
  names?

  3. Should the candidate names be displayed alongside the constituency labels, or
  would you like them as tooltips?

  4. Do you prefer to see the exact vote margins as labels on the bars or just the
  visual comparison?

  5. How would you like the "Status" of results (e.g., "Result Declared") to be highlighted
  on the chart?

  6. Would you like to see any specific legend or key included to explain the colors
  and segments?

  7. Do you prefer the bars to be sorted in any specific order, e.g., by margin size,
  alphabetically by constituency, or by leading party?'
