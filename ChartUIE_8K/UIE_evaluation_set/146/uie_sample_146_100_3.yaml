initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped column chart to visualize the leading and trailing
  candidate margins for each constituency in the Lok Sabha Election Results 2024 dataset.
  The X-axis should represent different constituencies. Each constituency group should
  have two columns: one for the margin of the leading candidate and one for the trailing
  candidate. Use different colors to differentiate between the leading and trailing
