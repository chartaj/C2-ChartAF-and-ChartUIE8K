initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to visualize the trade volume between different
  countries including the USA, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India. Each bubble
  should represent a country pair, its size indicating the trade volume. The x and
  y axes should represent the countries in pairs. Please use distinct colors for each
  bubble to differentiate the countries. This will help us understand the trade relationships
  and the volume flow between these countries quickly. Highlight any significant trade
  volumes with larger bubbles. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the scale of the x-axis and y-axis
  (linear, logarithmic, etc.)?

  2. Do you have any color preferences for the distinct bubbles representing each
  country?

  3. Would you like specific labels or annotations on the bubbles to indicate the
  trade volume values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific bubble sizes to represent trade volumes more effectively?

  5. Are there any particular country pairs or trade volumes you want to emphasize
  or highlight?

  6. Do you have a preferred arrangement for the country pairs on the x and y axes?

  7. Would you like a legend or tooltip to help interpret the chart?'
