  volumes as child nodes. Represent volume by size.

  2. Would you like to include labels directly on the treemap nodes? If yes, what\
  \ information should these labels contain?\n3. Do you have a preference for the\
  \ hierarchical structure style (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?\n4. Should the\
  \ treemap include any tooltips or hover effects that display additional information\
  \ for each node?\n5. Are there any specific font preferences for labels or titles\
  \ within the chart?\n6. Do you want to include a legend or key to explain the color/type\
  \ of nodes?\n7. Would you prefer any specific border styles or separations between\
  \ the different nodes?\n8. Is there a particular title or subtitle you'd like to\
  \ have on the chart? If yes, please provide the exact text.\n9. Should the chart\
  \ include any axes or scales, or should it strictly focus on the treemap representation?\
  \ \n10. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout, such as the size or\
  \ aspect ratio of the chart?"
