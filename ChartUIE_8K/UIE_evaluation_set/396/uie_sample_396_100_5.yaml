initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the trade volume between different countries
  using a heatmap. The data includes trade volumes between the USA, China, Germany,
  Brazil, Japan, and India. Since each cell represents trade volumes, a heatmap with
  varying color intensities will be ideal. For instance, cells representing higher
  trade volumes should have a darker shade, and lower volumes should be lighter. This
  will help to quickly grasp which countries have the highest and lowest trade interactions.
  Could you please create this heatmap for me and ensure each country is clearly labeled
  on both axes? Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include data labels showing the exact trade volumes within
  each cell?

  3. Is there a preferred ordering for the countries on the axes?

  4. Would you like to include any particular annotations or highlights for the highest
  and lowest trade volumes?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style and size for the country labels on both axes?

  6. Should there be a legend or color bar to indicate the scale of trade volume?

  7. Are there any specific axis titles or captions you would like to add to the heatmap?'
