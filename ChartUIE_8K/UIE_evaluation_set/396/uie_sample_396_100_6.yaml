initial_prompt: I need a Treemap chart to visualize trade volume data between different
  countries as provided in the data format. Specifically, the chart should represent
  the trade volumes between the USA, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India. Each
  country should be a segment, and the size of each segment should be proportional
  to the trade volume. This visualization will help us better understand trade relationships
  and the relative volume each country holds. Please also ensure that missing and
  unique values are considered to avoid data inaccuracies. The data should be clear
  and insightful for government analysis of international trade.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the Treemap chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels within each segment, and if so, what specific
  information should they display?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text within the
  chart?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout for the segments (e.g., squarified, slice and
  dice)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  6. Do you want to include tooltips to display additional information when hovering
  over each segment?

  7. Are there any specific trade volume ranges within the data that you would like
  to highlight or use different colors for?

  8. Should the chart title or any other annotations be included, and if so, what
  should they be?'
