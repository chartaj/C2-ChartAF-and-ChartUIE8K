initial_prompt: I need a line chart illustrating the trade volume between different
  countries over time. Specifically, I want to see how trade volume changes between
  the USA, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India. The x-axis should represent the
  timeline (e.g., years or months), while the y-axis should represent the trade volume.
  Each country should be depicted with a unique line color for clarity. It's important
  to show how each country's trade dynamics fluctuate in comparison to others, highlighting
  any trends or significant changes over the period. This chart is for a government
  report on international trade.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred time interval for the x-axis (e.g., yearly,
  monthly)?

  2. Are there any specific years or months you want to focus on or exclude?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme or specific colors for each
  country line?

  4. Would you prefer the chart to include markers at data points in addition to the
  lines?

  5. Do you need gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the chart include annotations or labels for significant events or changes
  in trade volume?

  7. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Would you like to see trend lines or moving averages in addition to the raw data
  lines?

  9. Should the y-axis be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  10. Do you need any specific formatting for the axis labels and titles?'
