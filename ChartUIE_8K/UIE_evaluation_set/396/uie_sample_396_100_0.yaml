initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the trade volume between countries:
  USA, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India. Use points to represent the trade
  volumes between each pair of countries. Highlight significant trade relationships
  by modifying the color or size of the points. Annotate the plot with specific values
  for notable trade volumes to focus attention on key data points. Ensure the chart
  clearly shows the relationships and allows for easy comparison. Contextual information
  may include the purpose of trade or strategic partnerships. This will help understand
  government-level trade interactions.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant trade
  relationships?

  2. Would you like us to use different shapes for the points representing different
  countries or keep them uniform?

  3. How many notable trade volumes would you like to be annotated on the plot?

  4. Do you prefer the size of the points to represent the magnitude of trade volumes,
  or should we stick to color modifications only?

  5. Should the annotations include additional information such as the purpose of
  trade or strategic partnerships, or only the trade volumes?

  6. Are there specific countries or pairs you want us to emphasize apart from the
  significant trade relationships?

  7. Do you need a legend to explain the color and size variations used in the plot?

  8. Should the axes be labeled with country names or trade volume values, or both?

  9. Would you like grid lines on the scatter plot to aid in better comparison of
  trade volumes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Keep them uniform.

  3. Annotate 5 notable trade volumes.

  4. Prefer the size of the points to represent the magnitude of trade volumes.

  5. Only the trade volumes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. Both.

  9. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.'
