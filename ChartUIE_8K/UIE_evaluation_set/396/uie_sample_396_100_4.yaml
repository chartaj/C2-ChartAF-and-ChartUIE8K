initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the trade volumes between different
  countries from the provided data. Each bar should represent a country (USA, China,
  Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India), and the height of the bar should correspond
  to the trade volume. The chart should display the trade volumes for each country
  clearly, with different colors used for each country for better distinction. Also,
  please add appropriate labels for the x-axis (Country names) and y-axis (Trade Volume)
  to ensure the data is easily interpretable. Title the chart as "Trade Volume Between
  Countries".
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette you would like to use for the
  different countries?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels and title?

  3. Do you want to display the exact trade volume values on top of each bar?

  4. Would you prefer a vertical or horizontal bar chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the countries to be displayed on
  the x-axis?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the chart? If so, what style and color should they be?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or additional information on the chart?'
