initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing 'bytes_in' and 'bytes_out' for
  each 'src_ip_country_code' with the time period. Use text annotations to highlight
  'src_ip' values with highest traffic. The goal is to detect and highlight significant
  'Adversary Infrastructure Interaction' to improve monitoring and defensive measures.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the stacked bar chart?

  2. What time granularity would you prefer for the time period? (e.g., hourly, daily,
  weekly)

  3. Is there a specific order you would like the ''src_ip_country_code'' categories
  to be displayed in?

  4. Do you want any legends or labels to be included or excluded?

  5. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  6. Should the chart include a title and axis labels, and if so, what should they
  be?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart dimensions or aspect ratio?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds or criteria for highlighting the ''src_ip''
  values with the highest traffic?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  10. Should the chart include any additional elements, such as data labels or percentage
  values on the bars?
