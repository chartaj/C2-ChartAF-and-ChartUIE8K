initial_prompt: Visualize a geographic heatmap showing suspicious web traffic, highlighting
  src_ip locations. Annotate unique src_ip countries, and emphasize high-byte traffic,
  particularly from AE, US, and CA. Highlight the interaction occurrences over time
  to spot trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific color gradient for representing the intensity of traffic
  on the heatmap?

  3. Do you have a preferred map style (e.g., satellite, roadmap, dark mode)?

  4. Should the src_ip locations be represented with specific markers or symbols?

  5. How would you like high-byte traffic to be emphasized (e.g., different color
  scale, larger markers)?

  6. Do you prefer the country annotations to include specific details such as number
  of interactions or total bytes?

  7. Do you want to see the trend over time as a separate line chart or integrated
  within the map?

  8. Is there a preferred time interval for displaying interaction occurrences over
  time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)?

  9. Would you like any additional filters (e.g., by src_ip_country_code)?

  10. Are there any specific legends or labels you want included on the map?

  11. Do you prefer a static or dynamically updating heatmap for real-time monitoring?

  12. Should there be a tooltip or pop-up information for each src_ip location on
  the map?'
