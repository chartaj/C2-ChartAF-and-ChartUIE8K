initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the number of interactions by 'src_ip_country_code'.
  The chart should display the country codes on the x-axis and the count of interactions
  on the y-axis. This will help in understanding which countries are generating the
  most suspicious web traffic interactions. Use different colors for each bar to make
  it visually appealing and clear. Make sure to label the axes and provide a concise
  title for the chart, such as "Suspicious Web Interactions by Country." This will
  aid in quickly identifying potential threats based on their origin.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for each bar?

  2. What font style or size would you prefer for the chart title and axis labels?

  3. Is there a specific chart background color or gridline preference you have?

  4. Do you want to include data labels on each bar to show the exact count of interactions?

  5. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the bar chart?

  6. Should the bars be sorted in ascending or descending order based on the count
  of interactions?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart legend, if needed?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include on
  the chart?'
