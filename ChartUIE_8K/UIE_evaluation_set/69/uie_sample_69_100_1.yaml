initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize bytes_in versus bytes_out across
  multiple suspicious web traffic interactions for different source IPs. Highlight
  points from specific countries (e.g., AE, US, CA) to distinguish them. Annotate
  points with creation_time to track temporal trends. This will help us identify patterns
  and anomalies related to adversary infrastructure interactions flagged by WAF rules,
  focusing on AWS VPC Flow data from our prod_webserver. Include descriptive text
  to explain key findings and observations. Use varying colors and sizes to emphasize
  data points with different response codes and src_ip_country_code.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the specific color palette used for\
  \ distinguishing different 'src_ip_country_code'?\n2. How would you like the sizes\
  \ of the data points to be differentiated (e.g., by 'response.code' values)? \n\
  3. Should the axes have a specific scale (linear or logarithmic)?\n4. Do you prefer\
  \ any particular font style or size for the annotations and descriptive text?\n\
  5. Is there a specific format you would like for the 'creation_time' annotations\
  \ (e.g., full timestamp, just date)?\n6. Should the highlighted points for specific\
  \ countries (AE, US, CA) have any additional markers or styles beyond color?\n7.\
  \ Do you have any specific requirements for the legend design and placement?\n8.\
  \ Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the scatter plot, and if so, should\
  \ they be in a specific style or color?\n9. Is there a preferred range or limit\
  \ for the 'bytes_in' and 'bytes_out' axes based on your data analysis needs?\n10.\
  \ Would you like any specific descriptive texts or labels included besides the key\
  \ findings and observations?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color palette.

  2. I would like the sizes of the data points to be differentiated by ''response.code''
  values.

  3. I am not sure about the axis scale.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  5. Full timestamp for the ''creation_time'' annotations would be preferable.

  6. No specific additional markers or styles for highlighted points from specific
  countries.

  7. I do not have any specific requirements for the legend design and placement.

  8. Yes, I would like gridlines to be displayed; I do not have a preference for style
  or color.

  9. I am not sure about the preferred range or limit for the ''bytes_in'' and ''bytes_out''
  axes.

  10. No specific additional descriptive texts or labels; just key findings and observations.
