initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the distribution of 'bytes_in' for the
  recorded web traffic interactions, grouped by 'src_ip_country_code'. This will help
  visualize the volume of incoming data from different countries interacting with
  the web server. Use data from '69.csv' in the context of examining suspicious web
  threat interactions related to cybersecurity. Ensure the x-axis represents 'bytes_in'
  and the y-axis represents the count. Differentiate countries using distinct colors.
  This will help in identifying patterns or anomalies in network traffic based on
  origin countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  countries?

  2. What color palette would you like to use for the histogram?

  3. Would you prefer any specific bin size or binning method for the ''bytes_in''
  distribution?

  4. Is there a particular title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific labels you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Should any legend format preferences be applied to differentiate the countries?

  7. Do you have a preferred style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  professional)?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart? If so, any preferences for
  their style or color?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or markers you want to include on the histogram
  (e.g., average lines, specific thresholds)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the font type, size, or style for the axis labels
  and title?'
