initial_prompt: I need a bar chart comparing the daily closing prices of Bitcoin over
  time. Each bar should represent the closing price in USD for a given date. Additionally,
  I would like to see how the closing prices fluctuate over this period by including
  bars for the highest and lowest prices of each day. Can you also show a separate
  bar depicting the opening price for a comprehensive overview? The labels should
  be clear, and the chart should be easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different bars (closing,
  high, low, and opening prices)?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for easier reading and
  interpretation?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and title?

  4. Should the data points be annotated with their values directly on the bars?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the different types
  of prices (closing, high, low, opening)?

  6. Do you have a preferred orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. How detailed do you want the date labels to be (daily, weekly, or monthly intervals)?

  8. Would you like any reference lines for average or median prices to be included
  on the chart?

  9. Should the bars be grouped by date or stacked on top of each other?

  10. Are there any particular aspects of the data you want to highlight or emphasize?'
