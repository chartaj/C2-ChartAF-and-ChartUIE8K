initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize Bitcoin's price movement over time.
  Use the "Date" on the x-axis and "Closing Price (USD)" on the y-axis. Please highlight
  the points where the 24h High (USD) is significantly higher than the 24h Open (USD)
  and where the 24h Low (USD) is significantly lower than the 24h Open (USD). This
  will help me see the fluctuations during the Bitcoin bull-run periods. Make sure
  the plot is easy to read with clear labels for the axes and a legend that differentiates
  the highlighted points from the rest.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the highlighted points and the
  regular points?

  2. What threshold would you consider for ''significantly higher'' or ''significantly
  lower'' between the 24h High/24h Low and 24h Open?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the scatter plot (e.g., classic,
  modern, minimalist)?

  4. Would you like the data points to be connected with lines, or should it strictly
  be a scatter plot?

  5. How detailed do you want the gridlines on the chart to be (e.g., major gridlines
  only, both major and minor gridlines)?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for date representation on the x-axis (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD,
  MM/DD/YYYY, Month Year)?

  7. Should the chart title emphasize Bitcoin''s price movement or the significant
  fluctuations during bull-run periods?

  8. Do you have any specific font preferences for labels and legends?'
answers: '1. I have no specific color preferences.

  2. For ''significantly higher'' or ''significantly lower,'' let''s use a threshold
  of 10% change between the 24h High/24h Low and 24h Open.

  3. I am not sure about the style or theme.

  4. It should strictly be a scatter plot, no lines connecting the points.

  5. I prefer having both major and minor gridlines for better readability.

  6. I have no specific preference for date format on the x-axis.

  7. The chart title should emphasize both Bitcoin''s price movement and significant
  fluctuations during bull-run periods.

  8. I do not know about any specific font preferences for labels and legends.'
