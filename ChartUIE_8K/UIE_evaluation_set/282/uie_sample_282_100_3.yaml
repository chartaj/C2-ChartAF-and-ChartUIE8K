initial_prompt: 'Create a choropleth map that displays the distribution of celebrity
  net worth across different nationalities. Use the ''Nationality'' and ''Estimated
  Net Worth'' columns from the dataset. Countries should be color-coded based on the
  total net worth of celebrities from each nationality. The darker the shade, the
  higher the total net worth for that country. Make sure to include a legend that
  explains the color coding. Additionally, provide tooltips that show the total estimated
  net worth for each country when you hover over it. Title the map: "Global Distribution
  of Celebrity Net Worth in 2023".'
