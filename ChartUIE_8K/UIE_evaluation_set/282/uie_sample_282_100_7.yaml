initial_prompt: I want a geographic heatmap showcasing the estimated net worth of
  celebrities by nationality at the end of 2023. The heatmap should use intensity
  to indicate higher net worth locations. Include labels or tooltips showing the top
  names, their net worth, and age, with differentiation by gender. Make the chart
  interactive if possible, to allow zooming into specific regions for more detailed
  views.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap intensity?

  2. Would you like any specific font style or size for the labels or tooltips?

  3. How many top names should be displayed in the labels or tooltips for each nationality?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the intensity levels of net worth?

  5. Do you have specific geographic regions you want to emphasize?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds of net worth that you would like to highlight
  or differentiate?

  7. Would you prefer the heatmap to be displayed in a specific map projection (e.g.,
  Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. Should the gender differentiation be represented by different colors, shapes,
  or another visualization method in the tooltips?

  9. Do you have a preference for the type of map to use (e.g., world map, country
  map, regional map)?'
