initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot for the 2023 Celebrity Net Worth data. Each
  dot should represent a different celebrity, using their estimated net worth on the
  x-axis and their age at the end of 2023 on the y-axis. Use different colors to distinguish
  between nationalities and different shapes to represent the gender. This will help
  visualize the distribution of wealth among different age groups and demographics.
  Make sure to label the axes clearly and include a legend. Thank you!

  the plot?

  6. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels and
