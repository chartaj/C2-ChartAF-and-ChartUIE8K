initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that visualizes the estimated net worth
  of celebrities in 2023. The x-axis should display the names of the celebrities,
  while the y-axis should show their estimated net worth in billions of dollars. Additionally,
  use different colors to represent the industries they are associated with. This
  will help in understanding the distribution of wealth among various industry sectors.

  in the chart. Thank you!

  titles?
