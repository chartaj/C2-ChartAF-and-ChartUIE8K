initial_prompt: Create a Sunburst chart visualizing the "2023 Celebrity Net Worth"
  dataset. The chart should categorize celebrities based on "Nationality," then further
  break down into "Industry," followed by "Gender," and finally display individual

  help illustrate the distribution of wealth among celebrities from different nationalities

  interactive elements or labels. The final output should effectively communicate
  how net worth varies across these parameters, making it insightful for users interested
  in wealth distribution and celebrity demographics.
