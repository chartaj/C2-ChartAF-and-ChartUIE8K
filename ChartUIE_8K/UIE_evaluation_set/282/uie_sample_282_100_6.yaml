initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart that visualizes the estimated net worth
  of different celebrities from the 2023 data set. Each bubble should represent a
  celebrity, with the size of the bubble corresponding to their estimated net worth.
  The x-axis should show the age at the end of 2023, and the y-axis should display
  the birth year. Make sure to differentiate the bubbles using colors based on nationality.
  Also, include labels for the name and industry of each celebrity.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color palette for differentiating nationalities?

  2. Would you like the bubbles to be transparent to avoid overlap, and if so, to
  what degree?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels of names
  and industries?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the axis label styles or their locations?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their style?

  6. Would you like tooltips or annotations to appear when hovering over the bubbles?

  7. Do you prefer a specific range for the x-axis (age at end of 2023) and y-axis
  (birth year)?

  8. Should we include a legend explaining the bubble sizes, colors, and other elements?

  9. What level of detail would you like for the labels (e.g., full name vs. first
  name only, abbreviated industry names)?

  10. Is there a preferred layout for the chart, such as spacing between bubbles or
  the overall size of the chart?'
