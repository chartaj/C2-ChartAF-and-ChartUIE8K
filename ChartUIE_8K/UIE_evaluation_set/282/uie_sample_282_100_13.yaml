initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the ages of celebrities at the end
  of 2023. The X-axis should represent age groups (e.g., 20-30, 31-40, etc.), and
  the Y-axis should show the number of celebrities in each age group. This will help
  analyze the age distribution within the dataset. Also, use different colors for
  each nationality to see if there's any trend based on nationality. The title should
  be "Age Distribution of Celebrities in 2023." Ensure the histogram is clear and
  easy to understand.

  labels?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing different
  nationalities?'
