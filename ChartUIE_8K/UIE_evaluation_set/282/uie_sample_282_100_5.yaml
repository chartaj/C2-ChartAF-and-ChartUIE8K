initial_prompt: 'Visualize the estimated net worth of celebrities in 2023 using a
  box plot chart. The y-axis should represent the estimated net worth in dollars,
  and the x-axis should categorize the data by industry. Additionally, create separate
  boxes for each nationality within each industry category. This will help compare
  the distribution of net worth across different nationalities within industries.

  net worths. Ensure the chart is easy to read and includes a legend for the nationalities
  and industries used.
