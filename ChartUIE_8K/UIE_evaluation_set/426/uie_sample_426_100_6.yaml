initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the causes of death for Roman emperors
  in the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Use cause of death rows as categories and emperors'
  names as data points. Highlight the frequency of different causes to show patterns
  across different emperors. Include annotations for missing values and note any significant
  historical details. Integrate birth city, birth province, and killer columns for
  additional insights in adjacent charts. Utilize color gradients to emphasize the
  frequency of assassination across the dataset, making it easier to identify prevalent
  trends over the era specified.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific historical details to be displayed as tooltips or annotations
  on the heatmap?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would prefer for highlighting the frequency
  of assassinations?

  4. How would you like missing values to be represented in the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout and positioning of adjacent charts
  showing birth city, birth province, and killer columns?

  6. Are there particular fonts or styles you would like to use for the chart labels
  and titles?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient and its frequency
  indicators?

  8. Do you want the adjacent charts to be of a specific type (e.g., bar chart, pie
  chart)?

  9. Would you prefer the heatmap to be displayed in any specific orientation (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  10. Should the chronological order of emperors be in any particular sequence (e.g.,
  ascending, descending)?'
