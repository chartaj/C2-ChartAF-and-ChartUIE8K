initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the number of Roman emperors
  by their cause of death. Use the data provided from the file **426.csv**. Label
  the x-axis as "Cause of Death" and the y-axis as "Number of Emperors." Ensure each
  unique cause (e.g., assassination, natural) is represented on the x-axis. The title
  of the chart should be "Roman Emperors by Cause of Death." This will help visualize
  how common each cause was among the Roman emperors in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you like for the histogram?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  3. Should the x-axis categories be displayed in any specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  frequency)?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?
  If so, should they be light or prominent?

  5. Do you want to include a legend, or is it unnecessary given the simplicity of
  the categories?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the histogram bar width?

  7. Do you want additional annotations or markers on the chart for specific causes
  of death?

  8. Are there any specific causes of death that should be highlighted or distinguished
  in a unique way?

  9. Do you need any contextual information or notes included on the chart to provide
  additional insights?'
