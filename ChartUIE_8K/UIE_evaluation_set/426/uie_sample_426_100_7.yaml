initial_prompt: Please create a box chart for "The Emperors of Rome" data showing
  the birth and death years of emperors. Use the "birth" and "death" columns from
  the 426.csv dataset to plot the distribution of these years. Highlight any potential
  outliers in the birth and death data. The x-axis should represent the time period
  (in years), and the y-axis should show the emperors. Use different colors for birth
  and death to distinguish them easily. Provide a title indicating the chart shows
  "Life Span of Roman Emperors."
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for distinguishing birth and
  death years?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for easier reading of the
  data?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each outlier point?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the title and axis labels?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included to indicate the meaning of the colors
  used for birth and death years?

  6. Do you have any specific preference for the range of the x-axis (time period
  in years)?

  7. Should the emperors be listed alphabetically, chronologically, or by another
  order on the y-axis?

  8. Is there any specific format you would like for the date labels on the x-axis?
  For example, YYYY-MM-DD or just the year?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or explanations to be included on the
  chart?

  10. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or overall size of the chart?'
