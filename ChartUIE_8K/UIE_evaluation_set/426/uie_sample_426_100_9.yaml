initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the reigns of Roman emperors. Use
  the 'name' as the x-axis and plot 'reign_start' and 'reign_end' as two separate
  series on the y-axis. Differentiate these series by different markers or colors.
  Add tooltips to display 'name_full', 'dynasty', and 'cause' when hovering over data
  points. This will help understand the duration of reigns and compare them across
  different emperors. Also, categorize points based on the 'dynasty' for better insights.
  Ensure the x-axis labels are rotated for readability due to the large number of
  emperors listed.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preference for the colors used for different\
  \ dynasties?\n2. What specific markers would you prefer for 'reign_start' and 'reign_end'?\n\
  3. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels and\
  \ tooltips?\n4. How would you like to handle cases where an emperor's name is particularly\
  \ long? \n5. Would you prefer any gridlines or background shading on the plot for\
  \ better readability?\n6. Is there a specific order you would like the emperors\
  \ to be listed on the x-axis, such as chronological or alphabetical?"
