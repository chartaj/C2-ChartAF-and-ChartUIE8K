initial_prompt: I want a stacked bar chart comparing the reign lengths of Roman emperors.
  The data includes 'name', 'reign_start', and 'reign_end'. Each bar should represent
  an emperor with sections divided based on cause of death (e.g., 'Assassination'
  vs. 'Natural'). Data should show reign duration and highlight assassinations. Make
  sure to label the axes for clarity.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting different causes of
  death?

  2. Do you have a preferred ordering for the emperors in the chart (e.g., chronological,
  alphabetical)?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of reign lengths?

  4. Would you like to include additional annotations or labels for specific emperors
  or causes of death?

  5. Do you prefer specific fonts or font sizes for the labels and titles?

  6. Should there be a legend to explain the color coding of the causes of death?

  7. Would you like any specific styling for the bars or sections within the bars
  (e.g., borders, shading)?

  8. Are there any specific date formats you prefer for ''reign_start'' and ''reign_end''
  on the axis labels?

  9. Should the chart focus specifically on highlighting assassinations with a unique
  visual marker?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis titles text?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Chronological ordering would be good.

  3. Yes, gridlines would be helpful for comparison.

  4. I do not know.

  6. Yes, there should be a legend to explain the color coding.

  7. I am not sure.

  10. "Reign Lengths of Roman Emperors" for the chart title and "Emperors" for the
  x-axis title and "Reign Length (Years)" for the y-axis title.'
