initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart to visualize the reign duration of Roman Emperors
  from the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Use their full names on the x-axis and the duration
  in years on the y-axis. Highlight the cause of their death with different colors
  and use text annotations to show the reign start and end dates. The chart aims to
  provide historical insights into the lengths and ends of their reigns. Include annotations
  highlighting specific points such as famous assassinations or natural causes, with
  additional notes for context.

  \ death?\n\n2. Do you have a preferred font style for the annotations?\n\n3. Would\
  \ you like to include any specific historical notes in the annotations?\n\n4. Should\
  \ the chart include a title or subtitle? If so, what should it be?\n\n5. Do you\
  \ prefer any particular alignment or rotation for the labels on the x-axis?\n\n\
  6. How detailed do you want the text annotations to be for the reign start and end\
  \ dates? \n\n7. Do you have any preferences for the size or style of the marker\
  \ on the lollipop chart?\n\n8. Is there a particular order you want to use for listing\
  \ the emperors on the x-axis (e.g., chronological order)?\n\n9. Should the chart\
  \ have a legend explaining the colors used for different causes of death?\n\n10.\
  \ Would you prefer the chart to include gridlines or background shading for better\
  \ readability?"
