initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of star
  types based on their Spectral_Class. Each bar should represent a different type
  of star, classified by their Spectral_Class, and the height of the bar should indicate
  the count of stars in that class. Additionally, use different colors for each bar
  to represent unique Spectral Classes. This will help me understand the prevalence
  of each star type within this dataset. Please also label the x-axis as "Spectral
  Class" and the y-axis as "Number of Stars." Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  for the different Spectral Classes?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., alphabetically
  by Spectral_Class, by frequency)?

  3. What should be the title of the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better visualization?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations or data labels (e.g., exact count of stars)
  on the bars?

  7. Should there be any specific margin or padding around the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred orientation for the chart (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  bar chart)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. "Distribution of Star Types by Spectral Class"

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  6. Yes, please include the exact count of stars on the bars.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Vertical bar chart, please.'
