initial_prompt: I would like a box chart that visualizes the distribution of star
  temperatures for different types listed in the dataset. Each box should represent
  the range, median, and quartiles of the temperatures for a particular star type
  (Type 0, Type 1, etc.). The chart should clearly indicate the range and outliers
  for each star type, helping to understand the variation in star temperatures across
  different types. Additionally, highlight how many unique color classifications are
  associated with each star type to see any patterns or anomalies in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used in
  the chart?

  2. How would you prefer the outliers to be indicated on the box chart?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or color of the median line
  in the box chart?

  4. How should the unique color classifications be highlighted or annotated on the
  chart?

  5. Would you like a legend to explain the color classifications, and if so, where
  should it be positioned?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have grid lines, and if so, should they be solid or
  dashed?

  7. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., font size, font style)?

  8. Do you prefer any specific range or scaling for the temperature axis?

  9. Should data points be displayed alongside the box charts, or do you prefer a
  cleaner look without individual data points?

  10. Are there any specific titles or captions you''d like to include on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer the outliers to be indicated with dots.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the style or color of the median line.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, I would like a legend explaining the color classifications, positioned at
  the bottom.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have any specific preference for the temperature axis scaling.

  9. I prefer a cleaner look without individual data points.

  10. No specific titles or captions are needed.'
