initial_prompt: I have stellar data from NASA, focusing on star properties like Temperature,
  Luminosity (L), Radius (R), Apparent Magnitude (A_M), Color, and Spectral Class.
  Please create a scatter plot with Temperature on the x-axis and Luminosity (L) on
  the y-axis. Differentiate points by Color and Spectral Class, and mark star Types
  with varied shapes or colors. This visualization should help categorize stars and
  understand their distribution and clustering by types and other properties. Ensure
  to include a legend for clarity. The plot should be easy to interpret for a quick
  comparative study.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating star types
  and other properties?

  2. How would you like the shapes to be used to mark different star types?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  prefer them to be light or dark?

  5. Do you have preferences for the size of the scatter plot points?

  6. Would you like to include data point labels for each star, and if so, how should
  they be formatted?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio of the chart (e.g., 16:9, 4:3)?

  8. Should the Temperature axis be displayed in a linear or logarithmic scale?

  9. Are there any specific ranges for the axes you want to focus on?

  10. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., right, top,
  left, or bottom)?'
