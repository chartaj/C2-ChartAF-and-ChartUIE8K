initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize star classification data from the
  dataset. The x-axis should represent 'Temperature' and the y-axis should show 'L'.
  Each area in the chart should be shaded based on 'Type' to illustrate different
  star types. Use 'Color' and 'Spectral_Class' to differentiate areas further. Ensure
  to include a legend and labels for clarity. The aim is to understand how luminosity
  changes with temperature across different star types and classifications as provided
  by NASA. Please ensure the chart is intuitive and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for shading different star
  types?

  2. Would you prefer a particular color palette for ''Color'' and ''Spectral_Class''
  differentiation?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for labels and legend text?

  5. What size and type of markers do you prefer for data points, if any?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you want to include any annotations or additional information on the chart?

  8. Should the chart legend be placed in a specific location (top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  9. Are there any specific axis scaling preferences you have (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  10. Do you want any specific range or limits set for the ''Temperature'' or ''L''
  axes?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the color palette, so feel free to choose.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  4. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  5. I am not sure about markers; as it is an area chart, they might not be necessary.

  6. A suitable title could be "Luminosity vs. Temperature for Various Star Types."

  7. I do not know if additional annotations are needed.

  8. The legend could be placed at the top.

  9. A logarithmic scale might work better for these data, but I am not certain.

  10. I do not have any specific range or limits in mind for the axes.
