initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot to visualize the star data, focusing on
  the distribution of 'Temperature', 'L', 'R', and 'A_M' across different 'Type' categories.
  Highlight significant differences in these distributions to aid in the classification
  of star types. Annotate key points to emphasize unique values or outliers, and provide
  comments to contextualize these findings, especially in relation to their 'Color'
  and 'Spectral_Class'. Make the plot visually appealing and informative, aligning
  with the Star Type Classification used by NASA.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing different
  ''Type'' categories?

  2. Would you prefer specific markers or shapes for annotating unique values or outliers?

  3. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the annotations and comments
  on the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and title formatting?

  5. Should the plot background be plain or have a grid for better reference?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend placement or style?

  7. Would you prefer any special font types or sizes for the text annotations and
  comments?'
