initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing star data, showing Temperature on the
  x-axis and Luminosity (L) on the y-axis. Use different colors for each Spectral
  Class and dot size to represent Radius (R). Include text annotations for the highest
  and lowest temperature stars to highlight their values. Additional non-data-driven
  annotations should provide a brief context on star types and spectral classification.
  This will help viewers understand the star diversity and their categorization. Emphasize
  red stars and spectral class M using highlights to make them stand out. This visualization
  aids in understanding star classification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the Spectral
  Classes?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the text annotations of the highest
  and lowest temperature stars?

  3. How would you like the non-data-driven annotations on star types and spectral
  classification to be positioned?

  4. Are there specific highlight colors you would prefer for emphasizing red stars
  and spectral class M?

  5. Would you like a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and their font sizes?

  7. Should there be a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  8. How detailed should the brief context on star types and spectral classification
  be?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the size range of the dots representing
  Radius (R)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer the non-data-driven annotations to be positioned at the bottom
  or the sides of the plot.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, the title could be "Star Classification and Diversity".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, a legend should be included, and it could be positioned on the right side
  of the plot.

  8. The brief context on star types and spectral classification should be moderately
  detailed, giving enough information for a general understanding.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
