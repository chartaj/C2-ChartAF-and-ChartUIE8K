initial_prompt: I'm working on a project related to star classifications from NASA.
  I have a dataset with various attributes like Temperature, Luminosity (L), Radius
  (R), Absolute Magnitude (A_M), Color, Spectral Class, and Type. I'd like to create
  a pie chart that shows the distribution of different spectral classes in the dataset.
  The pie chart should help visualize which spectral classes are most common among
  the stars. Could you create this pie chart for me, reflecting the proportions of
  each spectral class? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to see the percentage values displayed on the pie chart slices?

  3. Should the legend display the spectral classes names or any other specific labels?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  5. Would you like the pie chart to include a description or annotations for each
  spectral class?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences for the chart labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  2. Yes, I would like to see the percentage values displayed on the pie chart slices.

  3. The legend should display the spectral class names.

  4. I am not sure about the title.

  5. I do not know if a description or annotations are needed.

  6. I have no specific font preferences for the chart labels and title.'
