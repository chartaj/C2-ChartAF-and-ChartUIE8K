initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Temperature'
  and 'R' values in the star dataset from NASA. Ensure the x-axis represents 'Temperature'
  and the frequency on the y-axis. Similarly, another histogram with 'R' values and
  their frequency.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. How many bins would you like for the histograms?

  3. Do you prefer grid lines in the background of the histograms?

  4. Would you like to include labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should
  they be?

  5. Do you want any specific title for each histogram?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or not?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to apply to the axes?

  8. Do you have any preference for the size and aspect ratio of the histograms?

  9. Would you like to show any statistical information (mean, median, standard deviation)
  on the histograms?

  10. Should the histograms include data labels or annotations for specific data points?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, label the x-axis as ''Temperature'' and ''R'' respectively. Y-axis should
  be ''Frequency'' for both.

  5. No specific preference for the title.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.
