initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing Temperature vs. Luminosity (L), emphasizing
  the "Red" Color and Spectral_Class "M". Use text annotations for maximum and minimum
  values. Highlight different Star Types with varying colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap beyond emphasizing
  "Red" Color?

  2. How would you like the "Red" Color and Spectral_Class "M" to be visually differentiated
  within the heatmap?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or style of text annotations
  for maximum and minimum values?

  4. Would you like to specify any particular color scheme for highlighting different
  Star Types?

  5. Are there any specific labels or legends you want to include on the heatmap?

  6. Would you prefer grid lines or other delineations to be shown on the heatmap
  for better readability?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the axis scales (e.g., linear or logarithmic)
  for Temperature and Luminosity?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for axis labels and titles?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the "Red" Color and Spectral_Class "M" to have a distinct color
  or marker to make them stand out.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not know.'
