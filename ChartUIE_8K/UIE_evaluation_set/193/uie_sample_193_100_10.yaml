initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of different star
  "Types" from the dataset. Each segment of the donut should represent a unique star
  type, with the size of the segment proportional to the number of stars within that
  type. Additionally, use different colors to differentiate between the star types.
  Label each segment with the type number and percentage of the total. This will help
  in understanding the star classification based on the provided data, making it easier
  to analyze the distribution of various star categories.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different star types?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels on the chart?

  3. Do you want the chart to include a legend to explain the colors used for each
  star type?

  4. Should the chart include a title? If so, what should it be?

  5. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the star types (e.g., based on the
  number of stars or alphabetically)?

  6. Would you like to add any tooltips or hover effects to display additional information
  about each segment?'
