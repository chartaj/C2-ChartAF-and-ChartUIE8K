initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap to visualize correlations between various
  numerical factors influencing loan approval decisions. Use the dataset columns related
  to numbers, such as 'income_annum', 'loan_amount', 'loan_term', 'cibil_score', 'residential_assets_value',
  'commercial_assets_value', 'luxury_assets_value', and 'bank_asset_value'. The heatmap
  should show the correlations between these factors to help in understanding which
  features are strongly linked and how they influence the loan status. It will help
  identify the most significant indicators for loan approvals and rejections.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or gradients for the heatmap?

  2. Should there be specific labels or notations on the heatmap cells?

  3. Do you want to display correlation values within the heatmap cells?

  4. Are there any particular plot titles or axis labels you prefer?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or markers for significant correlations?

  7. Do you want to include a color bar indicating the correlation strength?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds for highlighting strong or weak correlations?

  9. Do you have a preference for the order of the variables on the heatmap (e.g.,
  sorted by correlation strength)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I would like to display correlation values within the heatmap cells.

  4. I prefer a title like "Correlation Heatmap of Loan Approval Factors" and axis
  labels matching the dataset columns.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a color bar indicating the correlation strength.

  8. I am not sure, maybe highlight correlations with values above 0.7 and below -0.7.

  9. I do not know.'
