initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of loan
  statuses (Approved vs. Rejected) from the Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset. This
  chart should help us understand the proportion of loans that got approved compared
  to those that were rejected. Label each slice with the corresponding status and
  percentage. Make sure the chart is clear and easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the slices of the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the slices to be separated (exploded) for emphasis?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and percentages?

  4. How detailed should the labels be (just status vs. status with a percentage)?

  5. Would you like the chart title to be included, and if so, what should it be?

  6. Should there be a legend for the chart, or are labels on the slices sufficient?

  7. Do you want the chart to include any additional annotations or notes?

  8. Is there a preferred order for the slices (e.g., Approved first, then Rejected)?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions or size requirements for the chart?'
