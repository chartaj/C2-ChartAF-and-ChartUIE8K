initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the "loan_amount" data from the Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset.
  Annotate specific data points such as the highest and lowest loan amounts to draw
  attention to these elements. Additionally, highlight the bins that correspond to
  approved and rejected loans differently to emphasize their distribution. This will
  help in visualizing the spread and approval status of loans for business insights.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?\n\
  2. What color would you like to use for the bins representing approved loans?\n\
  3. What color would you like to use for the bins representing rejected loans?\n\
  4. What specific annotations would you prefer for the highest and lowest loan amounts?\
  \ (e.g., labels, arrows)\n5. Do you have a preference for the overall color scheme\
  \ of the chart?\n6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the histogram? If\
  \ so, at what intervals?\n7. Do you want a legend to indicate what the different\
  \ colored bins represent?\n8. Are there any specific font preferences for the annotations\
  \ and labels on the chart?\n9. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the\
  \ histogram? \n10. Where would you like the annotated data points (highest and lowest\
  \ loan amounts) to be positioned?"
