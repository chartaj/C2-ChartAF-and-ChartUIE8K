initial_prompt: I would like to see a line chart that shows the trend over loan terms
  (loan_term) with different loan amounts (loan_amount), income yearly (income_annum),
  and loan status (loan_status) over time. I want to understand how the loan amount
  and income influence the approval or rejection status throughout different loan
  terms. Please plot the loan terms on the x-axis, and have multiple lines representing
  loan amounts, income, and statuses on the y-axis. This will help in visualizing
  trends in loan approvals based on financial metrics over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  data attributes (loan amounts, income, and loan statuses)?

  2. Would you like any specific line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for different
  data attributes?

  3. How would you prefer the loan status to be represented on the chart (e.g., separate
  lines for approved and rejected, color-coded markers)?

  4. Should we include data point markers on the lines? If yes, do you have a preferred
  style or shape for these markers?

  5. Would you like to see grid lines on the chart to make it easier to read values?

  6. Do you prefer any specific labels or titles for the axes and the chart overall?

  7. Would you like to include a legend on the chart? If so, where would you prefer
  it to be positioned (top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or intervals for the axes that you would like to
  be set?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the line styles.

  3. Separate lines for approved and rejected statuses would be helpful.

  4. I am not sure about the data point markers.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines to make it easier to read values.

  6. I do not know about specific labels or titles.

  7. Yes, please include a legend, and position it at the top.

  8. I do not know about specific ranges or intervals for the axes.'
