questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap (e.g., sequential,
  diverging)?

  2. Do you have a preferred color palette for positive and negative correlations?

  3. How would you like to handle missing values, if any are present, in the data?

  4. Would you like to display the actual correlation coefficients on the heatmap
  cells?

  5. Do you have any specific font size or style preferences for labels and annotations
  on the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the correlation values?

  7. Do you have any specific layout preferences such as aspect ratio or size for
  the heatmap?

  8. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the variables on the heatmap (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on correlation strength)?

  9. Any preferences for the axis labels and titles formatting (e.g., rotate, font
  size)?

  10. Would you like to include tooltips or hover effects for additional information
  on each cell value?'
