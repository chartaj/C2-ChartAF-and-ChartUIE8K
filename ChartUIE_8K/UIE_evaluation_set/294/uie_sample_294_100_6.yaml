initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the engagement metrics of Cristiano
  Ronaldo's tweets captured in the CSV data. Focus on retweetCount, replyCount, likeCount,
  quoteCount, and bookmarkCount. Use separate histograms for each metric to highlight
  their distributions. Make sure to label the x-axis with the engagement metrics and
  the y-axis with the frequency of occurrences. This will provide insights into how
  fans interact with Ronaldoâ€™s tweets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. Would you like a specific bin size for the histograms or should it be auto-calculated?

  3. Do you prefer any particular style or font for the axes labels and title?

  4. Should there be any grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  5. Do you want to include any statistical summary (mean, median, standard deviation)
  on the histograms?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the plots?

  7. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the histograms (e.g., retweetCount
  first, then replyCount, etc.)?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or highlights for significant points or
  values on the histograms?'
