initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot using the data provided on Ronaldo''s
  tweets. Plot `likeCount` on the x-axis and `retweetCount` on the y-axis to visualize
  the correlation between likes and retweets. Highlight each tweet with a different
  color and include tooltips showing the `text` and `createdAt` for each point. The
