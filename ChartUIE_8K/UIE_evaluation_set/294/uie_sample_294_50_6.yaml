  replies, likes, quotes, and bookmarks from Ronaldo's tweets. This will highlight
  engagement trends.

  replies, likes, quotes, bookmarks) or combined bars?

  type?

  4. Should the x-axis represent specific numerical ranges for engagement counts or
  pre-determined bins?

  5. Do you prefer any specific labels for the axes, or should we use the default
  engagement metric names?

  6. Should the histogram include a legend to differentiate between different engagement
  metrics?

  7. Would you like to display the exact numerical values of each bin on the bars?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the scale of the axes (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  or observations in the histogram?
