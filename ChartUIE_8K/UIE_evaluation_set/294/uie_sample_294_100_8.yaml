initial_prompt: Could you create a heatmap for me that visualizes Ronaldo's tweet
  engagements over time? I want to see the pattern of retweets, replies, likes, quotes,
  and bookmarks from the provided dataset. The columns to be used are 'createdAt'
  for the x-axis (time), and 'retweetCount', 'replyCount', 'likeCount', 'quoteCount',
  'bookmarkCount' for the y-axis (engagement metrics). The visual should help me easily
  identify which tweets had the highest engagement and any trends over the period
  covered in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What time intervals would you like to use on the x-axis (e.g., hourly, daily,
  monthly)?

  3. Should the heatmap display actual count values, or just color intensities?

  4. Would you like to include any labels or annotations for peak engagement periods?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific trends or patterns you are particularly interested in
  highlighting?

  7. Would you like a legend to explain the color scale used in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, maybe daily intervals?

  3. Just color intensities would be fine.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have any specific trends or patterns in mind.

  7. Yes, I would like a legend to explain the color scale used in the heatmap.'
