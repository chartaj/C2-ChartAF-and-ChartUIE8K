initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing engagement trends for Ronaldo's tweets.
  The x-axis should represent the dates (createdAt), and the y-axis should display
  counts. Plot separate lines for retweetCount, replyCount, likeCount, quoteCount,
  and bookmarkCount to highlight how each metric evolves over time. This will help
  understand which tweets garnered the most interaction and identify patterns like
  spikes in likes or retweets on specific dates. Using the data summary and sample
  provided, we can discern trends in fan engagement metrics efficiently. Make the
  chart readable with distinct colors for each engagement type.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for each engagement type (retweetCount,
  replyCount, likeCount, quoteCount, bookmarkCount)?

  2. Do you prefer any specific date format for the x-axis labels?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the line style (solid, dashed, etc.) or thickness
  for each engagement type?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to identify each engagement type line?

  6. Do you want to highlight specific dates or events on the chart where major spikes
  occur?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like to use for the x-axis,
  y-axis, or the chart itself?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color?

  9. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines to show specific values?

  10. Should the chart display tooltips when hovering over specific data points to
  show detailed values?'
