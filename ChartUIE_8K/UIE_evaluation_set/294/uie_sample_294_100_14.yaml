initial_prompt: Please create a step line chart visualizing the engagement trends
  of Ronaldo's tweets over time. Use columns like createdAt (x-axis) and metrics like
  retweetCount, replyCount, likeCount, quoteCount, and bookmarkCount (y-axis). The
  chart should distinctly illustrate how each metric changes stepwise across individual
  tweet timestamps. This will help understand the pattern of engagement over time
  for Ronaldo's tweets. Label each line clearly and add a legend for easy identification
  of different engagement metrics. Utilize colors to differentiate the step lines
  for each metric.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the step lines representing
  different engagement metrics?

  2. Would you like the X-axis to display dates in a specific format?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reference?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or markers to highlight key points or
  events on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Should the Y-axis be scaled to start from zero, or would you like it to dynamically
  scale based on the data range?

  8. Do you want to include any background color or pattern in the chart?
