initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart to visualize Ronaldo's tweet
  engagements over time. The columns should represent individual tweets, and each
  column should be divided into different sections for retweetCount, replyCount, likeCount,
  quoteCount, and bookmarkCount. Make sure to display the createdAt timestamp on the
  x-axis and include labels for better understanding. The chart should ideally highlight

  or patterns in his social media performance.
