initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing India's exports and imports from 1997
  to July 2022. Highlight the trade balance to show trends over time. Annotate key
  points, especially years with significant changes. Include text annotations for
  the highest and lowest trade values, and provide context with financial year indicators.
  Make the chart visually engaging to clearly depict the economic fluctuations in
  trade. This will help in analyzing the trade performance and policy impact across
  different years.

  8. Are there any specific economic indicators or contextual information that need
  to be highlighted alongside the trade data?'
