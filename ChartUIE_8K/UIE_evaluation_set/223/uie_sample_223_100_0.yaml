initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing India's trade data (1997-July
  2022) based on countries. Use color gradients to represent the total trade volume.
  Include text annotations to highlight top 5 countries by total trade and trade balance.
  Emphasize the countries with significant values using bold borders or contrasting
  colors. The map should clearly depict export, import, total trade, and trade balance.
  Use the Financial Year(start) to differentiate the yearly data trends. This visualization
  will help in understanding India's trade distribution and spotting key trading partners
  over the years.
