initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showcasing the annual trade balance of India with
  different countries from 1997 to 2022. Use gradients to represent trade surplus
  and deficit.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or gradient preference for representing
  trade surplus and deficit?

  2. How would you like the countries to be sorted on the heatmap (e.g., alphabetically,
  by trade volume, by region)?

  3. Do you want any specific labels or annotations on the heatmap to highlight certain
  data points or trends?

  4. Would you prefer a particular range of colors to represent different levels of
  trade balance, such as distinct colors for extreme surplus and extreme deficit?

  5. Should we include a legend or key to explain the gradients and values represented
  in the heatmap?

  6. Do you need gridlines or separators between the years and countries for better
  readability?

  7. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the heatmap for context?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the text and labels
  on the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap include interactive elements like tooltips that display exact
  values when hovered over, or do you prefer static values displayed directly on the
  heatmap?'
