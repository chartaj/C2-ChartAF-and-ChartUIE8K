initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the distribution and status of
  languages spoken in New York City. The x-axis should represent the "Country," and
  the y-axis should denote the "Language Family." The size of the bubbles should correlate
  with "Global Speakers," and different colors should signify the "Status" of the
  languages (e.g., Residential, Historical). For missing "Global Speakers" data, use
  a default small size. Include a legend to differentiate the bubble colors based
  on "Status." Exclude languages with missing "Country" data. This chart will help
  understand the linguistic diversity and living situations of various languages in
  NYC.

  language statuses?

  7. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like for the chart labels
  and legend?'
