initial_prompt: I want a stacked column chart that shows the number of languages spoken
  in different world regions of New York City. For each region, stack the columns
  by the Language Families present in that region. Use "World Region" for the x-axis
  and the count of "Language Family" for the y-axis. Each stack segment should represent
  a different language family. Make sure the chart is labeled with the total number
  of languages spoken in each region. This will help visualize the diversity of languages
  and their families across different regions in NYC.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should each language family be represented by a specific color?

  3. Do you want the chart to display data labels for each stack segment?

  4. How would you like the total number of languages spoken in each region to be
  displayed?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the chart labels and titles?

  6. Would you like a legend to identify the language families in the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the x-axis and y-axis to have grid lines?

  8. Should the y-axis be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  9. Do you want any specific title for the chart?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  chart?'
