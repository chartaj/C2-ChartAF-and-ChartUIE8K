initial_prompt: 'Create a Treemap showcasing the languages spoken in New York City,
  segmented by "World Region". Each tile should represent a language, with size indicating
  "Global Speakers" and color denoting "Status" (e.g., Residential, Historical). Highlight
  tiles with missing values in "Global Speakers" differently. Annotate notable languages
  such as Abaza and Abruzzese, showing their "Country" and "Location". Purpose: To
  visualize the diversity and status of languages in NYC, providing insights into
  cultural demographics and residential distribution.'
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for denoting different \"Status\" categories\
  \ (e.g., Residential, Historical)?\n2. How would you like the tiles with missing\
  \ \"Global Speakers\" values to be highlighted (e.g., specific color, pattern)?\n\
  3. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the annotation of notable\
  \ languages such as Abaza and Abruzzese?\n4. Is there a particular layout preference\
  \ for the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?\n5. Are there any specific\
  \ colors or patterns you would like to avoid?\n6. Do you prefer a specific background\
  \ color or texture for the treemap? \n7. Should the \"World Region\" segments be\
  \ visually distinct from each other, and if so, how (e.g., borders, shades)?\n8.\
  \ Would you like to include a legend or key to explain colors and patterns used\
  \ in the treemap?\n9. Do you have a preferred width to height ratio or size for\
  \ the treemap?\n10. Should the annotations for notable languages stand out in a\
  \ specific way (e.g., bold, italic, colored text)?"
