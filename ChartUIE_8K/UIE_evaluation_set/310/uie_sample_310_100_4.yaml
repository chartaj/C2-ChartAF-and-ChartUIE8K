initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the number of Global Speakers against
  the Size of the languages. The x-axis should represent the 'Size' categories (e.g.,
  Smallest, Small, Medium, Large, Largest), and the y-axis should show the 'Global
  Speakers' count. Each language should be a separate line on the chart, with its
  respective data points connected. Ensure to handle the missing values appropriately,
  possibly through interpolation or noting gaps in the line. Title the chart "Global
  Speakers by Language Size" and include legends for clarity.

  languages?

  6. What font style and size would you prefer for the chart title and legends?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart background for better readability?

  8. Should the legends be placed in a specific location on the chart? (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)

  9. Are there any specific languages or size categories that you want to emphasize?

  10. Do you have a preference for the chart''s overall aspect ratio or dimensions
  (e.g., width and height)?'
