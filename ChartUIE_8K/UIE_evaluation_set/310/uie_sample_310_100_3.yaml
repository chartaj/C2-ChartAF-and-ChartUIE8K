initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap that visualizes the number of languages spoken
  in different world regions within New York City. Use the 'World Region' and 'Country'
  columns to categorize the languages, and the 'Global Speakers' column to indicate
  the intensity of language use. The heatmap should highlight regions and countries
  with the highest number of speakers. This will help understand linguistic diversity
  in various parts of NYC. Make sure to handle missing values appropriately to ensure
  accurate representation. The primary focus should be on the geographical spread
  and magnitude of language speakers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like us to handle missing values: Imputation, removal, or another
  method?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color gradient to indicate the intensity of language
  use?

  4. Should the heatmap include annotations for values within the cells?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color intensity?

  6. Should the heatmap display grid lines to separate each category visibly?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to see on the axes?

  8. Do you prefer the countries to be clustered by world region in the heatmap?

  9. Should the size of the cells in the heatmap be adjusted based on the number of
  speakers?'
