initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart to visualize the CpG values of smoking
  and non-smoking patients. Use the following columns: ''Smoking Status'' for categorization
  and ''cg00050873'', ''cg00212031'', ''cg00213748'' among others for the CpG values.
  The chart should clearly show the distribution of CpG values for each smoking status
  category. Highlight key differences between smoking categories and optionally annotate
  outliers. The purpose of this chart is to analyze variations in CpG methylation
  based on smoking status, aiding in biological research.'
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the box chart, especially for
  differentiating between smoking and non-smoking categories?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the layout or orientation of the boxes
  (vertical or horizontal)?

  3. Would you like the chart to include grid lines or background shading for better
  readability?

  4. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text and labels in the
  chart?

  6. Should the chart include legends, and if so, where would you prefer them to be
  positioned (top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. How would you like the outliers to be annotated or highlighted (different color,
  specific marker, etc.)?

  8. Is there a specific range or scale you want to set for the y-axis (CpG values)?

  9. Do you prefer any specific size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  10. Would you like to display the mean or median values within each box plot?

  11. Should the chart include axis labels, and if so, how would you like them to
  be formatted?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Vertical is fine.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. "CpG Methylation Levels by Smoking Status"

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include the legend on the right.

  7. Different color for outliers.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Display the median values.

  11. Yes, label as "CpG Sites" for the x-axis and "Methylation Value" for the y-axis.'
