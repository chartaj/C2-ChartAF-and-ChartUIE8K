initial_prompt: Create a histogram to compare the distribution of 'Age' among the
  patients categorized by their 'Smoking Status.' Use the 'Age' column for the x-axis,
  and the frequency of each age group for the y-axis. Separate the data into 'current'
  and 'non-smoking' groups using the 'Smoking Status' column to show the differences
  in age distribution. This will allow us to visualize any potential age-related trends
  or differences between smokers and non-smokers. Make sure to title the chart appropriately
  and label the axes for clear interpretation. Also, use different colors for each
  group for better distinction.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  2. What color preferences do you have for distinguishing ''current'' smokers from
  ''non-smoking'' patients?

  3. Would you like to specify any particular bin width for the age groups on the
  x-axis?

  4. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  5. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the histogram? If so, do you have a preference
  for their color or style?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to clearly indicate which color corresponds to
  each ''Smoking Status'' group? If yes, where should the legend be positioned?'
