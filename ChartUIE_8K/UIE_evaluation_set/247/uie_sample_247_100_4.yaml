initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that shows the average CpG values for each smoking
  status ("current" and "non-smoker"). Use the columns "Smoking Status" and CpG columns
  (from "cg00050873" to "cg03706273"). For each smoking status, average the CpG values
  for the respective category. This will help visualize how smoking status affects
  these CpG values. Please ensure the bars are color-coded by smoking status, and
  include error bars to show the variability (standard deviation) within each group.
  Title the chart "Average CpG Values by Smoking Status".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the smoking status (e.g.,
  specific colors for ''current'' and ''non-smoker'')?

  2. What level of granularity do you want for the error bars (e.g., standard deviation
  or standard error)?

  3. Do you want the CpG values displayed on the Y-axis to be in raw form or any specific
  transformation (e.g., log scale)?

  4. Would you prefer any specific axis labels or font size for better readability?

  5. Is there any particular order you would like the bars to be in (e.g., ''current''
  first, ''non-smoker'' second) or grouped in a specific way?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you have in mind for the chart?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or labels on the chart to highlight
  specific data points?

  8. Is there a preference for the style of the error bars (e.g., capped, uncapped,
  dashed)?

  9. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the title and axis labels?

  10. Are there any other specific elements you would like to include in the chart,
  such as a legend positioning or background gridlines?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Standard deviation would be great.

  3. Raw form is fine.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. ''Current'' first, ''non-smoker'' second.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Capped error bars would be nice.

  9. I don''t have a preference.

  10. A legend positioning would be helpful.'
