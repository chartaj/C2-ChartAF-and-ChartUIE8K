initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the CpG values of smoking and non-smoking
  patients from the given data. Annotate specific data points to highlight the differences
  between the smoking statuses and genders. Use different colors or markers to distinguish
  between 'current', 'former', and 'non-smokers'. Highlight data points for 'current'
  smokers to make them stand out. Display the ages along the x-axis and the CpG values
  along the y-axis. This will help to understand the impact of smoking on CpG values.
  Title the chart appropriately to reflect the study of smoking effects on patients.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different smoking
  statuses?
