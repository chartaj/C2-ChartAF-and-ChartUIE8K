initial_prompt: I have some data about different countries that includes their continent,
  life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita. It looks like this data is meant
  to help analyze global economic and social conditions. Could you create a column
  chart for me that compares the GDP per capita and life expectancy for these countries?
  I'd like to see how countries from different continents fare in terms of these two
  aspects. Make sure to clearly indicate the countries and their respective continents
  on the chart. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for how the countries should be labeled on
  the chart (e.g., country names, ISO codes)?

  2. Would you like the continents to be color-coded for easier differentiation?

  3. Should the chart include error bars or confidence intervals for life expectancy
  and GDP per capita?

  4. Do you want a legend indicating the continents on the chart?

  5. How would you prefer the data to be grouped: by continent or presented in a mixed
  manner?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the chart title or axis labels?

  7. Should the values be shown on the bars for better readability?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart to help with value estimation?

  9. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the column chart (vertical or
  horizontal)?

  10. Would you like to include data source information and timestamp on the chart
  for credibility?

  11. Are there any specific colors or themes you prefer for the chart?'
