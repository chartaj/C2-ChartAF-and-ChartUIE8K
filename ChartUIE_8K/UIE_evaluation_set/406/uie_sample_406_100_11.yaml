initial_prompt: I have a dataset that includes information about different countries,
  their continents, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita. I would like
  a scatter plot with GDP per capita on the x-axis and life expectancy on the y-axis,
  with each point representing a country. Different continents should be represented
  with different colors. This will help visualize the correlation between a country's
  wealth and the average lifespan of its citizens. Make sure to label the axes and
  include a legend for the continents.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?\n2. Do you have\
  \ any color preferences for the continents?\n3. Would you like to include data labels\
  \ for each country on the scatter plot?\n4. What specific font style and size would\
  \ you prefer for the axis labels and title?\n5. Should the axes have grid lines\
  \ to improve readability?\n6. Do you prefer a specific range for the x-axis (GDP\
  \ per capita) and y-axis (life expectancy)?\n7. Would you like to highlight any\
  \ specific countries or continents on the chart?\n8. Do you want to include any\
  \ annotations or text boxes to emphasize particular points or trends in the data?\n\
  9. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)\
  \ on the chart? \n10. Are there any specific chart elements or styles you particularly\
  \ dislike and prefer to avoid?"
