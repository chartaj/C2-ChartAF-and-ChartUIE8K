initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualization of life expectancy, population,
  and GDP per capita for different countries across continents. Iâ€™d like the chart
  highlighted to emphasize the differences between continents. Ensure annotations
  are used to display the values of life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita
  for at least some countries to draw attention to their data points. Keep in mind
  that this data comes from the social science domain, focusing on comparing GDP and
  life expectancy across various regions. This helps to identify trends and socioeconomic
  disparities among the countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Should specific continents be highlighted in certain colors?

  3. How many countries'' data points do you want annotated for life expectancy, population,
  and GDP per capita?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the annotations and labels?

  5. Should the box plot display outliers explicitly or should they be omitted?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate continents?

  7. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical box plots?

  8. Should the axes be standardized or allow for variable scaling based on the data?

  9. Would you like to include gridlines to improve readability?

  10. Do you have a preference for the order of the continents displayed on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. At least 5 countries'' data points should be annotated.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Outliers should be displayed explicitly.

  6. Yes, a legend to differentiate continents should be included.

  7. I prefer vertical box plots.

  8. Axes should allow for variable scaling based on the data.

  9. Yes, include gridlines to improve readability.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
