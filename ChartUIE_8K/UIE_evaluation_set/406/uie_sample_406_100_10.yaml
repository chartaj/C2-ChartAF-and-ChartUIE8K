initial_prompt: I'd like a Choropleth map that depicts the GDP per capita of different
  countries around the world. The map should use varying shades of color to represent
  the GDP per capita, making it easy to compare economic conditions between countries.
  Additionally, I want the life expectancy to be indicated as a secondary metric,
  perhaps as a tooltip when you hover over each country. The map should visually differentiate
  the continents, such as Asia, Europe, and Africa, to provide a clear global perspective.
  This will help in a social-science context to analyze the correlation between GDP
  and life expectancy.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for representing GDP
  per capita on the map?

  2. How many different shades would you like the color scale to have for GDP per
  capita?

  3. Do you want to include a legend for the GDP per capita color scale? If yes, where
  should it be positioned?

  4. How would you prefer the continents to be visually differentiated? (e.g., borders,
  background colors)

  5. Would you like the names of the countries to be displayed directly on the map?

  6. Do you prefer a specific format for the tooltip displaying life expectancy? If
  yes, please specify.

  7. Should the map include any additional demographic or geographical data, such
  as population or area size?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the map''s projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  9. Is there a specific title or labels you would like to include on the map?'
