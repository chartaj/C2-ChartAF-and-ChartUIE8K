initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot to visualize the GDP per capita versus life
  expectancy for different countries based on the provided data. Each dot should represent
  a country, with the x-axis showing the GDP per capita and the y-axis showing the
  life expectancy. Use different colors to distinguish between continents. Label the
  axes clearly and include a legend to identify the continents. This will help in
  analyzing the relationship between a country's economic performance and the life
  expectancy of its population. Use the sample data and ensure the plot is informative
  and visually appealing.
