initial_prompt: 'Please create a grouped bar chart that compares life expectancy and
  GDP per capita across different countries and continents. Use the dataset showing
  countries, continents, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita. Make sure
  the x-axis represents the countries grouped by continents, while the y-axis shows
  the values for life expectancy and GDP per capita. Each group should display two
  bars: one for life expectancy and another for GDP per capita. This will help visualize
  the relationship between economic prosperity and life expectancy in different regions.
  Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing life
  expectancy and GDP per capita?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show exact values?

  3. How would you like the continents grouped on the x-axis â€“ by alphabetical order
  or by another criterion?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between life expectancy and
  GDP per capita bars?

  5. Do you want any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Is there a particular title you would like for the chart?

  7. Would you prefer a particular size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  11. Are there any benchmarks or reference lines you would like to include for life
  expectancy or GDP per capita?

  12. How detailed do you want the tick marks on the y-axis to be?'
