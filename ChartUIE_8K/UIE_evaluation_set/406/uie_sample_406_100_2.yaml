  Create a stacked bar chart comparing life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita
  across different continents. Highlight notable differences between continents using
  colors or other visual modifications. Ensure the annotations focus on key insights
  such as the highest and lowest values, as well as interesting patterns. The purpose
  is to provide a clear visual comparison for understanding the relationship between
  these variables across various continents. Include annotations for data points that
  stand out, such as countries with extreme values. This will help emphasize important
  data insights for a social science analysis.
