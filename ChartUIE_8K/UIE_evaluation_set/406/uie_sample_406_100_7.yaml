initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the GDP per capita of different countries,
  grouped by continent. Data should be sourced from the provided csv file. Each bar
  should represent a different country, categorized into their respective continents.
  Include a title "GDP Per Capita by Country and Continent" and label the axes appropriately.
  Additionally, use different colors for each continent to clearly distinguish the
  groups. Ensure the y-axis represents GDP per capita and the x-axis lists the countries.
  This will help in understanding the economic performance across various regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for representing different
  continents?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  3. How would you like the bar groups (continents) to be ordered? Alphabetically
  or by another criterion?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart? If so, should they be major,
  minor, or both?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  rotated, vertical)?

  6. Do you want data labels (e.g., GDP per capita value) to be displayed on the bars?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or highlights for particular countries
  or continents?

  8. Is there a specific format or style for the legend that you''d prefer?

  9. Should there be any specific margins or padding around the chart?

  10. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?'
