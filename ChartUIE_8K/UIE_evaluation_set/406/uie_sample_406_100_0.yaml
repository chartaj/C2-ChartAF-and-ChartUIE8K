initial_prompt: Create a line chart comparing life expectancy and GDP per capita across
  different countries and continents. Highlight the countries with the highest and
  lowest life expectancy and GDP per capita using different colors. Include text annotations
  for these highlighted countries to emphasize their values. The purpose of this visualization
  is to observe trends and disparities in economic status and health outcomes globally.
  The chart should help identify which regions lag or excel in these metrics, providing
  insights into social-science-related inquiries. Use a distinct line style for each
  continent for better differentiation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the countries
  with the highest and lowest life expectancy and GDP per capita?

  2. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preference for the line styles to differentiate each continent
  (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Would you like a legend to explain the line styles and colors used in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific type of axis scaling (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for
  GDP per capita or life expectancy?

  6. Are there any specific countries or continents that you would like to focus on
  or prefer to be more prominent in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for easier reference? If so,
  do you prefer major gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  8. Is there a particular chart title or subtitle you would like to include to provide
  context to the viewers?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the positioning of the text annotations (e.g.,
  top, bottom, right, left of the data point)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional context or notes below the chart?'
