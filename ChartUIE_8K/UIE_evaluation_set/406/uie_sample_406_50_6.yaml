initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the GDP per capita distribution
  across different continents, highlighting the variation in GDP levels. Consider
  using data that includes countries, their respective continents, life expectancy,
  population, and GDP per capita. This will help in showcasing economic disparities
  within continents.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette of the violin
  plot?

  2. Should the plot include markers for the median or mean GDP per capita within
  each continent?

  3. Would you like to see individual data points overlaid on the violin plot?

  4. Are there any specific continents you would like to highlight or annotate?

  5. Do you prefer any custom styling or themes (e.g., minimalist, corporate, vibrant)?

  6. Should the axes and grid lines be clearly visible or more subdued?

  7. Do you require specific labels or titles for the axes, plot title, or any subtitles?

  8. Would you like to include a legend for the continents if the colors are used
  to differentiate them?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the axes (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  10. Should the chart include any contextual information or callouts to emphasize
  particular findings?'
