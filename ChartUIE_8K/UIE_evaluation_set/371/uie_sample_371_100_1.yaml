initial_prompt: Create a table chart that visualizes the "words" dataset. The table
  should display columns for "Text" and "Category". Use text annotations to highlight
  specific word categories such as "Subject". Additionally, use highlights to differentiate
  the categories visually by changing the text color or background color of the cells.
  This will help in emphasizing the intended linguistic study on how frequently different
  types of words appear. The table serves to provide clear, categorized views of the
  sample data for literature and linguistics analysis, aiding in both educational
  and research purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific text colors used to highlight
  different word categories?

  2. Would you like the background color of the cells to vary by category, and if
  so, do you have specific color preferences?

  3. Are there particular fonts or text sizes you would prefer for the table chart?

  4. How would you like the text annotations for ''Subject'' to appear (e.g., bold,
  italic, different font size)?

  5. Should the table be sorted in any specific order, such as alphabetically by ''Text''
  or grouped by ''Category''?'
