initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different word
  categories from a given data set, specifically focusing on the categories of "Subject".
  Use text annotations to highlight key points in the chart where the frequency peaks.
  This will help compare the incidence of different words categorized as subjects,
  and also visually divide and emphasize the importance of some elements over others.
  Additionally, make use of color highlights to make these elements stand out, ensuring
  a clear focus on particular data points for easy analysis and better interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for highlighting
  different elements?

  2. Would you like the bar chart to display the frequency values explicitly on each
  bar?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations?

  4. How would you prefer the bars to be sorted (e.g., ascending, descending, by alphabetical
  order)?

  5. Is there a specific range or limit you want to set for the y-axis?

  6. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability of frequency levels?

  7. Are there any particular categories or words you want to emphasize more than
  others using different colors or annotations?

  8. Do you have a preferred position for the legend on the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  10. Is there a preference for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, corporate)?'
