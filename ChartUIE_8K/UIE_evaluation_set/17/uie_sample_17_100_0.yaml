initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of average ratings
  for books from different publishers. Use the provided book data, highlighting the
  top-rated books. Add shapes to emphasize clustering of ratings for top publishers
  like 'Scholastic Inc.' and outliers. The chart should help identify patterns in

  readable and visually appealing.
