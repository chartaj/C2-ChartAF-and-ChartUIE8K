initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart visualizing the trends in average ratings and
  ratings count of Harry Potter books over time. Use the publication date for the
  x-axis and have two y-axes: one for average ratings and another for ratings count.
  Highlight specific data points for each book in the series from the dataset. Ensure
  the chart clearly distinguishes the ratings trends and counts for better comparison.
  Also, include data on text reviews count for additional context. Make it interactive
  to zoom in on specific years.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  average ratings and ratings count?

  2. Would you like to use a specific style for highlighting the data points of each
  book in the series (e.g., different shapes, colors, or annotations)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the range of the y-axes (e.g., starting at zero
  or tailored to the data range)?

  4. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include for the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines or background shading to help distinguish
  between the y-axes values?

  8. Are there any specific years or periods you would like to emphasize on the x-axis?

  9. What kind of tooltips or data labels would you like to be displayed when hovering
  over the data points?'
