initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize book data from Goodreads.
  Specifically, I want to see the distribution of average ratings across different
  authors. The chart should have authors on the x-axis and their books' average ratings
  on the y-axis. Use different colors for each rating category to highlight differences.
  Include annotations to emphasize authors with the highest and lowest average ratings.
  The visualization should help in quickly identifying which authors have the most
  consistently high-rated books. This will be used for a study in arts and entertainment.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the rating categories?

  2. What categories or ranges should be used for the average ratings?

  3. How would you like the authors to be sorted on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by average rating, etc.)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the annotation style for highlighting authors with
  the highest and lowest average ratings?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  6. Do you want to include a legend for the rating categories, and if so, where should
  it be positioned?

  7. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle, and if so, what should they
  be?

  8. Is there any additional text or notes you would like to include on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. By average rating.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be positioned.

  7. Yes, include a title and subtitle. Title: "Distribution of Average Ratings Across
  Authors from Goodreads", Subtitle: "Highlighting Authors with the Most Consistently
  High-Rated Books".

  8. No additional text or notes are needed.'
