initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the "venda" data from the dataset,
  representing the distribution of sales over time. Ensure the histogram highlights
  key ranges with a different color to emphasize high and low sales periods. Annotate
  notable peaks to display their values clearly. The purpose of this visualization
  is to aid in retail sales forecasting, helping identify sales trends and inventory
  needs over specified periods. Ensure any missing value adjustments are noted and
  manage axes to be clear and readable. This will help us make more informed business
  decisions.
questions: '1. What color preferences do you have for highlighting key ranges in the
  histogram?

  2. How would you like the notable peaks to be annotated? (e.g., specific formatting,
  labeling, etc.)

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for bin sizes in the histogram?

  4. Are there any specific date ranges or periods you want to emphasize in the visualization?

  5. Do you have any preferred styles or themes for the histogram chart?

  6. Is there a specific font or size you prefer for the axis labels and annotations?

  7. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the histogram? If so, what
  should they be?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the colors; please choose what
  looks best.

  2. I would like the notable peaks to be annotated with the sales value clearly displayed
  above the peak.
