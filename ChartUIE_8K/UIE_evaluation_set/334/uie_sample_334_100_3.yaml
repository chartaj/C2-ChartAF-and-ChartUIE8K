initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the retail sales forecasting data.
  The x-axis should have the 'data' column representing different dates, and the bars
  should represent 'venda' (sales) values for each date. Color-code the bars to represent
  different days to make it visually distinct. The y-axis should depict the 'venda'
  values. Ensure the chart title reflects "Retail Sales over Time" and include labels
  for both axes. I want to clearly see the sales trends over time from this bar chart
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific colors to be used for different
  days in the color-coded bars?

  2. Would you like the dates on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific format (e.g.,
  ''YYYY-MM-DD'', ''DD-MM-YYYY'')?

  3. Should the bars be of a particular width or spacing?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for easier readability? If so, should they
  be on both axes or just one?

  5. Is there a specific font preference or size for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the colors to be used.

  2. I am not sure about the format for the dates on the x-axis.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the width or spacing of the bars.

  4. I am not sure about grid lines; I don''t have a preference.

  5. I do not know about the font preference or size for the labels and title.'
