initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing sales data with columns for date, sales
  volume, inventory level, and price. I want to visualize this information using a
  line chart to track trends over time. The x-axis should represent the dates, and
  the y-axis should depict sales volume, inventory level, and price on the same chart
  with different colored lines. This will help in forecasting and understanding the
  relationship between sales, inventory, and pricing over time. The intention is to
  detect patterns, seasonal trends, or any anomalies in the retail sales data. The
  visualization should be clear and easy to interpret.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred colors for the lines representing sales volume,\
  \ inventory level, and price? \n2. Would you like to include a legend to identify\
  \ each line, and if so, where should it be positioned?\n3. Should the x-axis (dates)\
  \ be labeled with every data point, or would you like to include periodic labels\
  \ (e.g., monthly, quarterly)?\n4. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for easier\
  \ tracing and comparison, and if so, should they be on both the x-axis and y-axis?\n\
  5. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for significant dates or\
  \ events?\n6. What style of line do you prefer (e.g., solid, dashed, or dotted)?\
  \ \n7. Are there any specific date ranges you want to zoom in on or highlight? \n\
  8. Do you need the ability to toggle the visibility of each line (sales volume,\
  \ inventory level, price)?\n9. Would you like to display the data points on the\
  \ lines (e.g., dots or markers at each data point)?"
