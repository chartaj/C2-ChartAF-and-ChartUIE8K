initial_prompt: 'Create a distribution plot visualizing ''signal1'' and ''signal2''
  over time. Highlight significant peaks. Include annotations for patterns or anomalies.
  Purpose: To analyze signal consistency and identify any critical deviations over
  the 3000 unique time points.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the significant
  peaks?

  2. Would you like the plot to include grid lines or remain clean?

  3. Should the time axis use a linear scale or a logarithmic scale?

  4. Do you prefer a specific type of line or marker style for the signals?

  5. How would you like the annotations for patterns or anomalies to be displayed?
  (e.g., text boxes, arrows)

  6. Should there be separate plots for each signal, or should both signals be overlaid
  on the same plot?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between ''signal1'' and ''signal2''?

  8. Are there specific thresholds or criteria for highlighting significant peaks
  and anomalies?

  9. Would you prefer any specific labels or titles for the axes and plot?

  10. Should the plot include a moving average or trend line for better visualization
  of signal consistency?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Linear scale.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Text boxes and arrows.

  6. Both signals should be overlaid on the same plot.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
