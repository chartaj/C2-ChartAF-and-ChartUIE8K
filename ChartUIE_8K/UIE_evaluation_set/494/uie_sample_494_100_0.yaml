initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the given dataset. The x-axis should
  represent "time," while the y-axis should display "signal1" and "signal2" on the
  same plot but distinguished by different colors and markers. Highlight the points
  where "signal1" exceeds 1.5 with larger, bolder markers to emphasize them. Additionally,
  include trend lines for both "signal1" and "signal2" to visualize their overall
  trends. Use shape annotations, such as arrows, to pinpoint significant peaks and
  troughs in the signals. The purpose is to analyze the time-series data and identify
  key moments in signal behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for distinguishing "signal1"
  and "signal2"?

  2. Are there preferred markers you would like for "signal1" and "signal2" data points?

  3. What color and size do you prefer for the larger, bolder markers for "signal1"
  points that exceed 1.5?

  4. Do you have any particular style preferences for the trend lines (e.g., dashed,
  solid)?

  5. Are there specific colors or styles you would like for the trend lines of "signal1"
  and "signal2"?

  6. What shape annotations (e.g., arrows) and colors do you prefer for pinpointing
  significant peaks and troughs in the signals?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or gridline style?

  8. Are there any specific title or axis label fonts and sizes you would prefer for
  the chart?'
