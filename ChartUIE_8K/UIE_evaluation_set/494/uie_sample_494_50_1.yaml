  6. Would you like to include gridlines or a background color to enhance visualization?

  7. Should any annotations or labels be added to highlight important points on the
  chart?

  8. Do you want a legend to differentiate between signal1 and signal2, and if so,
  where should it be positioned?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart titles and labels?

  10. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the chart? If yes, please provide
  the text.'
