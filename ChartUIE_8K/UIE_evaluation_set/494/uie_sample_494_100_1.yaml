questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the extreme values
  in the dataset?

  2. Would you like specific shapes such as arrows, rectangles, or lines to be used
  for highlighting extreme values? If yes, please specify.

  3. Should the chart include a legend to explain the highlights and shapes used?

  4. Do you prefer a specific type of chart (e.g., line chart, bar chart) for visualizing
  the data?

  5. Should we include labels on the axis to clearly identify the time and signal
  values?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines to make it easier to read the data points?
