initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize tax rate changes over years for different
  filing statuses. Annotate key changes using text annotations for clarity and highlight
  significant rate jumps. This visualization helps understand historical tax trends
  for better financial planning.
questions: "1. What color palette do you prefer for different filing statuses in the\
  \ line chart?\n2. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed)\
  \ for each filing status?\n3. How would you like the significant rate jumps to be\
  \ highlighted (e.g., color change, marker)? \n4. Are there specific years or tax\
  \ rates you want to be annotated with text?\n5. Do you need a legend to differentiate\
  \ between the different filing statuses, or should it be directly labeled on the\
  \ lines?\n6. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations and\
  \ labels?\n7. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout of the X and Y\
  \ axes, such as gridlines or tick marks?\n8. Would you prefer the chart to include\
  \ a title and subtitle? If yes, what should they be?\n9. Should the chart include\
  \ any specific notes or references (e.g., legislative changes) in a designated area?\n\
  10. How would you like the data points to be marked, if at all (e.g., circles, squares)?"
