initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing different tax rates and brackets across
  various filing statuses for the year 2021. One bar group should represent each filing
  status (Married Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Single Filer, Head of
  Household), and within each group, display bars for each tax rate (10%, 12%, 22%).
  Each bar height should represent the corresponding income threshold for that tax
  rate in dollars. Ensure labels and legends differentiate rates and filing statuses.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  tax rates?

  2. Should the chart have grid lines for better readability, or do you prefer a cleaner
  look without them?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on top of each bar to show the exact income
  thresholds?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Should the legend be placed at a specific position (e.g., top, right, bottom)
  or follow a default placement?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  7. Would you like to include additional annotations or notes on the chart, such
  as a note about the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the filing statuses to be displayed
  (e.g., Married Filing Jointly first, then Married Filing Separately, etc.)?

  9. Would you like to specify a particular chart size or aspect ratio to suit the
  medium where it will be displayed?'
