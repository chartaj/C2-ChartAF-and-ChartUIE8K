initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of Sales across
  different Ship Modes from the Superstore sales dataset. Highlight the median Sales
  for each Ship Mode using distinct colors for better comparison. Add text annotations
  to show the maximum Sales value within each category to draw attention to outliers.
