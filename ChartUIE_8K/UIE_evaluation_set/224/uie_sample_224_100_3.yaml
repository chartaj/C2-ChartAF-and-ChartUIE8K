initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation of sales between different
  states in the Superstore Sales Dataset. The x-axis should represent the various
  product categories (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology), and the y-axis should
  represent the states. Use color intensity to indicate the magnitude of sales, with
  darker colors representing higher sales. Include a color legend to differentiate
  the sales values. Make sure missing data points are handled appropriately. The visualization
  should help identify which product categories perform best in which states. This
  will assist in strategic decision-making for regional sales planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display the exact sales values on the heatmap or prefer it
  to be just color intensity-based?

  3. How would you like to handle missing data points in the heatmap?

  4. Do you have a specific ordering preference for states and categories in the heatmap?

  5. What title would you like for the heatmap to clearly convey its purpose?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed for better readability, or should they
  be omitted for a cleaner look?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to be included in
  the heatmap?'
