initial_prompt: I need a Choropleth map visualizing the Superstore Sales Dataset.
  The map should depict sales distribution across different states in the United States.
  Use color gradients to represent the magnitude of sales, with darker colors indicating
  higher sales and lighter colors indicating lower sales. Make sure to label each
  state with its name and include a legend to explain the color scale. Include hover-over
  tooltips that show the exact sales figures for each state. This will help in analyzing
  regional sales performance effectively. Ensure the map is interactive for more detailed
  exploration of the sales data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradient?

  2. Are there specific states you want to highlight or focus on?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the styling of the state labels?

  4. Would you like the legend to be displayed in a particular position on the map?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include on
  the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette, but a gradient from light blue
  to dark blue sounds good.

  2. I do not have any specific states to highlight or focus on.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure about the position of the legend, please use your best judgment.

  5. I do not have any additional annotations or markers to include.'
