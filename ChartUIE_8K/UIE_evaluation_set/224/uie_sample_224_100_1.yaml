initial_prompt: I want a box chart visualizing the distribution of sales across different
  product categories. Highlight the median sales for each category to emphasize central
  tendencies. Use text annotations to show specific sales values for some outliers
  in each category. This will help in quickly identifying unusual sales activity.
  The practical purpose of this visualization is to understand the sales performance
  and variability among different product categories, aiding in better business decisions
  and identifying areas needing improvement. The annotations and highlights should
  make key insights stand out for quicker comprehension.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?\n2. Should the\
  \ chart include a title and labels for the axes? If so, what should they be?\n3.\
  \ How would you like the median sales to be highlighted (e.g., different color,\
  \ dashed line)?\n4. Are there specific product categories you want to emphasize\
  \ more within the chart?\n5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the annotations\
  \ and highlights?\n6. Do you have a preference for the style of text annotations\
  \ for outliers (e.g., font size, color)?\n7. Should the chart incorporate grid lines\
  \ or background shading to improve readability?\n8. Is there a specific order in\
  \ which product categories should be presented on the x-axis? \n9. Would you like\
  \ the sales values on the y-axis to use a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?\n\
  10. Are there any additional statistics or measures (e.g., mean, quartiles) you\
  \ want displayed on the chart?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a title and labels for the axes. The title can be "Sales
  Distribution Across Product Categories" and the axes labels can be "Product Categories"
  (x-axis) and "Sales" (y-axis).

  3. Different color would be great for highlighting the median sales.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, a legend to explain the annotations and highlights would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, grid lines would be useful to improve readability.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Linear scale for the y-axis, please.

  10. No additional statistics or measures are needed, just the median and the outliers.'
