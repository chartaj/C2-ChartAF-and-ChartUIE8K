initial_prompt: I need a bar chart showing total sales by each sub-category for the
  Superstore Sales Dataset. Use the categories Furniture, Office Supplies, and any
  others available in the data. Break down each category into its respective sub-categories
  and display their sales side by side to compare which sub-category performs the
  best in terms of sales. Ensure that all data is included without omissions for accurate
  representation. This will help identify top-selling sub-categories within each main
  category for better inventory and sales strategy planning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bar chart to display the sales values on top of each bar?

  3. How would you like to handle categories or sub-categories with very small sales
  values? Should they be shown or aggregated?

  4. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical bars for the bar chart?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font size and style for the labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines to make the comparisons easier?

  9. Do you want to highlight the top-selling sub-categories in any special way?'
