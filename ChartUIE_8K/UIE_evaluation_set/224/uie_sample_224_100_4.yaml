initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the sales trends over the order dates
  from the Superstore Sales Dataset. The x-axis should represent the "Order Date"
  and the y-axis should represent "Sales". Please include data points for individual
  sales transactions and show how sales change over the specified dates. Make sure
  the chart clearly shows trends and patterns for easy analysis. Additionally, differentiate
  the categories like "Furniture", "Office Supplies", and "Technology" using different
  colors or markers. Also, provide a legend to identify these categories. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the categories
  (Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology)?

  2. Do you have a specific date format that you would like to use for the x-axis
  labels?

  3. How would you prefer the data points to be marked (e.g., dots, squares, triangles)?

  4. Do you have any preferred settings for the grid lines (e.g., visibility, color,
  thickness)?

  5. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for different
  categories?

  7. Is there a specific range or scaling you prefer for the y-axis to better visualize
  sales?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or specific markers for important dates
  or events on the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels, title, and legend?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information in the tooltip when hovering
  over the data points?'
