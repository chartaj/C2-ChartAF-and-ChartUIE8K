initial_prompt: 'I need a column chart to visualize the Superstore sales data. The
  x-axis should represent the different regions: South, West, East, and Central. The
  y-axis should show the total sales figures for each region. Color-code the bars
  according to the various categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, and Technology.
  This will help in understanding the distribution of sales across regions and categories.
  Please ensure the chart is clearly labeled and easy to interpret with a legend distinguishing
  the categories. I want to analyze the performance of each product category in the
  different regions.'
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the categories?\n2. What font\
  \ style and size would you like for the labels?\n3. Should the y-axis values be\
  \ displayed in regular notation or a specific format (e.g., in thousands or millions)?\n\
  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart? If yes, what style of gridlines\
  \ do you prefer?\n5. Do you want any specific sorting order for the regions on the\
  \ x-axis?\n6. Are there any additional data labels you would like to display on\
  \ the chart (e.g., percentages, sales figures on bars)?\n7. How should the legend\
  \ be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right) on the chart? \n8. Would you prefer\
  \ if the chart includes any specific title or subtitle? If yes, what should it be?\n\
  9. Should the bars be displayed with any special effects such as gradients or borders?\n\
  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the bar width or spacing between bars?"
