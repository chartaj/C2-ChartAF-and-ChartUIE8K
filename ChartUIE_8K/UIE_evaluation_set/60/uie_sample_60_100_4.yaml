initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart per brand showing the average rating
  (aggregateRating/ratingValue) and total review count (aggregateRating/reviewCount)
  for each model. The x-axis should represent the brands, and each bar should be divided
  into sections for each model within the brand. Add another set of bars representing
  the average price (offers/price) where data is available. This will help visualize
  the customer feedback and pricing structure for various Windows laptops from Dell,
  Lenovo, etc. Make sure the chart visually contrasts between the rating, review count,
  and price data.

  count, and average price?

  3. Are there any specific brands or models you would like to highlight in the chart?

  4. Would you like the chart to include data labels for the values of average rating,
  review count, and average price?

  5. Do you prefer a particular order for the brands on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on average rating, etc.)?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key
  insights?
