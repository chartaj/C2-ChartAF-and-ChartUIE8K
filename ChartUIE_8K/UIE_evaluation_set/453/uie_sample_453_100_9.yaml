initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart visualizing gene expression data
  across different sample types from the dataset. The x-axis should represent the
  sample types (e.g., fetal_lung, 232-97_SCC), and the y-axis should display gene
  expression levels. Each gene should be represented by a different color in the stacks.
  The chart should highlight differences in expression levels across various samples,
  emphasizing variations for genes like IMAGE:196992, IMAGE:587847, and IMAGE:1049185.
  This visualization will help us understand the differential gene expression in lung
  tissues and various conditions like SCC and Adeno.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to represent
  each gene in the stacked column chart?

  2. Would you like to include error bars or any indication of variability in gene
  expression levels?

  3. Is there a particular order in which you would like the sample types to appear
  on the x-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to identify the genes, and if so, do you have
  a preference for its placement?

  6. Would you like the chart to have grid lines to enhance readability?

  7. Should we include labels for the gene expression levels on each bar segment?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart size or aspect ratio?

  9. Would you like to highlight specific sample types or genes in the chart for emphasis?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific preferences for the colors.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. No specific order, thanks.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include a legend. No preference for its placement.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Please highlight differences for genes like IMAGE:196992, IMAGE:587847, and IMAGE:1049185.
