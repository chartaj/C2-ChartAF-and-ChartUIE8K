initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot to visualize the gene expression data
  across different samples detailed in the provided dataset. Focus on comparing the
  distribution of values for specific genes, such as 'IMAGE:196992', 'IMAGE:587847',
  and 'IMAGE:1049185', across various conditions like 'fetal_lung', '232-97_SCC',
  '232-97_node', etc. Ensure the x-axis represents the sample categories, and the
  y-axis shows the expression levels. Highlight any significant differences in expression
  patterns among the samples. Use color coding to differentiate between different
  genes. This will help in understanding the variability and distribution of gene
  expression.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the color coding of
  different genes?

  2. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the plot (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed)?

  3. Would you like specific markers or annotations for significant differences in
  expression levels?

  4. Do you prefer any particular order for the sample categories on the x-axis?

  5. Are there any additional visual elements you would like to include, such as grid
  lines or legend positioning?

  6. Do you have a preference for the width or smoothing parameters of the violin
  plots?

  7. Would you like to include any titles or labels for the axes or overall chart?
  If so, please specify.'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Minimalist style would be preferable.

  3. Yes, specific markers or annotations for significant differences in expression
  levels would be helpful.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include titles and labels for the axes. "Sample Categories" for the
  x-axis, "Expression Levels" for the y-axis, and "Gene Expression Violin Plot" as
  the overall chart title.'
