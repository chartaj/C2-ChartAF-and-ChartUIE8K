initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing gene expression levels across different samples,
  including fetal lung, adenocarcinoma, SCC, LCLC, and SCLC. Use color gradients to
  represent expression values, with rows representing genes and columns representing
  sample types.
questions: '1. What color gradient would you prefer for representing gene expression
  values (e.g., red to blue, yellow to green)?

  2. Do you have a preference for the scale of the heatmap (e.g., log expression values,
  standardized values)?

  3. Should the heatmap include a color legend for easier interpretation?

  4. Would you like to cluster rows (genes) and/or columns (samples) to identify patterns
  or similarities?

  5. Do you want to highlight certain genes or sample types in a specific way (e.g.,
  bold labels, different color)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on the heatmap
  (e.g., sample type labels, gene function annotations)?

  7. What level of detail do you want for the gene labels (e.g., full gene names,
  abbreviated names)?

  8. Should any missing data be handled in a specific way (e.g., imputed, marked with
  a different color)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Standardized values would be preferable.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should include a color legend for easier interpretation.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I do not have any specific labels or annotations in mind.

  7. Full gene names would be good.

  8. I am not sure.'
