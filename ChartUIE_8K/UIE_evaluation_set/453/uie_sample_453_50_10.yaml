initial_prompt: Please create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize gene expression
  levels across different lung cancer types and conditions from the given dataset.
  Include all columns and highlight comparisons between adenocarcinoma and squamous
  cell carcinoma samples.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight adenocarcinoma
  and squamous cell carcinoma samples?

  2. Should we include legends or labels for each cancer type and condition?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the axes in the parallel coordinates chart?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to add to the chart
  for key data points?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for axis scaling (logarithmic, linear)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include legends or labels for each cancer type and condition.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.'
