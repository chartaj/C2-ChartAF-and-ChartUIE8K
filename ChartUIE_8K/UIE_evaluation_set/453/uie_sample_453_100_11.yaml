initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart using the provided gene expression data
  from the CSV file. The x-axis should represent the gene types, while the y-axis
  indicates expression levels. Use different colors to represent the various sample
  types (such as fetal lung, different Adeno types, SCC, LCLC, and SCLC among others).
  This visualization will help compare gene expression patterns across the different
  conditions and sample types. The chart should clearly show how the expression of
  various genes differs across the samples. Make sure to include a legend for easy
  identification of each sample type.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to represent
  each sample type in the chart?

  2. What level of detail do you prefer the legend to have for easy identification?

  3. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels within the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels'' fonts and sizes?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and its formatting?

  7. Are there any specific ordering or grouping preferences for the sample types
  displayed in the chart?

  8. Would you like to highlight any particular genes or sample types in the visualization?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or scaling of the y-axis (expression
  levels)?

  10. Would you like the chart to emphasize any particular trends or patterns in the
  gene expression data?'

  1. I do not know.

  2. The legend should be detailed enough to clearly distinguish between all sample
  types.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the chart should include gridlines for better readability.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the chart title and its formatting.

  7. I have no specific ordering or grouping preferences.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have any specific preference for the range or scaling of the y-axis.

  10. I would like the chart to emphasize any major trends or significant differences
  in gene expression levels between the sample types.
