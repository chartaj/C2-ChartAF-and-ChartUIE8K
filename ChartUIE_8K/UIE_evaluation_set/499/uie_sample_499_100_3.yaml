initial_prompt: I have a dataset with two columns, 'x' and 'y', both containing float
  values without missing data. This data seems to represent coordinates or some form
  of related measurements. I need a Hexagonal binning plot that uses both 'x' and
  'y' columns to visualize the distribution and density of points. Could you create
  this using these columns in a way that helps us understand the density variations
  across the dataset? Please use the sample data provided to generate the plot. Thank
  you!
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the hexagonal bins?\n\
  2. What level of detail would you prefer for the color gradient to indicate density\
  \ levels?\n3. Should there be axis labels or titles for the 'x' and 'y' columns?\
  \ If so, what should they be?\n4. Would you like to include a legend to indicate\
  \ the density levels? \n5. Do you prefer any specific aspect ratio for the plot?\n\
  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the plot?\n7. Is there a preference\
  \ for the number of hexagons (bin size) in the hexagonal binning plot?\n8. Should\
  \ there be any annotation for specific points or regions in the plot?\n9. Would\
  \ you like to apply any specific limits to the axes values (e.g., x-axis range,\
  \ y-axis range)?\n10. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the text elements\
  \ within the plot?"

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please label the axes. The x-axis should be labeled ''X Axis'' and the y-axis
  ''Y Axis''.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to indicate density levels.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.
