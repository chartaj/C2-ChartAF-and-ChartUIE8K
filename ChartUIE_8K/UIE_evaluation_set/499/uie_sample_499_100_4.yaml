initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing two columns, 'x' and 'y', with floating-point
  numbers. There are no missing values, and each column has 5 unique values. Can you
  create a spline chart to visualize this data? I'd like the x-axis to represent the
  'x' values and the y-axis to represent the 'y' values. The spline chart should have
  smooth curves connecting the data points to show the relationship between 'x' and
  'y'. Please make sure the chart is clear and easy to interpret, suitable for data
  analysis purposes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the spline chart?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include data point markers at each ''x'' and ''y'' value?

  4. Do you have a preferred font size and style for axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, even though there is only one data series?

  6. Should the spline chart have a title? If so, what should it be?

  7. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for the spline
  curve?

  8. Would you like any specific range or limits to be set for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Do you require annotations or callouts for specific data points?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.
