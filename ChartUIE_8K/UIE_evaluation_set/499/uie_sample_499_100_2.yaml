initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset with columns ''x'' and ''y'', where both are of
  float type with no missing values. Create a scatter plot to visualize this data.
  Highlight specific data points: for ''x'' values of 0.0, 1.0, and 2.0, show their
  corresponding ''y'' values as text annotations. Use different colors or sizes for
  these points to make them stand out. The goal is to emphasize these key points for
  further analysis, ensuring they are visually distinct to draw immediate attention.
  Provide context and insights on these points to help grasp the overall data trend.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used in the
  scatter plot?

  2. Should the scatter plot include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you want any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the background of the scatter plot be plain or shaded?

  6. Is there a preferred marker shape for the highlighted points (e.g., circle, square,
  triangle)?

  7. Should there be a legend explaining the highlighted points?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the size of the markers for the highlighted
  and non-highlighted points?

  9. Would you like the overall plot to include a title or a caption summarizing key
  insights?

  10. Is there a specific range or scale (linear or logarithmic) you prefer for the
  x and y axes?'
