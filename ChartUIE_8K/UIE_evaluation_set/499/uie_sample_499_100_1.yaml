initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the provided data, focusing on columns
  x and y. Highlight the main trends and any outliers in the data. Use text annotations
  to mark key data points or patterns that stand out, specifically values that are
  significantly higher or lower than the median. Also, include context annotations
  explaining any observed trends or unique values. This visual will be used for data
  analysis and insight extraction in a data science and analytics context. Ensure
  the chart is visually clear and informative to help users quickly grasp the key
  insights from the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the main trends
  and outliers?

  2. Should the text annotations be placed inside the box chart or outside it for

  size, font style, color)?

  4. Would you like the context annotations to include detailed explanations or just
  brief notes?

  5. Are there any particular patterns or data points that you expect to see highlighted
  in the chart?

  6. Do you have preferences for the axis titles and labels (e.g., specific wording,
  font style)?

  7. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color for differentiation?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout of the chart (e.g., aspect ratio,
  margins)?
