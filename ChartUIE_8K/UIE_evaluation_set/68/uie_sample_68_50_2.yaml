initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing cyber operation incidents over time.
  Highlight incidents based on type and sponsor. Add text annotations for selected
  high-profile attacks like those involving Ukraine, Russia, and Ghana. The focus
  should be on drawing attention to meaningful patterns in government and private
  sector involvement.

  of incidents?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot or prefer a cleaner

  visualization?
