initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing trends in state-sponsored cyber
  operations from 2005 to present. Highlight significant attacks in years with peaks.
  Annotate notable incidents with their descriptions and responses, emphasizing impacts
  on civil society, government, and private sectors. Utilize colors to differentiate
  between espionage, denial of service, and other types of attacks. Ensure the chart
  draws attention to years with missing data points, offering context for gaps. The
  visualization should make it easy to compare activity by sponsor and category over
  time. Tailor the chart to be insightful for cybersecurity analysts and policy makers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific format or style preferences for the annotations
  on notable incidents?

  2. What type of colors would you prefer for differentiating between espionage, denial
  of service, and other types of attacks?

  3. Do you have any particular preferences for the line styles or markers to be used
  for different types of attacks?

  4. Should the chart have a legend or key to explain the different colors and line
  styles used?

  5. Do you have a preference for how significant attacks in peak years should be
  highlighted (e.g., larger markers, different colors)?

  6. How would you like the missing data points to be indicated (e.g., dotted lines,
  specific markers)?

  7. Is there a preferred layout for the timeline (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly)?

  8. Should the impact on civil society, government, and private sectors be color-coded
  or have distinct markers?

  9. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart for easier comparison, and
  if so, in which direction (horizontal, vertical, or both)?

  10. Would you prefer any specific font or style for the axis labels and chart title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer distinct colors like blue for espionage, red for denial of service,
  and green for other types of attacks.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the chart should definitely have a legend or key to explain the different
  colors and line styles used.

  5. Larger markers for significant attacks in peak years would be great.

  6. I think using dotted lines for missing data points would be good.

  7. Yearly layout would be preferred.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Both horizontal and vertical gridlines would be helpful for easier comparison.

  10. I do not have a specific preference for the font or style for the axis labels
  and chart title.'
