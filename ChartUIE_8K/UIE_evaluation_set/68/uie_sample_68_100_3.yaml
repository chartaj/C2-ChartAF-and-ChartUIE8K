initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing state-sponsored cyber operations from
  2005 to the present. Each bar should represent a different country involved as a
  sponsor. The y-axis will show the number of operations, while the x-axis will list
  countries like Ghana, Belarus, Ukraine, etc. The chart should highlight categories
  such as Civil Society, Government, and Private Sector. Include labels that show
  type (Espionage, Denial of Service) and number of victims, like political dissidents
  or state entities. Data sources should be indicated. This detail will help in understanding
  the scale and impact of cyber activities.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating the categories
  (Civil Society, Government, Private Sector)?

  2. Should the bar chart include a legend to explain the colors, categories, and
  labels used?

  3. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the chart labels and
  titles?

  4. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for easier comparison of values?

  5. Do you prefer the bars to be arranged in any specific order, such as alphabetically
  by country, or by the number of operations?

  6. Should there be any specific emphasis or highlight on certain countries or categories
  within the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, please specify.

  8. Is there a need for additional annotations or notes on the chart to provide further
  context or explanations?

  9. How should the data sources be indicated on the chartâ€”preferably as a footnote,
  or integrated within the chart area?

  10. Do you have a specific preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  chart?'
