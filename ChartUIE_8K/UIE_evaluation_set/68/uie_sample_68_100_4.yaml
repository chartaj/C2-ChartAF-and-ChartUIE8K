initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart illustrating the number of unique values
  for each column category given in the dataset regarding "State-Sponsored Cyber Operations
  (2005-Present)". Each bar should represent a column such as 'Title', 'Date', 'Affiliations',
  etc., and stacked segments should show various categories like 'Espionage', 'Denial
  of service', etc. Ensure that colors distinguish between different operation types
  or categories. Include labels for the columns and a legend for operation categories.
  This will help visualize the distribution and diversity of unique attributes across
  various cyber operations.
