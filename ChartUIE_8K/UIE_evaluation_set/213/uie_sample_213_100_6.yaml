initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the NYS Golf Courses data. The chart
  should display each "State Park" on the X-axis and the number of unique "Course
  Names" for each park on the Y-axis. This will help understand which parks offer
  the most variety in golf courses. Each bar should be labeled with the corresponding
  "County" for additional context. Also, include a color-coded legend indicating the
  different "Regions" each park is located in. Make sure all park names are legible
  and the chart is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the color-coded legend
  representing the regions?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for easier readability of values?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the labels to ensure
  all park names are legible?

  4. Should the bars be displayed in a particular order, such as alphabetically or
  by the number of unique course names?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels'' wording
  and style?

  6. Would you prefer to see the exact number of unique course names shown directly
  on the bars?

  7. Do you have any specific margin or spacing preferences for the bars to make the
  chart more visually appealing?

  8. Is there a particular background color you would like for the chart for better
  contrast or visual appeal?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement of the legend (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?'
