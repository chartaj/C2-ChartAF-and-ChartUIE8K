initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for me using the NYS Golf Courses data.
  Track the Latitude and Longitude points across different Courses in each State Park.
  The x-axis should show the 'Course Name' and the y-axis should show 'Latitude' and
  'Longitude'. This will help visualize the geographic distribution of golf courses
  within different state parks across New York. Color-code the lines based on the
  'State Park' to differentiate them easily. This will give insights into how golf
  courses are spread out in various regions and counties. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the lines representing
  different State Parks?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include data labels for ''Latitude'' and ''Longitude'' values
  on each point?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style or format for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific legends or annotations you would like to add to the chart?

  6. What font style and size do you prefer for the chart''s title and labels?

  7. Do you have a preferred ordering for the ''Course Name'' on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by region)?

  8. Would you like any additional reference lines or markers for specific ''Latitude''
  and ''Longitude'' ranges?'
