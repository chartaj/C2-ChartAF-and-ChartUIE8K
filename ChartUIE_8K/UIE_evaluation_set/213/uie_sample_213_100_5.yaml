initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing NYS Golf Courses from the provided
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the Longitude, and the y-axis should represent
  the Latitude. Each point on the scatter plot will represent a specific golf course,
  with different colors used to differentiate courses in various State Parks. Tooltips
  on the scatter points should display the State Park and Course Name for better context.
  Please ensure the map is plotted accurately with proper longitude and latitude scales
  and labeled axes. This will help in visualizing the geographic distribution of the
  golf courses across New York State.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for differentiating
  the State Parks?

  2. Do you prefer any particular style for the scatter plot points (e.g., circles,
  squares)?

  3. Would you like the axes to have grid lines for easier reading, or do you prefer
  a cleaner look?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and tooltips?

  5. Would you like to include a legend on the scatter plot to identify the color
  association with each State Park?

  6. Do you want to have a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should the title
  be?

  7. Are there any specific longitude and latitude ranges that you would like to focus
  on in the plot?

  8. Would you like to add geographical features (e.g., rivers, state boundaries)
  to the background of the scatter plot for better context?'
