initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing golf course distributions across different
  regions and counties in New York State Parks. Highlight regions with higher densities,
  and use text annotations to display specific values where densities are highest.
  This will help to quickly identify key areas of interest for golf enthusiasts and
  park management, focusing especially on Suffolk County as seen in the sample data.
  Ensure the chart is user-friendly and visually emphasizes critical data points for
  effective analysis. Provide contextual and orientation annotations to help users
  understand the golf facility locations in relation to municipal boundaries and zip
  codes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What density thresholds should be used to highlight regions with higher densities?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be styled (font, size, color)?

  4. Should the heatmap include labels for all counties or only those with higher
  densities?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the heatmap (portrait or landscape)?

  6. Should municipal boundaries and zip codes be displayed as overlays on the heatmap?

  7. Would you prefer any specific map projection for geographical accuracy?

  8. Are there any additional contextual annotations you would like to include?'
