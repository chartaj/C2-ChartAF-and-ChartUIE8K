initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the distribution of NYS Golf
  Courses. The chart should plot each golf course with their respective longitude
  and latitude, using color intensity to represent the density of golf courses in
  various counties. Ensure the map includes markers for "State Park," "Course Name,"
  and highlights the regions and counties. Use the 'Facility URL' and 'Golf URL' for
  interactive elements, allowing users to click and get more information about each
  golf course. The heatmap should help understand the geographic spread and accessibility
  of golf courses across New York State.

  4. How detailed should the county boundaries be displayed?

  5. Should the markers for golf courses have different shapes or colors for easier
  differentiation?

  7. Would you like tooltips to display additional information when hovering over
  markers?'
