initial_prompt: I need a network diagram that shows the academic collaboration between
  universities. The nodes represent the universities, and the edges show the connections
  or collaborations between them. Use data from the CSV to visualize this. Each node
  should be labeled with the university name (like Harvard, MIT, Stanford), and the
  edges should connect based on the 'source' and 'target' values. The 'value' column
  can represent the strength or frequency of collaboration. Please ensure missing
  values are handled appropriately in the visualization. This will help us understand
  how these institutions are interconnected in education and research collaborations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the nodes or edges?

  2. Should the node size vary based on any specific attribute, such as the number
  of collaborations?

  3. Do you prefer specific shapes for the nodes to represent different types of universities
  or collaborations?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like missing values to be represented or
  handled in the visualization?

  5. Would you like the edges to be weighted or styled differently based on the strength
  or frequency of the collaboration?

  6. Do you want any specific labels or annotations on the edges to indicate the strength
  or frequency of the collaborations?

  7. Are there any specific universities you want to highlight or focus on in the
  diagram?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the network diagram (e.g., circular, hierarchical,
  force-directed)?

  9. Should there be a legend or key included to explain the visual encoding of the
  attributes?

  10. Are there any additional data points or contextual information youâ€™d like included
  in the visualization?'
