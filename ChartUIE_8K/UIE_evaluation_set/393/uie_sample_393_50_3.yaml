initial_prompt: Create a network diagram showing the academic collaboration between
  universities based on their connections. Visualize nodes for universities and links
  for their collaboration. Differentiate collaborations through varying link thickness
  or color intensity by value.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the collaboration links?

  2. Should we use a specific color palette to represent the varying intensity of
  collaborations?

  3. Are there any specific universities or collaborations you would like to highlight
  particularly?

  4. Would you prefer the node sizes to vary based on the number of collaborations
  or to be uniform?

  5. Should labels on the nodes (university names) be always visible or appear only
  on hover?

  6. Is there a desired layout for the network diagram (e.g., circular, hierarchical,
  force-directed)?

  7. Would you like to include any other data elements or annotations (e.g., collaborative
  project names, number of papers)?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the thickness range of the collaboration
  links to denote the strength of collaborations?'
