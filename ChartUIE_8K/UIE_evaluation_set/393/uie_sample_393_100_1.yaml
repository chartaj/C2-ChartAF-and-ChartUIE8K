initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the academic collaborations
  between universities. The chart should display the number of collaborations each
  university has. Highlight the top three universities with the most collaborations
  by changing their bar colors. Also, add data-driven annotations for these top universities,
  displaying the exact number of collaborations. This will help emphasize the most
  collaborative institutions clearly and draw viewer attention to significant data
  points first before examining other universities. Include a simple title and label
  the axes for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the bar chart?

  2. Do you prefer particular colors for highlighting the top three universities?

  3. Would you like the bars to be sorted in ascending or descending order based on
  the number of collaborations?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would like used for the annotations
  and labels?

  5. Do you have any preference for the format or style of the data-driven annotations
  for the top universities?

  6. How would you like the axes to be labeled (i.e., the exact wording)?

  7. Do you want gridlines to be displayed in the chart, and if so, in a specific
  style or color?'

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer them in descending order based on the number of collaborations.
