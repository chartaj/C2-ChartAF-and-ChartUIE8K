initial_prompt: Please create a Treemap to visualize the academic collaborations between
  universities based on the provided data. Use the 'Type' to differentiate nodes from
  other types. The 'id' and 'name' fields should label the nodes representing different
  universities. Highlight the connections between universities by mapping the 'source'
  and 'target' fields. Use 'value' to size the nodes or connections if possible. The
  chart should clearly depict the network of collaborations, making it easy to identify
  which universities are most interconnected. Ensure the Treemap is intuitive and
  conveys the relationships effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different ''Type'' nodes?

  2. How would you like the ''value'' attribute to influence the size of the nodes
  or connections?

  3. Should there be any specific color or style to highlight the most interconnected
  universities?

  4. Do you have preferences for the labels'' font size or style for the ''name''
  field?

  5. Would you prefer any specific layout or organization within the Treemap?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or tooltips you would like to include for
  clarity?

  7. Do you have a preferred level of detail for the nodes and connections?

  8. Should the chart include a legend or key for easier interpretation?'
