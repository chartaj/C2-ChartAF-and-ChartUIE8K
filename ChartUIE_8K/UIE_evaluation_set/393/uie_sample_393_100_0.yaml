initial_prompt: I need a pie chart visualizing the information on academic collaboration
  between universities. Highlight the distribution of the 'Type' column, splitting
  it into 'nodes' and other types. Use text annotations to show unique university
  names like 'Harvard,' 'MIT,' and 'Stanford.' Highlight the segments for these universities
  to emphasize their collaboration values. This will help in focusing the viewer's
  attention on these major universities before looking at others. Use different colors
  and make the annotated segments stand out visually for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the different ''Type'' segments?

  2. Are there any preferred colors for highlighting the segments for ''Harvard,''
  ''MIT,'' and ''Stanford''?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you want the chart to have a legend? If so, any specific preferences on its
  placement or style?

  5. Should the chart include a title? If yes, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout or order of the segments in the pie
  chart?

  7. Would you like the highlighted segments to have any additional visual effects,
  such as bold borders or shadows?

  8. Do you prefer any specific type of labels for the segments, such as names, percentages,
  or both?'
