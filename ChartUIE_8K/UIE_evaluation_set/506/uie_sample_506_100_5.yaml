initial_prompt: 'I need a diverging bar chart to visualize the winrate difference
  between games played from the blue side and the red side for each champion in the
  dataset. For each champion, show two bars: one for Winrate(B) and one for Winrate(R),
  diverging from a central axis. Include the champion names on the y-axis and the
  winrate percentages on the x-axis. This will help identify which side each champion
  performs better on.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the bars representing Winrate(B)
  and Winrate(R)?

  2. Do you have any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the champion
  names and winrate percentages?

  3. Should the bars have data labels displaying the exact winrate percentages?

  4. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the champions on the y-axis, such as
  alphabetical order or descending winrate difference?

  5. Is there a particular width or spacing you desire between the bars for better
  visual distinction?

  6. Would you like a legend included to distinguish between Winrate(B) and Winrate(R)?

  7. Are there any specific gridline preferences or background colors you want for
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, use something that distinguishes
  the sides clearly.

  2. I do not know, use default settings for the fonts and sizes.

  3. Yes, the bars should have data labels displaying the exact winrate percentages.

  4. I prefer the champions to be ordered by descending winrate difference.

  5. I do not have any specific preference for the width or spacing between the bars.

  6. Yes, include a legend to distinguish between Winrate(B) and Winrate(R).

  7. I have no specific preferences for the gridlines or background colors.'
