initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart that visualizes the win rates and
  loss rates of various champions from the given data. Each group should represent
  a champion and include separate bars for win rates (Winrate) and loss rates (Loss).
  Use text annotations to highlight the champions with the highest and lowest win
  rates. The purpose of this chart is to compare the performance of different champions
