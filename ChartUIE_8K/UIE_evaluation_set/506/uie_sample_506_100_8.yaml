initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize each champion's Winrate across different
  games in the dataset provided. The x-axis should represent the different champions,
  and the y-axis should show the Winrate percentages. Each dot will represent a specific
  game's Winrate (%), categorized by "Games(B)" (Games as Blue side) and "Games(R)"
  (Games as Red side). Additionally, use different colors to distinguish between the
  Winrates(B) and Winrates(R). This will help in comparing the performance of champions
  on both sides of the game. Make sure to include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to distinguish between
  Winrate(B) and Winrate(R)?

  2. Would you like the x-axis labels to be rotated for better readability?

  3. How would you like the dots to be sized? Should they be uniform or should they
  vary based on another metric?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines in the background to enhance readability?

  6. Do you prefer a particular position for the legend (top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Should any specific champions or data points be highlighted or annotated for
  emphasis?

  8. Do you prefer a specific style for the dots (e.g., filled circles, hollow circles)?

  9. Is there a preferred background color for the plot area?'
