initial_prompt: Please create a box chart comparing the Winrate, Winrate(B), and Winrate(R)
  for each Champion from the dataset. The box chart should have the Champions on the
  x-axis and the Winrates on the y-axis. Separate boxes should represent Winrate,
  Winrate(B), and Winrate(R) for each Champion to visualize the distribution and spread
  of these win rates. This will help to easily compare the performance of each champion
  in general, on the Blue team, and on the Red team.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. Should the chart have a title? If so, what should it be?

  3. Do you want grid lines displayed on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical orientation for the x-axis labels?

  5. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where should it be
  positioned?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type and size used in the chart?

  7. Should the y-axis be displayed with percentage symbols since win rates are percentages?

  8. Would you like to add data labels that display the exact win rates on the chart?'
