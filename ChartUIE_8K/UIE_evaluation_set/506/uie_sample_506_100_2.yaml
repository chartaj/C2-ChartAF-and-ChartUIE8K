initial_prompt: 'Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of games played by
  each champion across the dataset. Each slice should represent a different champion,
  with annotations indicating their respective win rates. Highlight the champions
  with the top three win rates by changing their slice colors to more vibrant hues,
  such as bright red or green. This will help to focus attention on the most successful
  champions. Additionally, add a title to the chart for clarity: "Champion Game Distribution
  and Win Rates." This visualization will help in quickly identifying which champions
  are most frequently played and which have the highest success rates.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the slices representing
  the top three win rate champions?

  2. How would you like the rest of the slices to be colored? Should they follow a
  specific color scheme or pattern?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations indicating
  the win rates?

  4. Should the annotations for win rates be placed inside the slices or outside them
  with leader lines?

  5. Would you like to include a legend for the champions, or should their names be
  directly displayed on the chart slices?

  6. Is there any specific format for the title "Champion Game Distribution and Win
  Rates," such as a particular font style or alignment?

  7. Would you like to include the numerical values for the number of games played
  alongside the champion names on the slices?

  8. Are there any specific spacing or layout preferences for the pie chart, such
  as spacing between slices or any 3D effects?'
