initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize champion performance in terms of
  win rate across different scenarios. Use the "Champion" column for the x-axis and
  "Winrate" for the y-axis. Include markers for "Winrate(B)" and "Winrate(R)" in different
  colors to show win rates for Blue and Red sides. Ensure that each champion's overall
  win rate and side-specific win rates are clearly distinguishable. Include a legend
  to differentiate between the markers. Make sure the plot is labeled appropriately
  and the axis ranges are suitable to display all data points without clutter.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the markers representing
  Winrate(B) and Winrate(R)?

  2. Would you like any specific shapes for the markers to differentiate between the
  overall win rate and side-specific win rates?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top-right, bottom-left,
  etc.)?

  4. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Are there any particular axis ranges or scales you would like to set for the
  x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you prefer to have a grid in the background to enhance readability?

  7. Is there any specific title you would like to give to the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have any specific preference on how to handle overlapping markers to avoid
  clutter (e.g., jittering markers, transparency, etc.)?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or labels on specific data points?'
