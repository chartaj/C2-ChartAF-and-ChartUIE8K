initial_prompt: 'Create a box plot for weather predictions. The x-axis should represent
  different weather types: ''drizzle'', ''rain'', etc. The y-axis should show wind
  speeds. Plot the distribution of wind speeds for each weather type. Include labels,
  a title, and a legend. This should help visualize how wind speeds vary with weather
  conditions over time. Use data from 225.csv provided. Ensure the plot is clear and
  easily interpretable for quick insights into weather and wind speed patterns.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box plot?

  2. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be included in the plot for better readability?
