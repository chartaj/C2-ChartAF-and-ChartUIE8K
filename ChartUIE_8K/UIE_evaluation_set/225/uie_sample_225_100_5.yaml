initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the weather data. Use the 'date'
  on the x-axis and 'temp_max' and 'temp_min' on the y-axis. Differentiate points
  by 'weather' using colors or markers to see how maximum and minimum temperatures
  vary across different weather conditions like drizzle, rain, etc. Include a legend
  to explain the weather types represented by different colors or markers. Make sure
  to label the axes appropriately and add a title "Temperature Variation Across Different
  Weather Conditions" for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent different
  weather conditions?

  2. Do you prefer distinct shapes for markers to differentiate weather types, in
  addition to colors?

  3. Are there any font styles or sizes you prefer for the axes labels and title?

  4. Would you like grid lines in the background to enhance readability? If yes, should
  they be minor or major grid lines?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the range or scaling of the axes?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific location within the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  7. Do you need any specific annotations or reference lines included in the chart?

  8. Would you like to add any additional information or captions to the chart?'
