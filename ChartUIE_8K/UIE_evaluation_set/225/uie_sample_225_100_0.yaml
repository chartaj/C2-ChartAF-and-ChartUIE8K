initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the weather data, focusing on precipitation,
  temperature, and wind attributes from 2012. Annotate specific bars representing
  significant values, like the highest and lowest points of precipitation and temperature.
  Use color highlights to distinguish between different weather conditions (e.g.,
  drizzle, rain). Provide data-driven text annotations for these highlighted points
  to illustrate key observations. This will help to understand trends and anomalies
  in weather patterns over time. Make sure annotations draw attention to noteworthy
  elements without cluttering the chart, aiding both clarity and insight.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart, especially for
  highlighting different weather conditions?

  2. Are there specific months or periods within 2012 that you want to emphasize?

  3. How would you like the bars to be grouped or segmented by time (e.g., daily,
  weekly, monthly)?

  4. Do you prefer specific fonts or text styles for the annotations?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reading of values?

  6. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?

  7. How do you prefer to display the temperature values: stacked together or separately
  for maximum and minimum?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the weather conditions?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Monthly would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Separately for maximum and minimum would be better.

  8. Yes, a legend would be helpful.'
