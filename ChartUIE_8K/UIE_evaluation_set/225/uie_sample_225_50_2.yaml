initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the weather data, focusing on temperature
  variations and precipitation. Use text annotations to highlight extreme temperature
  and high precipitation days. Add highlights to emphasize patterns over time, especially
  in weather changes and wind speeds, aiding predictive analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap (e.g.,
  cool to warm colors, monochromatic)?

  2. How would you like the extreme values to be annotated (e.g., specific icons,
  bold text, color-coded)?

  3. Should the text annotations include just the value or any additional information
  (e.g., date, percentile)?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., monthly view, weekly view,
  continuous timeline)?

  5. Do you prefer the heatmap to be clustered by any specific variable (e.g., date,
  temperature range)?

  6. How detailed should the highlights showing patterns over time be (e.g., trend
  lines, moving averages)?

  7. What level of granularity do you want for the time patterns (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  8. Should wind speeds be visualized on a separate axis or integrated within the
  heatmap?

  9. Would you like any additional context or labels on the axes (e.g., unit measurements,
  categorical indicators)?

  10. Do you require a legend or key to explain the color mappings and highlights
  on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Bold text would be good.

  3. Just the value.

  4. I prefer a monthly view.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Weekly granularity.

  8. Integrated within the heatmap.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Yes, a legend or key would be helpful.'
