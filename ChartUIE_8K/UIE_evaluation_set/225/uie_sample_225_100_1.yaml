initial_prompt: <start of the annotation list> Create a histogram using the weather
  dataset, focusing on the 'temp_max' column to visualize the distribution of maximum
  temperatures over the recorded period. Highlight the bins with most frequent temperatures
  distinctively. Use text annotations to emphasize specific frequency values and make
  them stand out. The purpose of this visualization is to understand how extreme or
  mild the weather has been across the years. Provide additional context about unusual
  temperature patterns if any. Ensure all chart elements are clearly labeled for better
  understanding. <end of the annotation list>
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bins and highlights in
  the histogram?

  2. What range of temperatures would you consider as ''extreme'' or ''unusual''?

  3. Would you like a specific bin width for the histogram, or should it be auto-calculated?

  4. How would you like unusual temperature patterns to be represented on the chart?

  5. Do you want any specific labels or legends for highlighted temperature bins?

  6. Are there any specific years or periods you want to focus on within the recorded
  timeframe?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of text annotations?

  8. Would you like the axis titles to be formatted in a particular way, e.g., font
  size or style?

  9. Should the chart include a title or subtitle? If yes, do you have any specific
  wording in mind?

  10. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded from the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I would consider temperatures above 35°C or below 0°C as ''extreme''.

  3. I do not have a specific preference, auto-calculated is fine.

  4. I am not sure how they should be represented.

  5. No, I do not need specific labels or legends for the highlighted bins.

  6. I do not have any specific years or periods to focus on.

  7. I am not sure about the placement and style of text annotations.

  8. I do not know about the axis titles, no specific preference.

  9. Yes, please include a title. Something like "Distribution of Maximum Temperatures
  Over the Years".

  10. I do not have a preference about gridlines.'
