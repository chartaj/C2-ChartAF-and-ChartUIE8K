initial_prompt: "Visualize weather data focusing on temperature ranges and precipitation.\
  \ \nCreate histograms for temp_max, temp_min, and precipitation, annotated with\
  \ specific values. \nHighlight extreme weather conditions using different colors\
  \ for clarity."
questions: '1. Do you have preferred color schemes for highlighting extreme weather
  conditions?

  2. Are there specific threshold values for what you consider as ''extreme'' weather
  conditions for temperature and precipitation?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the histograms (e.g., side-by-side or overlaid)?

  4. Should the annotations for specific values be displayed as labels, tooltips,
  or another format?

  5. Do you prefer a specific bin width or number of bins for the histograms?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between different temperature
  ranges and precipitation levels?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the axes and the chart
  overall?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for annotations and labels?'
