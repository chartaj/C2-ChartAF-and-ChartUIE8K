initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the strength of the top
  10 passwords from the dataset. Use the 'rank' as the x-axis and 'strength' as the
  y-axis. Each bar should represent a password's rank and its corresponding strength.
  Add labels to each bar showing the password category. Also, include a title "Top
  10 Password Strengths" and make sure each rank's password is clearly labeled. Pay
  attention to color-coding the bars based on the 'category' to differentiate them
  easily. Ensure the chart is visually appealing and easy to understand for better
  cybersecurity awareness.
