initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the relationship between the
  offline_crack_sec and strength values for the different passwords in the provided
  dataset. Use rank as the y-axis and password category as the x-axis. Color the cells
  based on the offline_crack_sec values. Highlight the cells using strength values
  as an overlay to display different security levels of passwords. This will help
  in understanding how difficult it is to crack various categories of passwords and
  which categories generally have stronger passwords. Incorporate font_size for additional
  granularity if possible. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to represent offline_crack_sec
  values?

  2. How would you like the overlay for the strength values to be displayed (e.g.,
  varying cell border thickness, text annotations)?

  3. Should the font_size be directly displayed on the heatmap cells, or should it
  be used as a scaling factor for some visual attribute (e.g., cell size)?

  4. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include on the axes
  or within the heatmap?

  5. Would you prefer a specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Text annotations would be good for displaying the strength values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. The title could be "Heatmap of Password Categories vs. Offline Crack Time", with
  a subtitle of "Strength values annotated within cells".'
