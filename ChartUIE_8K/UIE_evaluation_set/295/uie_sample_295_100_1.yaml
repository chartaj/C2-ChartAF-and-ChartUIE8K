initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the Conversion Rate and
  Click-Through Rate by Campaign Channel. Use highlights to emphasize the channels
  with the highest and lowest Conversion Rates. Add text annotations to display the
  exact Conversion Rates and Click-Through Rates for each channel on the bars. The
