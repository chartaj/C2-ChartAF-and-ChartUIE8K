initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the trend of AdSpend, ClickThroughRate,
  and ConversionRate over different Age groups for a digital marketing dataset. Each
  line should represent one of these metrics, with Age on the x-axis and the metric
  values on the y-axis. Additionally, differentiate the lines by CampaignChannel (Social
  Media, Email, PPC, etc.) to see how AdSpend, ClickThroughRate, and ConversionRate
  vary by each channel across ages. This should provide a clear view of how marketing
  efforts translate into performance metrics. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the lines representing
  different metrics?

  2. How would you like the CampaignChannels differentiated? (e.g., line style, color,
  markers)

  3. Should the y-axis be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  4. Do you prefer any particular labeling or title format for the chart and axes?

  5. Would you like to include a legend? If so, where would you like it to be placed?

  6. Should any specific data points (e.g., peaks, dips) be highlighted or annotated?

  7. Would you like to display gridlines for better readability?

  8. Is there a specific age range or interval that should be focused on or detailed?'
