initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of flight counts
  ('cnt') across different routes. Highlight the range and central tendency of the
  data, annotating the airlines and airports involved. Ensure to emphasize significant
  variances within the data. The goal is to understand the concentration and spread
  of flight counts and identify trends in travel routes and airline activity. Use
  text annotations to highlight key data points and enhance readability. This visualization
  will aid in identifying popular travel routes and airlines operating those routes
  efficiently.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different airlines
  and airports?

  2. Do you prefer a particular aspect ratio or figure size for the plot?

  3. Are there any specific key data points you would like to highlight with text
  annotations?

  4. Do you want to include a legend, and if so, where should it be located?

  5. Should the central tendency be displayed as mean, median, or both?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the annotations (e.g., font size, font type,
  and color)?

  7. Are there any specific routes or airlines that should be emphasized more prominently
  in the visualization?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the range of the y-axis (flight counts)?

  9. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability?

  10. Is there a need for any additional context or notes to be included with the
  chart?'
