initial_prompt: I'd like to generate a geographic heatmap based on the travel data
  in the CSV file. The heatmap should display flight routes starting from 'start_lat'
  and 'start_lon' to 'end_lat' and 'end_lon', with intensity or thickness of lines
  indicating 'cnt' values (number of flights). Each route should be color-coded by
  the 'airline'. The starting and ending points, represented by 'airport1' and 'airport2',
  should be marked as well. This visualization will help to identify the most frequent
  routes and the dominance of specific airlines. Please ensure the map is interactive
  for better user experience.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the airline routes?

  2. How would you like the starting and ending points (airports) to be marked on
  the map (e.g. circles, icons)?

  3. Would you like to display labels for the airports on the map?

  4. What type of base map do you prefer for the geographic heatmap (e.g. street map,
  satellite imagery, terrain)?

  5. Is there a specific geographic area you would like the map to focus on initially?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color-coding of the airlines and
  the line thickness for flight counts?

  7. Should the intensity or thickness of the lines representing the number of flights
  have a specific scale or range?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or details you would like to include on
  the map?

  9. Do you have a preference for the size or resolution of the visual elements (e.g.
  line thickness, marker size)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Circles would be good for marking starting and ending points.

  3. Yes, I would like to display labels for the airports.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color-coding of the airlines and
  the line thickness for flight counts.

  7. I do not have a specific scale or range in mind.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
