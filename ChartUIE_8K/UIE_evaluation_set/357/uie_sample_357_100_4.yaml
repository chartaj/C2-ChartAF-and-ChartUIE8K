initial_prompt: I need a geographic heatmap to visualize the churn data. I want the
  heatmap to show the distribution of customers across different geographical regions
  (Geography column). The map should highlight areas with higher churn rates (Exited
  column) compared to other regions. The color intensity should represent the churn
  levels, with a clear legend. Also, include details like the number of active members
  (IsActiveMember) and credit scores (CreditScore) for each region to provide additional
  insights. This will help understand where to focus retention strategies for mitigating
  churn in the business.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer the map to be displayed using a particular geographic projection?

  3. What level of granularity do you prefer for geographic regions (e.g., country,
  state, city)?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the map?

  5. Would you like any specific labeling or annotations on the map?

  6. Do you prefer specific data aggregation methods for displaying the number of
  active members and credit scores (e.g., mean, median)?

  7. What range of values would you like to see highlighted in the legend for churn
  levels?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style and size for texts and labels on the map?

  9. Should the heatmap include any additional overlays or markers to highlight specific
  regions?'
