initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that visualizes customer churn in the banking sector.
  Using the provided data, create a chart showing the count of customers who exited
  vs. those who didn't. Use the 'Exited' column for this. This should help us understand
  the distribution of churned vs. retained customers. Include labels for clarity and
  make sure the chart is easy to interpret. This will be crucial for our business
  analysis to further improve customer retention strategies. Please ensure the chart
  looks professional, as it will be used in a presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''Exited'' and ''Not Exited'' customers?

  2. Would you like the chart title to include additional context, such as the banking
  sector or a specific time period?

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for this bar chart?

  4. Should we include a legend indicating what each bar represents, or do you prefer
  a simple label directly on the bars?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to use for the labels
  and title to ensure clarity?

  6. Should the y-axis show the exact count of customers or would you prefer it to
  be in percentage terms?

  7. Do you have a preference for the background color or gridlines style of the chart?

  8. Is there a specific format or layout preferred for the presentation where this
  chart will be used?

  9. Would you like any additional text annotations or insights included within the
  chart to emphasize key points?'
