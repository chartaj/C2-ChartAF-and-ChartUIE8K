initial_prompt: Please generate a stacked bar chart to visualize the customer churn
  data. Each bar should represent a country (Geography), stacked by the number of
  customers who exited and didnâ€™t exit (Exited). Use colors to differentiate between
  exited and not exited customers. Highlight the "Geography" categories with the highest
  churn rates. Annotate the bars with the exact count of exited customers to draw
  attention to them. This will help in understanding the churn distribution across
  different regions and identify high-risk areas. The chart should make it easy to
  compare churn rates across countries.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for exited and not exited customers?

  2. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the annotations?

  3. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar labels (horizontal or
  vertical)?

  5. Is there a specific way you want to highlight the "Geography" categories with
  the highest churn rates (e.g., different color, bold outline)?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  7. Do you want the bars to be ordered in any specific way (e.g., ascending or descending
  order based on churn rates)?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the gridlines (e.g., should they be
  visible or not)?

  9. Would you like to include axis labels? If so, do you have a specific text in
  mind for these labels?

  10. Do you want any specific margins or padding around the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific colors for exited and not exited customers.

  2. I do not have a preferred font size and style for the annotations, but they should
  be clearly readable.

  3. Yes, please include a title: "Customer Churn by Geography" and a subtitle: "Comparison
  of Exited and Not Exited Customers".

  4. Horizontal orientation for the bar labels would be fine.

  5. I am not sure about the specific way to highlight the "Geography" categories
  with the highest churn rates.

  6. I do not know about the legend position, whatever looks best.

  7. Yes, please order the bars in descending order based on churn rates.

  8. I do not have specific requirements for the gridlines.

  9. Yes, include axis labels. For the y-axis: "Number of Customers" and for the x-axis:
  "Geography".

  10. I do not have any specific preferences for margins or padding around the chart.'
