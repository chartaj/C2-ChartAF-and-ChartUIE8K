initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the data from the provided CSV file.
  Focus on plotting 'x' against 'y'. Include text annotations to highlight significant
  data points, such as the minimum, maximum, and any notable inflection points on
  the curve. Use highlights to differentiate these key points visually. This chart
  is intended for a data science and analytics presentation, aiming to draw viewers'
  attention to trends and variations in the dataset. The annotations and highlights
  should aid in quickly identifying and understanding the significance of these points.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line and highlighted
  points?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability?
  If so, should they be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  3. Should the chart include a legend or labels for the data series?

  4. Are there specific styles or fonts you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you want the line to be smoothed (e.g., with spline interpolation) or should
  it be a straight line connecting the points?

  6. How would you like the inflection points to be marked (e.g., with a specific
  shape or icon)?

  7. Do you have preferences for the chart title or axis labels?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios that you anticipate for the
  chart display?'

  6. I would like inflection points to be marked with a distinct shape, like a star
  or diamond.
