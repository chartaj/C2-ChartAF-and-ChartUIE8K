initial_prompt: 'Please create a histogram using the data provided in the CSV file
  located at ''../Extra_datas/data/498.csv''. The dataset contains two columns: ''x''
  and ''y'', both of which are float64 data types and have no missing values. Display
  the distribution of ''x'' and ''y'' values in two separate histograms. It would
  be helpful if the histogram also includes axis labels, a title, and appropriate
  bins to visually represent the spread and frequency of data points for both ''x''
  and ''y''. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histograms?

  2. How many bins would you prefer for each histogram, or should they be automatically
  determined?

  3. Would you like grid lines included in the histograms?

  4. Do you have specific titles in mind for each of the histograms?

  5. Is there a preference for the orientation of the histograms (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Would you like to add annotations or data labels to any specific parts of the
  histograms?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, automatically determined bins should be fine.

  3. Yes, grid lines included would be helpful.

  4. I do not have specific titles in mind.

  5. Vertical orientation for the histograms is preferred.

  6. I do not have any specific font style or size preferences.

  7. I am not sure.'
