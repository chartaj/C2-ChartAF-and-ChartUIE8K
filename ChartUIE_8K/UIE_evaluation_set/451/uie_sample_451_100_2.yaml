initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the Dow Jones Industrial Average over
  time, with annotations highlighting significant peaks and troughs. Emphasize key
  dates from the sample data, showing detailed values to draw attention. Use different
  colors for the line representing the 1-year moving average to distinguish it from
  the actual data points. This visualization should help focus on trends and significant
  changes in the Dow Jones over the given periods, aiding in understanding historical
  market performance. Consider adding highlights to critical peaks and lowest points
  for enhanced clarity and immediate comprehension.

  styling?
