initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot for the ''Video Game Sales Dataset Updated
  - Extra Feat'' with ''Critic_Score'' on the x-axis and ''Global_Sales'' on the y-axis.
  Each point should represent a video game. Use different colors to distinguish between
  genres and different marker shapes to identify platforms. Make sure to label the
  axes and include a legend to explain the colors and shapes. Add a title to the scatter
  plot: "Critic Scores vs Global Sales by Genre and Platform." Your data can have
  missing values, so handle them accordingly in the plot.'

  between genres?
