initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization for the "Video Game Sales Dataset Updated
  - Extra Feat." The treemap should illustrate the distribution of global sales across
  different genres. Each genre should be divided into subcategories representing different
  publishers, and the size of each block should correspond to the global sales figures.
  Additionally, color-code the blocks based on the platform. Make sure to include
  tooltips that display the game name, year of release, and sales data for each segment
  when hovered over, for more detailed insights.

  platforms?

  3. Would you like labels to be displayed within each block, and if so, what information
  should they include?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels?

  6. Are there any specific size constraints or aspect ratios for the treemap?

  9. Should games be grouped or separated by specific criteria within each publisher
  block?'
