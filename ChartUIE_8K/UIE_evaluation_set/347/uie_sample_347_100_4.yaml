initial_prompt: Please create a series of box plots to visualize the distribution
  of global video game sales across different platforms (like Wii, NES, etc.) and
  genres. The charts should include key metrics such as NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales,
  and Critic Scores to show spread and outliers. Ensure to handle missing values appropriately,
  highlight significant outliers, and label each box plot clearly with the platform
  and genre. This analysis will help understand the performance variation in different
  markets and the critical reception of games over different platforms and genres.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different platforms and
  genres?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the orientation of the box plots (vertical
  or horizontal)?

  3. Would you like each platform and genre to be displayed on separate charts or
  combined in a single chart?

  4. Should the outliers be labeled individually, or would you prefer a general highlight?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like missing values to be treated (e.g., ignored,
  filled with a certain value)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Is there a particular order you would like the platforms and genres to be displayed
  in?

  8. Do you want any additional metrics or summaries to be included in the chart?'
