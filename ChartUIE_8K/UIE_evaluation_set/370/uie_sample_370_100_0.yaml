initial_prompt: 'Create a radar chart visualizing students'' grades over 12 months.
  Include the following people: James, Michael, Elizabeth, Paul, and Ashley. Use text
  annotations to highlight the top score for each student. Add highlights to emphasize
  key differences. The chart should present an educational overview, helping to identify
  trends in students’ performance throughout the year. It should serve teachers or
