initial_prompt: Create a line chart that illustrates students' grades over the year
  for James, Michael, Elizabeth, Paul, and Ashley. Highlight noticeable trends and
  fluctuations in each student's performance using different colors and line styles.
  Incorporate text annotations for significant data points, particularly those where
  there are highs or lows for each student, to draw attention to these key moments.
  The purpose is to easily compare the progression and variation of the grades within
  the academic year, which can help in assessing each student's overall performance
  and identifying areas needing improvement. Ensure the chart is easy to read and
  interpret, with a clear legend.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing each student''s
  performance?

  2. Are there specific line styles you would like to use for each student (e.g.,
  solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for text annotations?

  4. Do you want specific markers for significant data points (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  5. How detailed should the legend be, and where would you like it positioned on
  the chart?

  6. Should the x-axis (months) have any specific formatting or labeling preferences?

  7. Do you prefer a title or subtitle for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Are there any specific themes or design elements you would like incorporated
  to make the chart more visually appealing to the audience?'
