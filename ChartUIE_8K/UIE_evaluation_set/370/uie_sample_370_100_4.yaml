initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the students' grades over the
  year for James, Michael, Elizabeth, Paul, and Ashley. The x-axis should represent
  the months, and the y-axis should show the grades. Each student's grades should
  be represented as separate box plots to analyze the distribution and variability
  of their performance over time. Make sure to label the axes appropriately and include
  a legend to differentiate each student. This will help in understanding the trends
  and inconsistencies in their academic performances across the year.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box plots for each
  student?

  2. Would you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  colorful, academic)?

  3. Are there any specific gridline settings that you prefer (e.g., major and minor
  gridlines, only major gridlines)?

  4. Do you have any font preferences for the axis labels, title, and legend?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?

  6. Should the legend be placed at a specific location on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  7. Do you want to indicate any specific points or thresholds on the chart (e.g.,
  pass mark line)?

  8. How would you like the months to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., full month
  names, abbreviations)?

  9. Is there a particular order in which the students'' box plots should be displayed?'
