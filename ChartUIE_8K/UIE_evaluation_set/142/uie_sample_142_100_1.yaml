initial_prompt: Create a dumbbell chart visualizing the ages of candidates from Telangana
  contesting in the General Election 2019, highlighting the gender difference between
  candidates. Use "NAME" for labeling each candidate on the y-axis, "AGE" for the
  x-axis, and differentiate genders by color-coding data points. Include annotations
  showing asset values beside each candidate's name, emphasizing financial standing.

  their financial background. Highlight the winning candidate prominently.
