initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the comparison of total votes
  received by each candidate in the Telangana constituency for the 2019 Indian General
  Election. Each group should represent a candidate, and the bars within the group
  should display the general votes and postal votes they received. Include labels
  for candidate names and their parties. This will help in analyzing the distribution
  of votes among different candidates in the same constituency. Use different colors
  for general and postal votes bars. Provide a clear legend for the chart. Ensure
  the y-axis represents the number of votes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used for general
  votes and postal votes bars?

  2. Would you like the candidate names to be displayed in a particular font or style?

  3. Do you prefer the bars within each group to be spaced closely together or with
  some separation?

  4. Should the chart include the exact number of votes on top of each bar?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the overall color scheme or background
  color of the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any additional information or annotations on the chart,
  such as the total votes received by each candidate?

  7. Is there a particular orientation (horizontal or vertical) that you prefer for
  the grouped bar chart?

  8. Do you want to set a specific range for the y-axis or to let it auto-adjust based
  on the data?

  9. Do you prefer any specific style for the legend, such as its position (top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and
