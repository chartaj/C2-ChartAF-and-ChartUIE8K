initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between candidates'
  ages and the total votes they received in the 2019 Indian General Election. Use
  'AGE' on the x-axis and 'TOTAL VOTES' on the y-axis. Differentiate data points by
  the 'PARTY' they belong to using different colors. Ensure that the scatter plot
  also highlights which candidates have criminal cases against them by using marker
  shapes. Scatter plot should be interactive, showing candidate 'NAME' and 'PARTY'
  on hover. This will help in analyzing any patterns based on age, votes, and parties.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to differentiate
  between parties?

  2. Would you like a specific shape for candidates with criminal cases, or are default
  shapes acceptable (e.g., circles and triangles)?

  3. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  4. Are there any particular axis labels or formatting that you prefer (e.g., font
  size, style)?

  5. Do you need a legend for the colors and marker shapes, and if so, where would
  you prefer it to be located (e.g., right, top, bottom)?

  6. Is there a specific range that you would like the x-axis (AGE) and y-axis (TOTAL
  VOTES) to cover, or should it be automatically determined by the data?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the scatter plot for easier reference, and if so,
  any preferences on their appearance (e.g., color, style)?

  8. Do you prefer any specific styling for the data points (e.g., size, opacity)?

  9. Should we include any annotations or labels directly on the plot for specific
  candidates or data points of interest?'
