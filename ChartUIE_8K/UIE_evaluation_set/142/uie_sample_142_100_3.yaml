initial_prompt: I want to visualize the candidate data from the Indian General Election
  2019 using a heatmap. Please create a heatmap that shows the correlation between
  candidates' age, the number of criminal cases they have, and the total votes received
  (both general and postal votes). The heatmap should clearly demonstrate the relationship
  between these variables across different states and constituencies. Ensure that
  categories like PARTY, GENDER, and EDUCATION are also included in the heatmap to
  show how these factors might influence the other variables. Use color gradients
  to highlight higher and lower values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display specific numerical values within the cells?

  3. Do you want to include any specific labels or annotations in the heatmap?

  4. Is there a particular order in which you want the variables to be arranged or
  grouped?

  5. Would you like the gradients to be represented in a specific color scale (e.g.,
  blue to red, green to yellow)?

  6. How many levels of color intensity do you prefer for highlighting different values
  in the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  8. Is there a specific theme or style you would like the heatmap to follow (e.g.,
  minimalistic, detailed, colorful)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap.

  2. Yes, the heatmap should display specific numerical values within the cells.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference for the arrangement or grouping of the variables.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure about the number of levels of color intensity.

  7. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend to explain the color gradients.

  8. I do not have a specific theme or style in mind for the heatmap.'
