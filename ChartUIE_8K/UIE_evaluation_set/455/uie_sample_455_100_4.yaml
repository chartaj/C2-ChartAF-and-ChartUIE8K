initial_prompt: I have a dataset that includes various metrics for countries such
  as life expectancy, population, GDP per capita, and other identifiers like ISO codes.
  The data also includes continental information and is specifically for the year
  2007. I want to create a geographic heatmap that showcases the GDP per capita across
  different countries. The heatmap should help visualize how GDP per capita varies
  globally. Please make sure that each country is color-coded based on its GDP per
  capita, with a legend to indicate the scale. Include country borders and ensure
  all continents are visible.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap scale?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color gradient (e.g., blue to red, green to yellow)
  for visualizing GDP per capita?

  3. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  4. Do you want labels for countries shown on the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include additional information or annotations on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?'
