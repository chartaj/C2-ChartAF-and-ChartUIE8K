initial_prompt: Create a line chart tracking life expectancy over time for various
  countries, grouped by continent. Annotate key data points, such as highest and lowest
  life expectancy. Use different colors to highlight different continents. Add descriptive
  text annotations for notable countries or years to provide context. Emphasize trends
  and outliers. Ensure the chart is user-friendly for social science research, making
  it easy to compare life expectancy trends across continents and identify significant
  patterns. Keep the visual clear and informative.
