initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Iris Flower Dataset. Plot sepal_length
  on the x-axis and sepal_width on the y-axis. Use different colors to represent the
  three species. Highlight and annotate a few key data points to draw attention to
  specific sepal lengths and widths that stand out. The chart should help in visually
  distinguishing the variations between the Iris species based on their sepal dimensions.
  Highlighting certain points will help focus the viewer's attention on unique or
  significant measurements before they look at others. This visualization will help
  in understanding the distribution and relationship between sepal characteristics
  among Iris species.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for representing the three species?

  2. Do you have any specific sepal length and width data points that you want to
  be highlighted and annotated?

  3. Would you like the axis labels to include units or any specific text formatting?

  4. Is there a particular style or format for the annotations that you prefer (e.g.,
  font size, color, or background)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or design elements (e.g.,
  grid lines, background color) of the scatter plot?

  6. Should the plot include legends, and if so, do you have any specific preferences
  for their placement and appearance?

  7. Is there a preferred title or any additional text you would like to include in
  the scatter plot?

  8. Would you like the data points to have specific shapes or sizes based on certain
  criteria?'
