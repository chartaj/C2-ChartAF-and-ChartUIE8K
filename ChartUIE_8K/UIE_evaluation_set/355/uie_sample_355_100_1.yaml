initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of sepal lengths
  from the Iris Flower Dataset. Highlight the bins that contain sepal lengths of Iris-setosa
  species to distinguish them from other species. Include annotations for the mean
  and median sepal length values. Ensure the histogram bars for different species
  are color-coded for clear differentiation. The visualization aims to provide a clear
  understanding of sepal length distribution across different Iris species, which
  is essential for biological studies related to plant morphology. Apply text annotations
  to draw attention to key statistical metrics. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  species in the histogram?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use to highlight the bins containing
  sepal lengths of Iris-setosa?

  3. How would you like the mean and median sepal length values annotated on the chart
  (e.g., with lines, markers, specific colors)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific range or bin size for the sepal length values in the
  histogram?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations on the histogram?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the title and labels of the axes?

  7. Are there any additional statistical metrics or visual elements you would like
  to include in the histogram?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  species in the histogram.

  2. I am not sure about the specific colors to use for highlighting the bins containing
  sepal lengths of Iris-setosa.

  3. Lines with specific colors for the mean and median values would be great.

  4. I have no specific preference for the range or bin size for the sepal length
  values in the histogram.

  5. I am not sure about the font style or size for the text annotations.

  6. Please use clear and descriptive titles and labels for the axes.

  7. I do not know if I need additional statistical metrics or visual elements in
  the histogram.'
