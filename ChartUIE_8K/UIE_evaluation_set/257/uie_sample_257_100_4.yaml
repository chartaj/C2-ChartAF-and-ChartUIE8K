initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of key blood count
  metrics among COVID-19 patients. Use the columns "Red blood cell distribution width,"
  "Monocytes(%)," "White blood cell count," "Platelet Count," "Lymphocyte Count,"
  and "Neutrophils Count." Highlight differences across gender and recovery outcomes
  ("Outcome"). Ensure the chart effectively compares these metrics for "Male" vs.
  "Female" and "Recovered" vs. "Not Recovered." Title the chart "CBC Metrics Distribution
  in COVID-19 Patients." Labels should be clear and colors distinct. This will help
  in understanding variations in blood counts related to patient demographics and
  recovery outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred ordering for the categories ("Male", "Female",
  "Recovered", "Not Recovered") on the x-axis?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for each category?

  3. Would you prefer the box plots to be side-by-side for each metric or stacked
  vertically?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style and size of the chart''s title?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the labels and
  axis titles?

  6. Should the outliers be marked distinctly in the box plots? If yes, do you want
  a specific marker style?

  7. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability? If yes, should
  they be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to distinguish between different categories?
  If yes, where should it be positioned on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific statistical measures (like mean or median) you want to
  include as annotations on the box plots?

  10. Should the chart have a specific background color or be transparent?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the ordering for the categories.

  2. I have no specific preference for colors.

  3. I would prefer the box plots to be side-by-side for each metric.

  4. I have no specific preference for the style and size of the chart''s title.

  5. I am not sure about the font styles or sizes for the labels and axis titles.

  6. Yes, please mark the outliers distinctly in the box plots, but I do not have
  a specific marker style in mind.

  7. Yes, I would prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability, both horizontal
  and vertical.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to distinguish between different categories. I do
  not have a preferred position for it.

  9. Yes, please include the median as annotations on the box plots.

  10. I have no specific preference for the background color.'
