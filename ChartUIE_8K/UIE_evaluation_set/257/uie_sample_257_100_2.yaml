initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the average values of "Red blood
  cell distribution width", "Monocytes(%)", "White blood cell count", "Platelet Count",
  "Lymphocyte Count", and "Neutrophils Count" for patients who recovered vs. those
  not recovered. Highlight differences in these metrics between the two outcomes.
  Add annotations to the bars indicating the precise average values. The chart should
  help identify key blood count differences correlating with recovery outcomes for
  COVID-19 patients.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing the
  different outcomes?

  2. Would you like the bars to be labeled with both percentages and actual values,
  or just actual values?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend specifying the outcome categories?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be visible on the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations on the
  bars?

  7. Should the averages be displayed as numbers with specific decimal places?

  8. Do you prefer any specific axis titles or overall chart title?

  9. Would you like to have error bars to represent variability in the averages?

  10. Is there any specific order you want for the attributes on the x-axis?'
