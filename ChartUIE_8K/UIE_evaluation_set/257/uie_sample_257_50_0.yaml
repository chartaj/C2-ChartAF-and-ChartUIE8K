initial_prompt: Create a Heatmap visualizing the relationships between CBC parameters
  and patient outcomes. Highlight critical values and use text annotations to emphasize
  significant data points. This will help in understanding how blood cell counts affect
  COVID-19 recovery rates.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color coding?

  3. Are there specific CBC parameter ranges you consider critical and want highlighted?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  5. Do you prefer the heatmap to display hierarchical clustering for better correlation
  visualization?

  6. Should the heatmap include axis labels and titles for clarity?

  7. Would you like to include any additional statistical information (e.g., p-values,
  correlation coefficients) on the heatmap?'
