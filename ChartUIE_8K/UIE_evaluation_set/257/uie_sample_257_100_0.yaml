initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the complete blood count (CBC) data
  for COVID-19 patients. Highlight important columns such as 'Red blood cell distribution
  width', 'Monocytes(%)', 'White blood cell count', 'Platelet Count', 'Lymphocyte
  Count', and 'Neutrophils Count'. Use annotations to display key statistics and provide
  context about patient outcomes (Recovered/Not Recovered) and treatments received.
  Aim to show relationships between different blood counts and patient outcomes. Make
  sure to emphasize any significant correlations. The goal is to provide a clear visual
  representation of the CBC variations among patients and their health outcomes.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for distinguishing different ranges
  of blood counts and outcomes?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display a gradient scale bar for representing the
  values?

  3. Do you prefer any specific annotation style or format for displaying key statistics
  and patient outcomes?

  4. Should the heatmap include labels for the individual data points?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation (horizontal/vertical)
  of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the correlation or significance
  levels?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds or ranges for the CBC values that you would
  like to emphasize?

  8. Should the heatmap include gridlines between the cells for better readability?'
