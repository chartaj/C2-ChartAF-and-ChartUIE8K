initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing Patient Age vs. White blood cell count

  5. How would you like the line styles to be represented for each gender (e.g., solid,
  dashed, dotted)?

  6. Do you want a legend to identify the genders and recovery outcomes, and if so,
  where should it be placed?

  7. Is there a specific range for the axes (Patient Age and White Blood Cell Count)
  that you would like to be set?

  8. Would you prefer to include data point markers on the line chart (e.g., circles,
  squares) to highlight individual data points?'
