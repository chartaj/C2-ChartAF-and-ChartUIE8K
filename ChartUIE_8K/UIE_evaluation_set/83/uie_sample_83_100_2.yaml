initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualization for the Online Food Dataset
  that reflects insights from the data provided. Specifically, I would like to see
  how monthly income is distributed across different age groups and educational qualifications.
  Highlight the median income for each group clearly. Add annotations to highlight
  key data points like the average monthly income within these groups and any outliers.
  Additionally, ensure that the chart has a legend that explains these annotations.
  Use the latitude and longitude data to group information by region if possible.
  This will help in understanding regional income variations. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different age groups and
  educational qualifications in the box plot?

  2. Is there a specific format or style you would like for the median income line
  in the box plot?

  3. What specific annotations style do you prefer for highlighting key data points
  such as average incomes and outliers?

  4. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend on the chart?

  5. Are there any particular fonts or text sizes you would like for the chart labels,
  titles, or annotations?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Are there specific regions (based on latitude and longitude) you would like to
  focus on or exclude from the analysis?

  8. Is there any specific way you would like the data to be grouped by region (e.g.,
  by states, countries, or manual grouping)?
