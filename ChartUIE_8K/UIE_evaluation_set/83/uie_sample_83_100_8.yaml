initial_prompt: Please create a funnel and pyramid chart to visualize the Online Food
  Dataset. The funnel chart should show the distribution of different age groups progressing
  through various stages of ordering food online. Meanwhile, the pyramid chart should
  highlight the comparison between male and female users in terms of their monthly
  income brackets. Use Age, Gender, Monthly Income, and Output fields to create these
  charts. The charts should aid in understanding user demographics and their impact
  on online food ordering trends, leveraging multi-level data segmentation effectively.
