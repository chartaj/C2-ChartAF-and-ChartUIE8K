initial_prompt: I want to see a bar chart that shows the number of people in each
  age group from the given dataset. The age groups should be 18-25, 26-35, 36-45,
  and 46+. Additionally, I want to see separate sets of bars for males and females
  within each age group to compare the distribution of gender across different age
  ranges. Use different colors for males and females for clear distinction. Include
  axis labels, legends, and a title. Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret
  with clear differentiation between gender categories.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for males and females?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the legends be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a preferred way you want the age groups to be labeled on the x-axis?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or information you would like to include
  on the chart?'
