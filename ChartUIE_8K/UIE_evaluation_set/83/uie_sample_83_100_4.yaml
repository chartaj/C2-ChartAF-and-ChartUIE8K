initial_prompt: I want a Choropleth map visualizing the distribution of monthly income
  levels in various regions from the dataset. The map should show different colors
  indicating different levels of income at various latitudes and longitudes. Each
  pin code area should be color-coded based on the most common income level category
  found there. Additionally, include any patterns related to age, gender, or family
  size if possible. Please highlight the regions with highest and lowest income levels
  distinctly. The map should be interactive, allowing users to hover for additional
  details such as educational qualifications and feedback.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for indicating different\
  \ levels of income on the map?\n2. What color would you like to use to distinctly\
  \ highlight the regions with the highest income levels?\n3. What color would you\
  \ like to use to distinctly highlight the regions with the lowest income levels?\n\
  4. Do you prefer using a specific color palette for age, gender, or family size\
  \ patterns?\n5. How many income level categories would you like to display on the\
  \ map?\n6. Would you like any specific background or boundary styles for the map?\
  \ \n7. Is there a preferred map projection type for the Choropleth map?"
