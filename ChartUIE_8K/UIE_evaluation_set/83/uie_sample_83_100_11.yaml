initial_prompt: I'd like to create a bubble chart using the data from the provided
  Online Food Dataset. The chart should display 'Age' on the x-axis and 'Monthly Income'
  on the y-axis. Each bubble should represent a data point with its size proportional
  to the 'Family size' of the individual. The bubbles should be color-coded based
  on 'Gender'. This way, I can understand how age, income, and family size interact,
  and observe any possible patterns or trends. Additionally, it would be helpful if
  the chart includes a legend to differentiate between genders.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the gender categories?

  2. Would you like to customize the size range of the bubbles?

  3. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  4. Are there any specific labels you would like to use for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferred font size or style for the labels and title?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for their style?

  7. Do you prefer any particular scale (linear, logarithmic, etc.) for the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  8. Are there any specific ranges you would like to set for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend on the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the chart?'
