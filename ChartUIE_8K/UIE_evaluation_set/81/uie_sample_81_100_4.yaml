initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of YouTube video
  views for the top channels. Use the "video views" data from "../Extra_datas/data/81.csv".
  The X-axis should represent the range of video views in bins (e.g., 0-50M, 50M-100M,
  etc.), and the Y-axis should represent the count of channels within each bin. This
  will help analyze how many channels fall within each range of total video views.
  Title the chart "Distribution of YouTube Video Views - Top Channels 2023" to reflect
  the global statistics for the current year.
