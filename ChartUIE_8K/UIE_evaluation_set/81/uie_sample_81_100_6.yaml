initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trend of the "subscribers" and
  "video views for the last 30 days" over time for the top three YouTubers. Use data
  from the "created_year", "created_month", and "created_date" to plot the time axis.
  The main focus should be on examining how subscriber growth and recent video views
  evolve, highlighting differences between these top YouTubers. Mark significant events,
  if any, along the timeline. Ensure that the lines for "subscribers" and "video views
  for the last 30 days" are clearly distinguishable using different colors and markers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the lines
  representing "subscribers" and "video views for the last 30 days"?

  2. Do you have a preference for the type of markers to use for distinguishing the
  lines (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  3. Are there particular significant events or dates you want to highlight on the
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or text you would like to include on the
  chart?

  6. Would you like to see a legend in a specific location on the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, colorful, professional)?

  8. Is there a specific date format you would like to use for the time axis labels?

  9. Do you have a preference for the range or scaling used on the vertical axes (subscribers
  and video views)?'
