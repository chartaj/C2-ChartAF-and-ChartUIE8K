initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 YouTube channels by subscribers.
  Use the 'Youtuber' names for the x-axis and the number of 'subscribers' for the
  y-axis. Ensure the chart is sorted in descending order. Add data labels to show
  exact subscriber counts. Title the chart "Top 10 YouTube Channels by Subscribers
  in 2023." Add colors to distinguish different categories such as 'Music', 'Film
  & Animation', and 'Entertainment.' Include a legend to indicate categories. Make
  sure the chart is clear and concise for presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used for different
  categories?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the chart title and labels?

  3. Do you want gridlines in the background of the chart? If yes, should they be
  major, minor, or both?

  4. Would you prefer the data labels to be inside or outside the bar charts?

  5. Are there any specific dimensions for the chart (height and width) for your presentation?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for the numbers on the y-axis (e.g., commas for
  thousands, millions)?

  8. Do you have any preferred styling for the bars (e.g., border color, border width)?
