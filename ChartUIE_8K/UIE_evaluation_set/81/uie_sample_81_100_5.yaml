initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart for "Global YouTube Statistics 2023". Visualize
  the top 3 YouTubers by "subscribers" and "video views". Split the bars by "Country"
  and "channel_type" to show subscriber distribution and video views. Include "uploads"
  and "subscribers_for_last_30_days" as additional layers in the stack. Make sure
  to highlight "Music", "Games", "Entertainment" categories distinctively. Use contrasting
  colors and a clear legend for easy understanding. Include titles and labels to make
  the information clear. Ensure the chart is visually appealing and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for highlighting the "Music",
  "Games", and "Entertainment" categories?

  2. How would you like the legend to be positioned in the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  3. Do you have any preference for the chart''s title font and size?

  4. What labels and axis titles would you like to include for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Should the data values be displayed on the bars?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like to stack the additional layers
  ("uploads" and "subscribers_for_last_30_days")?

  7. Do you have a preferred background color for the chart?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be included or excluded in the chart? If included,
  do you have any preferences for their style (e.g., dashed, solid)?'

  colors to make them distinct.

  2. I do not know, you can decide where to place the legend.

  3. I have no specific preference for the title font and size.

  be labeled with "Count".
