initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset from ''Global Electricity Access: Country-Level
  Analysis'' which includes country names, codes, years, and the percentage of the
  population with access to electricity. Specifically, I want to create a scatter
  plot that shows the trend of electricity access over time. On the x-axis, plot the
  years, and on the y-axis, plot the percentage of the population with access to electricity.
  Use different colors or markers to represent different countries. Make sure to handle
  missing values appropriately. This will help in visualizing how access to electricity
  has changed globally across years.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for different countries?

  2. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or focus on?

  3. Would you like to display data points for every year, or should some years be
  aggregated?

  4. How would you like to handle missing values in the dataset?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the marker shapes used for different countries?

  6. Would you like to add trend lines for each country to show the overall direction
  of change over time?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the labels and legend?

  8. Should any additional information be included in tooltips when hovering over
  the data points?

  9. Do you require a title or subtitle for the scatter plot? If so, what should it
  be?

  10. Would you like any reference lines or bands to highlight specific milestones
  or thresholds in electricity access?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like to display data points for every year.

  4. Handle missing values by either interpolating or omitting those points.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please add trend lines for each country.

  7. No specific preference for the font or style.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, the title should be "Global Electricity Access Over Time" and no subtitle
  is needed.

  10. I do not know.'
