initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing access to electricity across different
  countries over the years. Highlight countries with access below 10% to emphasize
  low access areas. Annotations should mark years where significant changes occurred.
  The purpose is to show the global progress and identify regions lagging in electricity
  access. A visual comparison over the years will help understand trends and regional
  disparities, aiding in energy policy and investment decisions. Ensure the heatmap
  is color-coded from red to green, where red denotes lower access and green denotes
  higher access.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred size or dimensions for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific type of annotation (e.g., text, markers) for marking
  significant changes?

  3. Do you have specific years or time intervals in mind for highlighting changes?

  4. Do you have any preference for the color scale or intensity levels between red
  and green?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color coding?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations and axis labels?

  7. Would you like gridlines or separators between years or countries on the heatmap?

  8. Should the heatmap focus on certain regions or show all countries globally?

  9. Do you require specific labels for countries with access below 10%, or would
  a highlight suffice?

  10. Should the heatmap include any additional contextual information, such as global
  averages or benchmarks?'
