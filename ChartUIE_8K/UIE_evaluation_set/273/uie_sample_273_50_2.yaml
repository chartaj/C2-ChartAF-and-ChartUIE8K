initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing year-on-year access to electricity
  for different countries. Highlight discrepancies and use text annotations for notable
  outliers. Focus on trends and variations to analyze global electricity access patterns.
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box chart to\
  \ differentiate between countries or regions?\n2. Would you prefer the chart to\
  \ be oriented vertically or horizontally?\n3. Are there any specific countries or\
  \ regions you want to be particularly highlighted?\n4. Do you have a preference\
  \ for the style and position of text annotations for notable outliers?\n5. Should\
  \ the chart include a legend to indicate different countries?\n6. Would you like\
  \ to include grid lines to improve readability of trends and variations?\n7. Do\
  \ you prefer the chart to display median values, quartiles, and outliers separately?\n\
  8. Would you like to have a title and axis labels to describe the data visualized?\n\
  9. Do you want the chart to show individual data points along with the box plots?\
  \ \n10. Are there any specific time periods you are most interested in focusing\
  \ on?"
