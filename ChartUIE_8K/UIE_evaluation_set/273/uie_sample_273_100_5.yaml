initial_prompt: Using the provided dataset on global electricity access, I would like
  a line chart showing the percentage of the population with access to electricity
  over time for different countries. Please plot the years on the x-axis and the percentage
  of the population with electricity on the y-axis. Different lines should represent
  different countries color-coded for clarity. Focus on countries with significant
  changes or trends in electricity access. Include a legend and ensure the chart is
  easily readable. This will help visualize how electricity access has improved or
  stagnated globally over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the lines representing
  different countries?

  2. Would you prefer a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific countries you want to include or exclude in the chart?

  6. Should the y-axis be set to a fixed range or should it adjust automatically based
  on the data?

  7. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right, or outside the chart)?

  8. Do you want data points to be highlighted or marked on the lines for each year?

  9. Would you like any annotations or callouts for significant changes or trends
  in the chart?

  10. Is there a specific style (e.g., dashed or solid) you want for the lines representing
  the countries?'
