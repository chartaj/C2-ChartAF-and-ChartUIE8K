initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing global electricity access rates by country
  over time. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight countries with the highest
  and lowest access percentages. Make sure to use color gradients effectively to distinguish
  between different levels of access.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap (e.g., specific
  colors for representing low, medium, and high access rates)?

  2. Should the heatmap display years in a specific interval (e.g., annually, every
  5 years)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should there be a legend explicitly showing the color gradient and corresponding
  values?

  5. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the heatmap? If so, please
  provide the preferred text.

  6. Do you want gridlines to be visible in the heatmap for easier reference?

  7. Should the heatmap include any additional labels or markers aside from the text
  annotations for extreme values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Annually.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, there should be a legend explicitly showing the color gradient and corresponding
  values.

  5. Title: "Global Electricity Access Rates by Country Over Time"

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I am not sure.'
