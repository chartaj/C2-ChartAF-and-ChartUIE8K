initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the "Access to electricity
  (% of population)" over the years for Afghanistan using the provided dataset. This
  chart should show how electricity access has evolved from 2000 to 2002. Make sure
  to label the x-axis with years and the y-axis with the percentage of the population
  that has access to electricity. Additionally, color the bars to differentiate each
  year clearly. This visualization will help understand the trend in electricity access
  for Afghanistan during these years.
