initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between
  Product Price (on the x-axis) and Rating (on the y-axis) from the Jumia Prices and
  Ratings for all Products 2024 dataset. Use the summarized data columns to plot this
  information. Plot Price against Rating, making sure to handle the 'EGP' currency
