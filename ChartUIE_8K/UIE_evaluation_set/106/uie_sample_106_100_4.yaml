initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the average product rating by product
  category from the provided Jumia Prices and Ratings 2024 data. Ensure the x-axis
  represents different product categories and the y-axis shows the average ratings.
  Use the 'Product Name' to infer the category and 'Rating' to calculate the average
  rating for each category. Please make sure to handle any missing values appropriately
  in your calculations and provide a clear, labeled chart. This will help to compare
  the overall customer satisfaction across different product categories. Thank you!
