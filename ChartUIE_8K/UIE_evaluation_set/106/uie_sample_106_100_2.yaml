initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the price distribution for different
  products on Jumia in 2024. The chart should display "Product Name" on the x-axis
  and "Price" on the y-axis. Highlight extreme values in the box plot to easily identify
  price outliers. Use data annotations to indicate the average rating for each product,
  providing quick insights into both pricing and customer satisfaction. This will
  help in comparing product prices and understanding customer preferences at a glance.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret for business decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the extreme values to be highlighted in a specific color?

  3. Do you prefer specific styles or formats for the data annotations indicating
  average ratings?

  4. Should the average rating be displayed above or within the box plots?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the outliers to be represented (e.g.,
  different shapes or colors)?

  7. Should we include grid lines for better readability, and if so, what style do
  you prefer for them?

  8. Would you like to include a legend explaining the highlights and annotations?

  9. Do you have a preferred arrangement or order for the products on the x-axis?

  10. Are there any specific titles or captions you would like to add to the chart
  for clarity?'
