initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the missing values across different
  columns for the Jumia Prices and Ratings dataset. The heatmap should have columns
  labeled 'Product Name,' 'Price,' 'Details,' and 'Rating,' and use color intensity
  to indicate the number of missing values in each column. This will help us quickly
  identify which columns have the most missing data and focus our data cleaning efforts
  accordingly. Use the unique values in the heatmap to show data density across different
  categories. Ensure the heatmap is intuitive and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Should there be any specific labels or legends added to the heatmap for better
  interpretation?

  3. Do you prefer a sequential color gradient or diverging color gradient to represent
  the intensity of missing values?

  4. Would you like any annotations on the heatmap to display the exact number of
  missing values in each cell?

  5. Should the heatmap include a title and/or axis labels?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and titles?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a particular layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, a legend explaining the color intensity and missing values would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure.
