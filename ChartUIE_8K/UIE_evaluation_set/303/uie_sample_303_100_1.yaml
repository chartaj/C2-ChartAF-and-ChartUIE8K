initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the underwater video assessment
  data of benthic habitats around Puerto Rico. Map regions with different site types
  and assessment types, marking specific latitudes and longitudes. Use color highlights
  to indicate areas with varying degrees of coral presence, sand, and other habitat
  types. Incorporate text annotations to provide insights into specific data points,
  such as site IDs and collected dates. The aim is to visualize the distribution and
  density of different habitat types for environmental science purposes, making it
  easier to identify areas of interest for further ecological study.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting different
  habitat types (e.g., coral presence, sand)?

  2. Would you like to include a legend in the map to explain the color highlights?
  If so, where would you prefer the legend to be located?

  3. How detailed would you like the map to be regarding zoom levels and area coverage?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the map''s background (e.g., satellite imagery,
  plain color)?

  5. Are there any specific map annotation styles or formats (text size, font, etc.)
  you prefer for the site IDs and collected dates?

  6. Would you prefer the latitudes and longitudes to be marked with specific symbols
  or just indicated through text annotations? If symbols, do you have a preference
  for their appearance?

  7. Is there any additional information you would like to be displayed on the heatmap
  that is not mentioned in the initial instructions?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, include a legend. I don’t have a specific preference for its location.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I don’t have a specific preference.

  6. Just indicate latitudes and longitudes through text annotations.

  7. I am not sure.'
