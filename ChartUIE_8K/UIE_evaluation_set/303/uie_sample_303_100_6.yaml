initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the depth of underwater
  sites over time. The x-axis should represent the 'DATE COLLECTED' and 'TIME COLLECTED',
  and the y-axis should represent the 'DEPTH'. This visual representation can help
  us analyze how underwater topography varies on different dates and times. Each point's
  associated underwater video link should be made accessible by optionally clicking
  or hovering over the data points. This data visualization will help in the assessment
  and study of benthic habitats.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the line or data points?

  2. Would you like to differentiate data points by any specific feature such as color
  or shape?

  3. Do you prefer a specific date and time format for the x-axis labels?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines or any background reference lines?

  5. Should the chart include a legend or key, and if so, how would you like it to
  be positioned?

  6. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on significant data points?

  7. Do you have a preference for the style of the line (solid, dashed, etc.)?

  8. How would you like the tooltips to appear (e.g., include all data attributes,
  only specific ones)?

  9. Should there be any specific range or scale adjustments for the y-axis?

  10. Would you like to include titles for the axes and the chart, and if so, what
  should they be?'
