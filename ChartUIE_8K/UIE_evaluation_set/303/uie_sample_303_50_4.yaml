initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the relationship between LATITUDE,
  LONGITUDE, and DEPTH for different SITE TYPES. Include bubbles sized by DEPTH and
  colored by CORAL REEF presence.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for indicating the presence or
  absence of coral reefs?

  2. Should the size of the bubbles represent the absolute value of ''DEPTH'', considering
  it might be negative due to depth below sea level?

  3. Do you prefer any specific axis labels or titles for better clarity?

  4. Would you like any specific gridlines or background for easier readability?

  5. Do you have any preferences for bubble transparency or outline to better differentiate
  overlapping points?

  6. Should the ''SITE TYPE'' be displayed with specific markers or shapes within
  the bubble chart?

  7. Are there any annotation preferences for specific data points or clusters?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend that identifies coral reef presence
  and depth size?

  9. Should we include data labels on the bubbles or tooltips for a cleaner look?

  10. Any preferences for the range of the latitude or longitude axes for focusing
  on specific areas?'
