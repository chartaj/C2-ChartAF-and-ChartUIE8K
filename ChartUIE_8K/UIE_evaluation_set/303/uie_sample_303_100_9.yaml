initial_prompt: I need a parallel coordinates chart to visualize the underwater video
  assessment data of benthic habitats around the Puerto Rico region. The chart should
  include axes like SITE TYPE, ASSESSMENT TYPE, DATE COLLECTED, DEPTH, and various
  environmental features (CORAL REEF, PAVEMENT, RHODOLITH, etc.). Make sure to highlight
  relationships among different site types and assessment types. Also, show the presence
  or absence of features like coral reefs and sponges across sites. Ensure the chart
  is interactive, allowing for filtering and highlighting specific data dimensions.
  This visualization will help in understanding habitat conditions effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different environmental
  features or site types?

  2. Would you prefer the axes to be arranged in a specific order?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  4. Do you want any specific labels or legends included in the chart?

  5. Are there particular types of lines or markers you prefer to use for the data
  points?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the ranges or scales of the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences for different environmental
  features or site types.

  2. I do not know, maybe you can arrange the axes in a logical way that best represents
  the data.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for the size or aspect ratio of the chart.

  4. Yes, please include labels and legends to make the chart easy to understand.

  5. I am not sure about specific lines or markers; please use whatever makes the
  data clear and readable.

  6. I do not have any preferences for the ranges or scales of the axes.'
