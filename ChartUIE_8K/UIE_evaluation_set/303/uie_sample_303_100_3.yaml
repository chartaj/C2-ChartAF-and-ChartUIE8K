initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the presence of
  different underwater features (e.g., Coral Reef, Pavement, Rhodolith, Sand, Hard
  Coral, etc.) for each SITE ID. Use colors to differentiate between features like
  Present and Absent and group the same SITE TYPE together in the chart to observe
  the distribution. Make sure to label the x-axis with SITE IDs and the y-axis with
  the type of assessments carried out. Also, include a legend to distinguish between
  the different features.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer for differentiating between
  the features present and absent?

  2. Is there a particular order you would like to see the SITE IDs arranged in on
  the x-axis (e.g., chronological, alphabetical)?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the chart title or should we use a default
  title based on the data presented?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included in the chart
  for better clarity?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels,
  legend, and title?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout and design of the legend (e.g., position:
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for easier readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their style or color?

  8. Is there a particular design theme you would like the chart to adhere to (e.g.,
  minimalist, vibrant, professional)?

  9. Do you prefer a specific width and height for the chart?

  10. Would you like any additional elements or information to be included in the
  chart beyond what has been initially described?'
