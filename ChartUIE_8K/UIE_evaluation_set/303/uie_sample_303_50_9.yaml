initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart visualizing the benthic habitat
  data, specifically highlighting attributes like SITE TYPE, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE,
  DEPTH, CORAL REEF presence, and MACROALGAE presence from the CSV file. Include all
  sample data for comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or themes for the chart?

  2. Do you want to use specific line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) to differentiate
  between attributes?

  3. Should we use specific markers or symbols for particular data points?

  4. How would you like missing data to be represented, if at all?

  5. Do you want to include axis labels and titles? If yes, any specific preferences
  for their format or placement?

  6. Should we apply any filtering or normalization to any of the attributes (e.g.,
  normalizing depth values)?

  7. Is there any specific way you would like to handle overlapping lines for better
  visual clarity?

  8. Would you prefer particular fonts or font sizes for labels and titles?

  9. Do you want to add legends or annotations? If yes, any specific preferences on
  their design?

  10. Are there specific ranges for any attributes that you want to focus on or highlight
  further?'
