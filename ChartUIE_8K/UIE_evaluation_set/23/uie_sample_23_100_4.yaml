initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for visualizing the relationship between car
  price and various factors in the US Cars Dataset. Focus on variables like brand,
  model, year, title_status, mileage, color, state, and condition. The heatmap should
  highlight areas with high and low car prices, making it easy to identify patterns
  or correlations. Ensure the heatmap is clear and easy to read, with proper labels
  for all axes and a color legend to indicate price ranges. This will help to understand
  how different factors impact car pricing in the automotive market.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for the
  heatmap?

  2. Are there any particular axis labels or titles you would prefer for the heatmap?

  3. Do you wish to include any annotations or specific markers on the heatmap?

  4. Is there a preferred ordering for the categorical variables (e.g., brand, model,
  state) on the axes?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for the price that you want to highlight
  with distinct color gradients?

  6. Do you need the heatmap to show only specific variables among ''brand'', ''model'',
  ''year'', ''title_status'', ''mileage'', ''color'', ''state'', and ''condition'',
  or should it include all specified variables?

  7. Would you like to include any form of data aggregation or smoothing to enhance
  readability, e.g., averaging prices over certain year ranges or mileage brackets?'
