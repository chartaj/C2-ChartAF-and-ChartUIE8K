initial_prompt: I'd like to see a histogram that showcases the distribution of car
  prices from the dataset. The x-axis should display price ranges while the y-axis
  should show the count of cars within each range. Use distinct colors to represent
  different price intervals. Aim for clear labels for both axes to make interpreting
  the histogram easier. Additionally, if possible, include a secondary histogram within
  the same graph that shows mileage distribution using the same car data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the different price
  intervals?

  2. How many price intervals would you prefer for the histogram?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the bin size of the histograms?

  4. Would you like the secondary histogram (mileage distribution) to use the same
  color scheme as the price intervals or a different one?

  5. Do you prefer the histograms to be overlaid on the same graph or placed side-by-side?

  6. Are there any specific price and mileage ranges you are particularly interested
  in highlighting?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the histogram?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like included in the
  histogram?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the font type and size for the axis labels and
  title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer a moderate bin size, not too small but not too large either.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I prefer the histograms to be overlaid on the same graph.

  6. I do not have any specific ranges to highlight.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
