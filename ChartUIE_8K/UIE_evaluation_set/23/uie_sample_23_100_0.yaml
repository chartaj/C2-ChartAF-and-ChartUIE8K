initial_prompt: Visualize the US Cars Dataset with a Choropleth map to show the average
  car prices across different states. Annotate key states with the highest and lowest
  average prices to highlight significant regions. Additionally, use text annotations
  to provide context for extreme values. Highlight states with dense populations or
  significant car markets to emphasize their importance. Ensure the map clearly distinguishes
  between states using color gradients. The map should help users quickly identify
  price trends and market differences across the country. This visualization will
  aid in understanding geographic pricing patterns in the US automobile market.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for distinguishing
  between states?

  2. What particular font style and size would you prefer for the annotations?

  3. Should the text annotations for extreme values be positioned in a specific way
  relative to the states?

  4. Would you like borders or outlines around the states for better differentiation?
  If so, what color and thickness?

  5. How would you like the dense population or significant car market states to be
  highlighted (e.g., with a different color, border, or shading)?

  6. Is there a preferred scale or range for the price values on the map?

  7. Do you have preferences for the overall layout, such as map size and aspect ratio?

  8. Are there any specific labeling requirements for the key states with the highest
  and lowest prices?

  9. Would you like a legend to explain the color gradients? If so, do you have preferences
  for its location and design?

  10. Do you want to incorporate any additional data layers, such as population density,
  directly on the map?'
