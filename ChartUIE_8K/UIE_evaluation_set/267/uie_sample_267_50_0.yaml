initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the frequency of 'Faulty Steel Plates'
  from the dataset. Highlight specific fault types, and annotate the highest frequency
  categories for attention. Use colors to make distinctions clear and engaging.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  different fault types?

  2. Should the fault types be ordered in a specific way (e.g., descending frequency)?

  3. Do you have specific labels or annotations that you want for the highest frequency
  categories?

  4. How detailed would you like the annotations to be for the highlighted categories?

  5. Should the histogram include a legend explaining the colors associated with each
  fault type?

  6. What font style and size would you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Do you have a preferred format for displaying the frequency values (e.g., absolute
  numbers, percentages)?

  8. Should the X and Y axes have specific titles or labels?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be included in the histogram? If so, in which orientation
  (horizontal, vertical, both)?

  10. Are there any specific aspects of the design (layout, spacing, etc.) that you
  want to emphasize?'
