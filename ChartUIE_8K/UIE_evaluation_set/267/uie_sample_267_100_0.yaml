initial_prompt: Visualize a histogram showing the distribution of Pixel Areas for
  faulty steel plates. Annotate specific points to highlight plates with high pixel
  areas. Use highlights to differentiate between types of steel (A300 and A400). Also,
  add text annotations for outliers in the Sum of Luminosity to draw attention to
  unusual brightness. The goal is to easily identify any correlation between plate
  thickness and defects like Pastry, Stains, Dirtiness, and Bumps. This will aid urban
  planning in identifying patterns and problem areas in steel plate production quality.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram and highlights?

  2. How would you like the high pixel areas to be annotated (specific symbols or
  text)?

  3. Would you prefer the highlights for different types of steel to be shown in specific
  colors or shading patterns?

  4. Is there a particular font you prefer for text annotations on the histogram?

  5. How would you like the outliers in the Sum of Luminosity to be marked (e.g.,
  with special symbols or specific colors)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the histogram bins'' size or number?

  7. Would you prefer the histogram to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to explain the highlights and annotations?

  9. Are there any specific labels or titles you''d like on the chart?

  10. Would you like to include grid lines or any background patterns to enhance readability?'
answers: "1. I am not sure.\n2. Maybe using larger dots or bold text would be good.\n\
  3. Specific colors for A300 and A400 would be fine.\n4. I do not have a specific\
  \ preference. \n5. Special symbols like stars or a different color would be nice.\n\
  6. I am not sure.\n7. I do not know.\n8. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.\n\
  9. Title: \"Distribution of Pixel Areas for Faulty Steel Plates\" and labels like\
  \ \"Pixel Area\" and \"Frequency\".\n10. Yes, grid lines could help with readability."
