initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the Sum_of_Luminosity against
  the Y_Minimum for the detected faults in the steel plates. Ensure each fault type
  (e.g., Pastry, Z_Scratch) is represented with a different color line to differentiate
  between them. Additionally, include the Steel_Plate_Thickness as a secondary line
  to show its variation corresponding to the Y_Minimum. The X-axis should represent
  the Y_Minimum values, and the Y-axis should represent the Sum_of_Luminosity and
  Steel_Plate_Thickness. This will help analyze luminosity changes and thickness across
  different Y-coordinate placements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors representing different
  fault types?

  2. Do you prefer a particular style for the lines, such as solid, dashed, or dotted?

  3. Would you like to include any specific gridlines or markers on the chart?

  4. Should the secondary line for Steel_Plate_Thickness be plotted on a dual-axis
  (secondary Y-axis)?

  5. Is there a specific title or label format you would prefer for the axes and legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font type or size used in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or data labels on specific points in
  the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  9. Is there a preferred range or scale for the Y-axis (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  10. Do you want any specific interaction or tooltip information to be included when
  hovering over data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, the secondary line for Steel_Plate_Thickness should be plotted on a dual-axis
  (secondary Y-axis).

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, the chart should include a legend. I prefer it to be positioned at the top-right.

  9. Linear scale is preferred.

  10. I do not need any specific interaction or tooltip information.'
