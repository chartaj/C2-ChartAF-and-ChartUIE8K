initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between different
  features of the steel plate faults data. Highlight key areas, such as 'Steel_Plate_Thickness'
  vs 'Fault Types' (Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, etc.), to understand fault distribution
  across plate thicknesses. Include annotations to emphasize significant correlations
  and provide insights on any unique patterns observed. The heatmap should help in
  urban planning for identifying critical factors affecting steel plate quality, guiding
  process improvements. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret, focusing on practical
  applications in identifying and addressing faults.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for a specific color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a particular range of colors to indicate different correlation
  strengths?

  3. Do you have a preference for the scale type (linear or logarithmic) for the color
  mapping?

  4. Are there specific significance thresholds you''d like for annotations (e.g.,
  correlations above 0.8)?

  5. Would you prefer the annotations to show correlation values or just highlight
  significant correlations?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font size or style of the annotations?

  7. Should the heatmap include grid lines to separate the cells clearly?

  8. Would you like a specific ordering of the ''Fault Types'' on the heatmap, or
  should it be automatically determined by the data?

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to be accompanied by a legend explaining the color
  scale?

  10. Are there any specific patterns or insights you expect to be highlighted in
  the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I think significant correlations above 0.8 should be annotated.

  5. Just highlight significant correlations.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, the heatmap should include grid lines.

  8. No specific preference for the ordering of ''Fault Types''.

  9. Yes, include a legend explaining the color scale.

  10. I expect correlations between ''Steel_Plate_Thickness'' and different fault
  types to be highlighted.'
