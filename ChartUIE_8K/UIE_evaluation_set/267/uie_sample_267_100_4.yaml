initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  'Pixels_Areas' and 'Sum_of_Luminosity' for Faulty Steel Plates. Each point should
  represent a sample from the provided data. Use different markers or colors to distinguish
  between 'TypeOfSteel_A300' and 'TypeOfSteel_A400'. Include labels for the axes and
  a legend to explain the markers/colors. This will help in analyzing the luminosity
  in relation to defective areas for different steel types. Additionally, ensure the
  plot is clear and easy to interpret, as it will aid in urban-planning applications.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the markers representing ''TypeOfSteel_A300''
  and ''TypeOfSteel_A400''?

  2. Would you prefer specific marker shapes for ''TypeOfSteel_A300'' and ''TypeOfSteel_A400'',
  or should we use default shapes?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  5. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels
  and legend?

  6. Do you have any preference for the size of the scatter plot (e.g., dimensions
  in inches or pixels)?

  7. Should data points have a transparency effect (e.g., alpha blending) to emphasize
  the density of points?'
