initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various steel
  plate features (e.g., dimensions, luminosity, indices). Use text annotations for
  key insights. Highlight significant correlations to understand faulty steel plate
  patterns for urban planning applications.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific thresholds for highlighting significant correlations that
  you wish to set?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to include a legend for correlation values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for text annotations?

  5. Are there particular features or correlations you want to emphasize more prominently?

  6. Do you have a preferred orientation of the heatmap (e.g., horizontal, vertical)?

  7. Should the heatmap include grid lines to separate the cells?

  8. Do you want to include axis labels with detailed descriptions or just basic labels?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions for the heatmap that you prefer?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include a legend for correlation values.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I donâ€™t know.

  8. Basic labels are fine.

  9. I am not sure.'
