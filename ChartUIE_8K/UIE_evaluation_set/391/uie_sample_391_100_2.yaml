initial_prompt: Visualize the influencer network data with a donut chart to display
  follower distribution across different groups. Annotate key influencers with the
  highest and lowest followers for emphasis. Highlight Tech and Music groups using
  distinct colors to differentiate them. Highlight Bob and Charlie to show attention
  on key influencers. This chart helps in understanding group influence within media
  and communications, drawing attention to specific high-follower influencers for
  strategic decisions related to social media campaigns and influencer collaborations.

  follower count or just names?
