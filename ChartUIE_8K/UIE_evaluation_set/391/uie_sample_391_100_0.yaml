initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the influencer network in the media-and-communications
  sector. Plot influencers based on their follower count. Use text annotations to
  highlight the names and follower counts of top influencers. Highlight influencers
  in different groups (Tech, Music) using different colors. Emphasize nodes with the
  most significant followers by increasing their marker size. This will help identify
  influential figures and observe how various groups are interconnected. Add editorial
  comments to explain notable connections or anomalies. Ensure missing values are
  handled appropriately to maintain data integrity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different groups
  (Tech, Music) in the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the top influencers to be annotated? Should we use their full
  names, handles, or abbreviations?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for the editorial comments?

  5. Should we follow any specific guidelines or themes in terms of overall aesthetics
  or layout?

  6. Are there any specific ways you want missing values to be handled or represented
  in the chart?

  7. Is there a preference for the scale of the axes (linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Do you prefer any particular shapes for the scatter plot markers (e.g., circles,
  squares)?

  9. Would you like to see a legend to differentiate the groups, or should we rely
  on the color coding alone?

  10. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability, or do you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?'
