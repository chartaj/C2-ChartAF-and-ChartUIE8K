initial_prompt: Please create a network diagram visualizing the influencer network
  in the media and communications sector. Highlight nodes based on their follower
  counts, with the size or color of nodes indicating the number of followers. For
  key influencers with unique characteristics, such as those from different groups
  or having an exceptionally high follower count, add text annotations. These annotations
  should emphasize their importance within the network. This chart is to help identify
  influential individuals and their connections within the industry, providing insight
  into how information and influence flow among these figures.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting nodes based on
  follower counts?

  2. Would you like specific shapes for different groups or categories of influencers?

  3. Are there any specific size preferences for nodes to indicate the number of followers?

  4. Should the text annotations for key influencers have any particular font style
  or size?

  5. Do you want the edges (connections) between nodes to be styled in any specific
  way (e.g., line thickness or color)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends that you would like to be included in
  the chart?

  7. Would you prefer a particular layout style for the network diagram, such as circular,
  hierarchical, or force-directed?

  8. Is there any additional information you would like to include in the annotations
  for key influencers, apart from their importance within the network?'
