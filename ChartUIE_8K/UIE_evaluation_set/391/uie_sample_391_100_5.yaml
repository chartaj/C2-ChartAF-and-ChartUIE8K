initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the influencer network. Use the columns
  'Type', 'group', and 'followers' for the grouping. The heatmap should show the relationship
  between different influencer groups and their follower counts. Highlight any significant
  patterns or anomalies in terms of influencer groups with the most followers. The
  x-axis will represent different influencer groups, and the y-axis will be for the
  followers count. Also, differentiate by 'Type' if possible. This visualization will
  help identify which influencer groups have the most impact in media and communications.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend to help interpret the colors?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the range of followers to be highlighted
  (for example, a specific color for the highest and lowest follower counts)?

  4. How would you like significant patterns or anomalies to be highlighted?

  5. Should any specific influencer groups be emphasized in the heatmap?

  6. Is there any particular order you want the influencer groups to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  7. Would you prefer a gradient scale or discrete color steps for follower counts?

  8. How detailed should the differentiation by ''Type'' be in the heatmap (e.g.,
  different shading, patterns, or distinct colors)?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to add to the heatmap?

  10. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?'
