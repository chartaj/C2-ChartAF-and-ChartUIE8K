initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the Real Estate dataset. On the
  x-axis, use 'RM' (average number of rooms per dwelling) and on the y-axis, use 'MEDV'
  (Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s). Highlight data points where 'CHAS'
  equals 1 with a different color to represent properties near the Charles River.
  Please ensure missing data in 'RM' are addressed, either by removal or imputation.
  Include axis labels and a title for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  2. Would you like specific axis labels, or are the default labels of ''Average Number
  of Rooms per Dwelling'' and ''Median Value of Homes ($1000s)'' acceptable?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the data points, especially for highlighting
  properties near the Charles River?

  4. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight certain
  data points or trends?

  5. Is there a specific method you would prefer for handling missing data in ''RM''
  (e.g., mean/mode imputation, removal)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the markers (shapes or sizes) used in the scatter
  plot?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you need a legend on the chart to clarify that the differently colored points
  represent properties near the Charles River?

  9. Are there any additional statistical details or trend lines you would like to
  include in the scatter plot?'
