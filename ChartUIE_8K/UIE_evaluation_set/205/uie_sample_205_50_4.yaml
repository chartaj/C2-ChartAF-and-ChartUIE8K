initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different columns
  like CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX, RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, and
  MEDV from the Real Estate DataSet. Make sure to highlight the strongest correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the strongest correlations be highlighted with a specific color or pattern?

  3. Do you want the data labels to be displayed within each heatmap cell?

  4. Is there a specific range of correlation values you want to emphasize?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  6. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better separation of the cells?

  7. Do you want the correlation values to be annotated on the heatmap cells?

  8. How would you like the axis labels (column names) to be displayed, e.g., rotated
  or angled?

  9. Is there any specific font or font size you prefer for the text elements?

  10. Would you like a title or subtitle to be added to the heatmap? If yes, please
  specify.'
