initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the Real Estate DataSet. The heatmap should
  show the correlation between different features such as CRIM, ZN, INDUS, CHAS, NOX,
  RM, AGE, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT, and MEDV. Highlight areas with high correlation
  to easily identify how these variables interact with each other. Ensure missing
  values in the RM column are handled appropriately. Use a color gradient to differentiate
  positive and negative correlations, and include a color bar for reference. The heatmap
  will help in understanding the relationships between housing features and median
  values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include any specific annotations on the heatmap (e.g., correlation
  coefficients)?

  3. How would you like the missing values in the RM column to be handled (e.g., imputation,
  removal)?

  4. What range of the color gradient would you like to use for positive and negative
  correlations?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include for the heatmap
  and its axes?

  6. Is there a specific dimension or size preference for the heatmap?

  7. Would you prefer the heatmap to have grid lines separating the cells?

  8. Do you have a specific format for the correlation coefficient values (e.g., number
  of decimal places)?

  9. Would you like the diagonal of the heatmap (showing self-correlations) to be
  highlighted or treated differently?'
