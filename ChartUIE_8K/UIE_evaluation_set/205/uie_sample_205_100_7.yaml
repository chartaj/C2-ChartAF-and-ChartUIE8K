initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'MEDV' (median
  value of owner-occupied homes) in the Real Estate DataSet. Please use the '../Extra_datas/data/205.csv'
  data format provided. Make sure the chart shows the minimum, first quartile (25th
  percentile), median (50th percentile), third quartile (75th percentile), and maximum
  values. Highlight any outliers in the dataset. This will help me understand the
  spread and central tendency of home values within the dataset. Ensure the chart
  is properly labeled and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the box and whiskers?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be marked with a specific symbol or color?

  3. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the chart for easier interpretation?

  5. Would you prefer any annotations or comments on the chart to explain key points?

  6. Is there a specific font type or size you would like for the labels and title?

  7. Do you want to add any additional statistical measures, such as mean or standard
  deviation, on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred format for the axis labels (e.g., scientific notation,
  currency, plain numbers)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include the title "Distribution of MEDV (Median Value of Owner-Occupied
  Homes)"

  4. Yes, please include gridlines.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No, just the basic box plot statistics.

  8. Plain numbers will be fine.'
