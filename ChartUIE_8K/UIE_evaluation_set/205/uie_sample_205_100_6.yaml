initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the Real Estate DataSet.
  Display the 'MEDV' column as the primary variable, and use a different color for
  different 'CHAS' values (0 and 1). Each column should represent a unique combination
  of 'ZN' and 'RAD' values. The height of each segment within a column should correspond
  to the average 'MEDV' for that 'CHAS' value. Label the x-axis with combinations
  of 'ZN' and 'RAD', and the y-axis with 'MEDV'. This will help compare median home
  values across different zones and accessibility ratings, highlighting the impact
  of the Charles River adjacency.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different ''CHAS''
  values (0 and 1)?

  2. Do you want to include any specific annotations or labels on the chart for emphasizing
  critical data points?

  3. Should the chart have grid lines for easier readability of the y-axis values?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to identify the different ''CHAS'' values,
  and if so, where would you prefer it to be placed (e.g., right, top, bottom)?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds or reference lines you would like to be added
  to the chart for comparison purposes?

  7. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?'
