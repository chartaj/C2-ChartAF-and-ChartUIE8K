  Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ''RM'' (number of rooms) in
  the real estate dataset. Highlight bars representing missing values to show their
  impact. Add shapes to emphasize trends, such as a line displaying the average number
  of rooms. Utilize annotations to note key data points, like the median and outliers
  in the distribution. Use color highlights to differentiate between ranges of room
  counts for clearer analysis. Ensure the histogram effectively showcases the variations
  in ''RM'' and its relationship to ''MEDV'' (median value of homes) where applicable.
