  do you prefer?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Would you like any specific highlights, such as tooltips or annotations, to emphasize
  certain data points?

  8. Should the confidence intervals be shaded and differentiated in a specific way
  (e.g., different patterns or opacities)?

  9. Do you want to include a chart title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  10. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
