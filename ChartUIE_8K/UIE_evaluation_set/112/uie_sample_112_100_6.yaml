initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization to depict the caffeine content of drinks.
  Use data from the provided CSV file showing various drinks, their volume in ml,
  calories, caffeine content in mg, and type. Make sure to highlight different types
  of drinks (e.g., coffee, energy drinks) and their caffeine content distinctly. In
  each section of the treemap, include the name of the drink and its caffeine content
  visually apparent. The size of each section should correspond to the volume of the
  drink. This will help in understanding the distribution of caffeine across different
  drink types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different types of drinks
  (e.g., coffee, energy drinks)?

  2. How would you like the caffeine content to be visually represented in each section:
  as text, as a percentage, or with another method?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the drink names and
  caffeine content?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the treemap that should be
  used?

  5. Should the sections be ordered in any particular way, such as by volume or alphabetically
  by drink name?

  6. Would you prefer to see any additional information on hover or within each section
  (e.g., calories)?

  7. Is there any specific spacing or padding you would like between the sections
  of the treemap?

  8. Are there any branding guidelines or themes (e.g., specific colors, logo) that
  need to be incorporated into the treemap?'
