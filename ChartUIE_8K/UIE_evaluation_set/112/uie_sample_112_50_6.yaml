initial_prompt: Create a treemap displaying the caffeine content of various drinks.
  Use "type" as the categorical variable, and the size of each block to represent
  the "Volume (ml)" with blocks colored by "Caffeine (mg)".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different levels
  of caffeine content?

  2. Do you want to display labels on each block, and if so, what information should
  be included (e.g., drink name, caffeine content, volume)?

  3. Should the treemap include a legend explaining the color gradient for caffeine
  content?

  4. How would you prefer to handle drinks with extremely high or low caffeine content
  in terms of color representation?

  5. Would you like to incorporate any filtering or grouping options based on drink
  types?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the layout and spacing of blocks within
  the treemap?

  7. Should any specific annotations or highlights be included to emphasize certain
  types or levels of caffeine content?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text within the treemap
  blocks?'
