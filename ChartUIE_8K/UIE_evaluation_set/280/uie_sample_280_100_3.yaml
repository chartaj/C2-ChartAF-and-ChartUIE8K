initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualizing "Religious Populations Worldwide" for
  different religions over the years. Use the data on population counts for each religion
  category (like Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, etc.) for specific years
  in the "sample_data". It should showcase the distribution of populations across
  these religious categories. The X-axis should represent the different religions,
  and the Y-axis should show the population counts. Highlight the variation and trends
  in populations to illustrate the diversity and changes over the specified timeframe.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for the different religions represented
  in the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific style for the box plots, such as traditional or violin
  plots?

  3. Is there a preferred way of handling outliers in the box plot (e.g., include,
  exclude, or mark separately)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines?

  7. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  8. Would you like to display data value labels on the chart?

  9. Is there a particular font or style you''d like for the labels and title?

  10. Do you have any preference for the range or scaling of the y-axis?

  11. Would you prefer a specific order for the religions on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  population size)?

  12. Are there specific years you want to highlight or focus on within the timeframe?

  13. Is there a requirement for annotations or notes to be included on any specific
  data points?

  14. Would you like to incorporate confidence intervals or other statistical indicators?'
