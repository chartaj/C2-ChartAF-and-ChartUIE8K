initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the worldwide religious population data
  from 1945 to 1955. Focus on highlighting the proportions of major religions like
  Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, representing each by distinct colors. Add text
  annotations for highest and lowest values in each religion group to emphasize key
  data points. This visualization aims to explore trends in religious demographics
  globally over the decade, providing insights into significant shifts or stability
  within these populations. The chart should visually distinguish various religious
  segments to facilitate easy comparison and better understanding of the data's context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to represent
  Christianity, Judaism, and Islam?

  2. What style of text annotations do you prefer for highlighting the highest and
  lowest values (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the legend on the scatter plot?

  4. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would like to include on the
  chart?

  5. Would you like to set a specific range or scale for the axes to better visualize
  trends?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall size or dimensions of the scatter
  plot?

  7. Are there any additional data points or attributes you would like to be annotated
  or highlighted apart from the highest and lowest values?

  8. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the scatter plot (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, professional)?

  9. Should there be any specific markers or symbols used for the different religious
  groups in the scatter plot?'
