initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing investment amounts versus
  equity percentages for the different brands featured in Shark Tank India Season
  1. Use different colors or markers to represent which sharks participated in the
  investment. Each point should correspond to a brand and display the investment amount
  (in lakhs INR) on the x-axis and the equity percentage on the y-axis. This will
  help to easily compare which brands received the most significant investments and
  what equity the sharks offered.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different sharks?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each data point (brand names), or should
  they be visible through tooltips only?

  3. Should the equity percentage values be displayed as raw numerical values, or
  would you prefer percentages (e.g., 30%)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the shape of the markers for each shark, or should
  we use unique shapes by default?

  5. Are there any specific brands or sharks you would like to highlight in the scatter
  plot?

  6. Are there any particular ranges of investment amounts or equity percentages you
  are interested in focusing on?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which color or marker corresponds
  to which shark?

  8. Should the x-axis (investment amount) and y-axis (equity percentage) be scaled
  in a specific way (e.g., logarithmic scale)?

  9. Do you have a preferred size for the markers in the scatter plot?

  10. Would you like to add any annotations or notes to the chart for additional context?'
