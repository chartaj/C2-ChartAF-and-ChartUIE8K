initial_prompt: Please create a table chart for the Shark Tank Indian Companies dataset.
  The table should display columns for Episode Number, Brand, Investment Amount (In
  Lakhs INR), Debt (In lakhs INR), Equity, Anupam, Ashneer, Namita, Aman, Peyush,
  Vineeta, Ghazal, and Season. Make sure to highlight the unique brands and investment
  details per episode to visualize which sharks invested in each company. Also, indicate
  any missing values and their data types clearly for better understanding. The aim
  is to summarize the investment patterns and involvement of each shark.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the type of highlight to use for unique
  brands and investment details per episode (e.g., color coding, bold text, background
  shading)?

  in better understanding the data?

  3. Do you have preferred colors for indicating missing values and their data types?

  4. Would you like to see any particular sorting order for the columns (e.g., chronological
  order of episodes, alphabetical order of brands)?

  5. Is there a specific way you want the data to be grouped, such as by season or
  by investor?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the table text to ensure readability?

  7. Should we include any specific legends or notes in the table to explain the highlights
  or coding?

  8. Do you have a specific layout preference for the table, such as horizontal or
  vertical alignment of columns?

  9. Would you like to include any summary statistics (e.g., total investment amount
  per season, average equity percentage) in the table?'
