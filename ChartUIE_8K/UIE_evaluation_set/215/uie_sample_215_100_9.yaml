initial_prompt: I need a line chart showcasing the investment amounts received by
  different brands in Shark Tank India Season 1. The x-axis should represent the different
  episode numbers, while the y-axis should display the investment amounts in lakhs
  INR. For each episode, plot the investment amounts for each brand. This will help
  visualize the trend of investments over the episodes and how much each brand has
  received. Make sure to differentiate the brands with different colored lines and
  include legends for clarity. Add appropriate labels and title to the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the colors of the lines representing each brand?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include units of measurement (e.g., ''Episode
  Number'', ''Investment Amount (In Lakhs INR)'')?

  5. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific area of the chart (e.g.,
  top-right, bottom-left)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  title?

  7. Do you need any annotations or markers for significant data points in the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis have a fixed range, or should it adjust automatically based
  on the data?

  9. Is there a specific format you prefer for the x-axis labels, such as displaying
  every episode number or only major intervals?

  10. Would you like to incorporate any trend lines or moving averages in the chart
  to highlight trends?'
