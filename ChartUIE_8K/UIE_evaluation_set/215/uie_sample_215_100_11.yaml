initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing the equity distribution for
  brands by different investors in Shark Tank India. Use the 'Equity' column for the
  y-axis, and 'Brand' for the x-axis. The different investors (Anupam, Ashneer, Namita,
  Aman, Peyush, Vineeta, Ghazal) should be represented in different colors within
  each bar to show which investor contributed to what percentage of equity for each
  brand. This will help understand the involvement of each investor per brand during
  Season 1. Ensure the chart clearly differentiates the equity shares among the investors.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for representing different investors?

  2. Would you like to have labels showing the exact percentage of equity on each
  segment of the bar?

  3. Do you prefer to have gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should there be a legend to indicate which color represents which investor?

  5. Do you want tooltips to appear when hovering over each segment to show details
  like investor name and equity percentage?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the brands to be displayed on the
  x-axis?

  7. Do you want the chart to have a title and subtitles for additional context?

  8. Should the axis titles (x-axis and y-axis) be customized with specific wording?

  9. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight
  specific insights?'
