initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the commitments of various investors
  (Anupam, Ashneer, Namita, Aman, Peyush, Vineeta, and Ghazal) across different brands
  per episode. The X-axis should list the investors, and the Y-axis should list the
  brand names. Fill in the cells with color intensity to show if an investor was willing
  to invest ('Y') or not ('N'). This visualization will help understand which brands
  attracted the most interest from investors during Season 1. Please ensure that the
  heatmap clearly differentiates 'Y' and 'N'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating ''Y'' and
  ''N'' values in the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include labels or legends for better clarity?

  3. Do you want to highlight any specific investors or brands in the heatmap?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to have any specific dimensions or aspect ratio?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be included in the heatmap for better readability?

  7. Should the heatmap display data values (i.e., ''Y'' and ''N'') within each cell?'
