initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization for the "Shark Tank Indian Companies"
  data. Each rectangle should represent a brand and be sized according to the investment
  amount in lakhs INR. Use different colors to indicate the sharks who invested (e.g.,
  Anupam, Ashneer, Namita). The treemap should include labels for episode number,
  debt, equity, and season. Make sure to highlight the most frequently invested brands

  the popularity of different brands. Keep it visually appealing and easy to understand.
