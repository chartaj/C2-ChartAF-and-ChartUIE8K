initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the changes in the number
  of autocracies and democracies globally from 1930 to 2018. Use the years (1930,
  1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2018) as the x-axis and the number
  of countries as the y-axis. Each group should represent a year with separate bars
  for autocracies and democracies. Add a legend to differentiate between autocracies
  and democracies and ensure the chart is titled appropriately to reflect political
  changes over time.
