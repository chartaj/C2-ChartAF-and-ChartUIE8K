initial_prompt: Create a box plot chart to visualize students' performance in math,
  reading, and writing scores by gender. This chart should highlight the distribution
  and spread of scores for both male and female students. Use the text annotations
  to display mean scores for each subject within the boxes. Emphasize outliers by
  highlighting them differently to draw attention. The purpose of the visualization
  is to understand how gender influences academic performance across different subjects
  and to identify patterns or discrepancies in the scores.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for male and female
  categories?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color for highlighting outliers?

  3. Would you like the mean scores to be displayed as bold or in a different font
  style?

  4. Do you have a preference for the position of text annotations for the mean scores
  (inside the boxes, above the boxes, etc.)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between genders and outliers?

  6. Would you prefer the box plots to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  7. Do you want grid lines in the background to make the chart easier to read?

  8. Should the chart include additional statistical information, like median or quartiles,
  beyond the mean scores?

  9. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the text annotations and labels
  on the chart?

  10. Would you like any additional information or context displayed in the chart
  title or subtitles?'
