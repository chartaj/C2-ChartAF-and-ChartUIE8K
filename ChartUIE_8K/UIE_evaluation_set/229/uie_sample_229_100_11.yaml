initial_prompt: Please create a tile map to visualize the global COVID-19 impact using
  the provided data. The map should show different countries based on "Country" from
  the dataset. Each tile should reflect "Total Cases," "Total Deaths," and "Total
  Recovered." Please differentiate tiles by a color gradient to indicate the severity
  based on "Total Cases." Also, include a tooltip to display the exact numbers for
  "Total Cases," "Total Deaths," "Total Recovered," and "Active Cases" when hovering
  over each country. Ensure the map is clear and easy to interpret, showing missing
  data appropriately. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the color gradient indicating
  the severity based on ''Total Cases''?

  2. Would you like the tiles to have labels showing the country names, or should
  this information only be available via the tooltip?

  3. Should the map include a legend explaining the color gradient used for ''Total
  Cases'' severity?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like missing data to be indicated on the map
  (e.g., a distinct color or pattern)?

  5. Would you prefer a particular layout style for the tile map (e.g., alphabetical
  order, geographical proximity)?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds for ''Total Cases'' that you want to be distinctly
  highlighted in the gradient?

  7. Do you want the size of each tile to be uniform, or should it vary based on some
  data attribute like population?'
answers: "1. I do not know. \n2. I am not sure, maybe labels showing the country names\
  \ could be helpful.\n3. Yes, include a legend explaining the color gradient used\
  \ for 'Total Cases' severity.\n4. I do not know.\n5. I am not sure.\n6. I do not\
