initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the trends of Total Cases, Total
  Deaths, and Total Recovered over time for each country. Make sure to differentiate
  the lines by country for clear comparison. Visualize data from multiple countries
  effectively.

  the lines for each country?

  2. What time interval should be used on the x-axis (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  between Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered?

  4. Would you like to include data labels for key points on the lines (e.g., peaks,
  start, or end points)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or compare more prominently?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, do
  you prefer major, minor, or both types of grid lines?

  9. Should the chart include annotations or markers for significant events or dates?

  10. Do you have any font style or size preferences for the chart titles, axis labels,
  and legend text?'
