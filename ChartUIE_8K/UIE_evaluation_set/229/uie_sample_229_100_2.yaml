initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize Covid-19 metrics for countries
  like the USA, India, and France. Display Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered
  for each country side by side. Use different colors for each metric. Highlight the
  USA with a distinct color and add annotations for Total Cases and Total Deaths.
