initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot visualizing Covid-19 data worldwide using
  the provided dataset. On the X-axis, label it with country names. On the Y-axis,
  plot the values for Total Cases and Total Deaths. Use different colors to distinguish
  between Total Cases and Total Deaths. Ensure to indicate any missing values and
  use appropriate scaling for readability. The goal is to have a clear visual comparison
  of the Covid-19 impact in various countries. This plot will help in understanding
  which countries were most affected based on the number of cases and deaths reported.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between Total
  Cases and Total Deaths?

  2. Should we use a specific symbol or shape for the dots representing Total Cases
  and Total Deaths?

  3. How would you like missing values to be indicated on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the scale type on the Y-axis (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  5. Would you like any labels or annotations on specific data points or countries?

  6. Do you prefer the countries on the X-axis to be sorted in a particular order
  (e.g., alphabetically, by Total Cases, by Total Deaths)?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines for improved readability?

  9. Are there any additional data filters or criteria you would like to apply to
  the dataset before visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Indicate missing values with a specific symbol, maybe a cross or a different
  color.

  4. Linear scale on the Y-axis would be preferable.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Sort the countries by Total Cases.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, include grid lines for improved readability.

  9. No, no additional filters or criteria needed.'
