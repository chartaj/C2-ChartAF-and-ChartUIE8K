initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing global Covid-19 total cases. Use
  the provided data on countries, cases, deaths, recoveries, tests, and populations
  for clear representation. Highlight differences and trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the Choropleth map?

  2. How would you like to handle countries with missing data?

  3. Should the map include legends for easier interpretation of the data ranges?

  4. Would you prefer to display absolute numbers or normalized data (e.g., cases
  per 100,000 population)?

  5. Do you require labeling of specific countries on the map?

  6. Are there any particular countries or regions you would like to highlight?

  7. Should the map show only the current data, or would you like to include time-series
  animation to show trends over time?

  8. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  9. How much detail should be included in the map (e.g., country borders, major cities)?

  10. Would you prefer a static legend or a dynamic one based on user interaction
  (though we won''t focus on interactivity for this task)?'
