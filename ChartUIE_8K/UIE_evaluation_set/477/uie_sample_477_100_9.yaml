initial_prompt: Create a line chart tracking the popularity of answers over time for
  the question "How was Pizza Mercato?" at Pizza Mercato. X-axis should represent
  time (timestamp) and Y-axis should represent the number of votes. Each line will
  represent a possible answer (Excellent, Good, Average). The chart should provide
  a clear comparison of how each rating option fluctuates in popularity over the recorded
  times. Use different colors for each line to distinguish the answers effectively.
  Ensure the chart is easy to read and understand. This is for a food-and-drink review
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the time interval on the X-axis (e.g.,
  days, weeks, months)?

  2. What colors would you like to use for each rating option (Excellent, Good, Average)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for each rating option?

  4. Should the Y-axis be displayed in a particular range or scale (e.g., logarithmic
  scale)?

  5. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines to highlight individual
  data points?

  6. Do you need grid lines on the chart for better readability? If so, for both axes
  or just one?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  8. Would you like to include axis labels? If so, do you have a preference for their
  wording?

  9. Should we include a legend to distinguish between the different rating options?
  If yes, do you have a preferred placement for the legend?
