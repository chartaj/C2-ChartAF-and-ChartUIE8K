initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for me. I want to visualize the distribution
  of votes for different answers in a poll about "How was Pizza Mercato?" at a place
  called Pizza Mercato, collected at a specific time. The categories should include
  "Excellent," "Good," "Average," etc., with votes on the x-axis and the count of
  each type of vote on the y-axis. Make sure it's easy to see which answers got the
  most and least votes. This data is part of a food-and-drink survey called pizza_jared.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the votes labeled directly on the histogram bars?

  3. Do you want gridlines displayed on the histogram?

  4. Should the x-axis categories (''Excellent'', ''Good'', ''Average'', etc.) be
  displayed in a specific order?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should we include any annotations or notes on the histogram to highlight specific
  data points?

  8. Do you have any specific margins or padding preferences around the histogram?

  9. Would you like to see axis ticks or axis lines emphasized in any particular way?

  10. Do you want a legend included even if there is only one series of data?'
