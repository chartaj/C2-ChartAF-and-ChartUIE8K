initial_prompt: Please create a Pie chart showing the distribution of answers for
  the question "How was Pizza Mercato?" from the data provided in the CSV. The chart
  should illustrate the percentages of votes for each answer category (Excellent,
  Good, Average, etc.). Make sure each slice of the pie represents one of the answers,
  and use contrasting colors for each slice to distinguish them clearly. The chart
  title should be "Customer Feedback on Pizza Mercato". Label each slice with the
  corresponding answer and its percentage value. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or a color scheme you would
  like to use for the pie chart slices?

  2. Would you like the percentages to be displayed within the slices or outside the
  slices?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and chart title?

  4. Do you want the chart to include a legend in addition to the slice labels?

  5. Should the slices be ordered in a particular way, such as from highest to lowest
  percentage?

  6. Would you prefer the pie chart to have 3D effects or remain in a 2D format?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would like for the pie chart?'
