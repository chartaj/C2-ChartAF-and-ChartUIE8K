initial_prompt: I need a column chart for "Pizza Mercato" reviews to help visualize
  customer satisfaction. Use the 'question,' 'answer,' 'votes,' and 'percent' columns
  primarily. The x-axis should represent the different answers (Excellent, Good, Average),
  while the y-axis should display the number of votes. Include the percent of total
  votes as labels on each column for better insight. This will help us understand
  how well customers rate the pizza from "Pizza Mercato." The chart should be clear
  and easy to interpret for quick decision-making in improving services.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the columns representing different
  answers (Excellent, Good, Average)?

  2. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels and titles?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it auto-adjust based on the
  data?

  5. Do you prefer any specific positioning for the percent labels on each column
  (e.g., inside, outside, at the top)?

  6. Is there any additional information you would like to include in the chart title
  or subtitle?'
answers: '1. I prefer a color scheme with green for Excellent, yellow for Good, and
  red for Average.
