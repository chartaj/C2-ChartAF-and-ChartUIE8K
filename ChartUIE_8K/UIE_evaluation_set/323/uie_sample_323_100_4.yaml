initial_prompt: I want to visualize the comparison of three different data sources
  (mlsrc, quantumsrc, dlsrc) across various states of India. Please create a stacked
  column chart showing the contribution of each data source per state. The x-axis
  should represent the states, and the y-axis should be the value counts from each
  source. Use distinct colors for each source. Make sure to include a legend to differentiate
  between mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc. The chart should help see which states have
  higher counts in any specific data source.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct colors\
  \ representing each data source (mlsrc, quantumsrc, dlsrc)?\n2. What is the preferred\
  \ order of states on the x-axis? Alphabetical, by value, or another criterion?\n\
  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for labels and legend?\n4. Should\
  \ the y-axis have a specific range or scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?\n5. Would\
  \ you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?\n6. Do you\
  \ need any additional annotations on the chart to highlight key data points or states?\n\
  7. Is there a specific format or display style you prefer for the legend? \n8. Do\
  \ you require any labels or tooltips to show detailed values when hovering over\
  \ each segment of the stacked column? \n9. What title, if any, would you like to\
  \ be displayed on the chart?\n10. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart\
  \ size or aspect ratio?"
