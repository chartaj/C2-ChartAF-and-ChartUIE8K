initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the distribution of machine learning, quantum,
  and deep learning resources across states. Highlight states with high resource allocation.
  Annotate notable states.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a specific color gradient to represent different levels
  of resource allocation?

  3. How would you like the high resource allocation states to be highlighted? (e.g.,
  using a different color, a border, etc.)

  4. Do you have any specific states that you want annotated aside from those with
  high resource allocation?

  5. What level of resource allocation would you consider as "high"?

  6. Would you prefer the annotations to be in a specific format or style?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient and what they
  represent?

  8. How detailed do you want the annotations to be? (e.g., just the state name, or
  include specific allocation details)

  9. Do you have any preference for the font size or type used in the chart?

  10. Should the chart include any additional contextual information, such as a title
  or a description?'
