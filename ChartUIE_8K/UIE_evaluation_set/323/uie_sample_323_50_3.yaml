initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the 'mlsrc,' 'quantumsrc,' and 'dlsrc'
  values for each 'state' using the given data format. Ensure each state is labeled
  along the x-axis, with separate bars for each data type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing ''mlsrc,''
  ''quantumsrc,'' and ''dlsrc''?

  2. Should the bars for each ''state'' be grouped together or stacked?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on top of each bar to show the exact values?

  4. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  6. Should the chart include a title? If yes, what should it be?

  7. Do you need a legend to identify which color corresponds to which data type (''mlsrc,''
  ''quantumsrc,'' and ''dlsrc'')?

  8. Are there any specific states that you would like to highlight or focus on within
  the chart?

  9. Would you like to have a horizontal or vertical bar chart?

  10. Do you need annotations or additional information on certain bars or data points?'
