initial_prompt: I'd like to create a scatter plot using the data from `../Extra_datas/data/323.csv`.
  Could you plot 'mlsrc' on the x-axis and 'quantumsrc' on the y-axis for different
  states? Please make sure to label the points with the state names clearly. Also,
  differentiate the dots by color based on the 'dlsrc' values if possible. I'm interested
  in how machine learning research funding correlates with quantum research funding
  across different states. Could you help visualize this so I can easily analyze their
  relationship? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the dots by ''dlsrc'' values?

  2. What size would you prefer for the labels of state names on the plot?

  3. Should there be a legend to explain the colors used for ''dlsrc'' values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the shape of the dots on the scatter plot?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines for better visualization of the correlation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the size.

  3. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  4. I do not have a preference for the shape of the dots.

  5. Yes, including gridlines would be good.'
