initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart showing the search volume for google
  trends in different states. Use 'state' as the x-axis and the search volumes from
  'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc' as different stacks.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different stacks (''mlsrc'',
  ''quantumsrc'', ''dlsrc'')?

  2. Would you like to customize the font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  3. Should the x-axis labels (state names) be rotated for better readability?

  4. Do you want to include data labels on each stack showing the precise search volume?

  5. Should there be a legend explaining what each stack represents? If so, do you
  have a preferred position for it (e.g., top, bottom, side)?

  6. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart for easier comparison of values?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart title or subtitle?

  8. Should the chart include tooltips that display additional information when hovering
  over each stack?

  9. Would you prefer a specific order for the stacks (e.g., always ''mlsrc'' on the
  bottom, ''quantumsrc'' in the middle, and ''dlsrc'' on top)?

  10. Are there any specific states you would like to highlight or mark differently
  on the chart?'
