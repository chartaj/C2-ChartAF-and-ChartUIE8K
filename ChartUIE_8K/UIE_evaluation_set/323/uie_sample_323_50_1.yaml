initial_prompt: Visualize statewise distribution in a pie chart highlighting states
  with significant mlsrc values. Annotate slices with state names and corresponding
  mlsrc values. The purpose is to understand statewise prevalence from the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart slices?

  2. How would you like the significant ''mlsrc'' values to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different colors, bolder borders)?

  3. Do you prefer a 2D or 3D pie chart?

  4. What threshold should be used to classify ''mlsrc'' values as significant?

  5. Do you want a legend accompanying the pie chart?

  6. Would you prefer the slices to be sorted in a specific order (e.g., descending
  order of ''mlsrc'' values)?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the annotations?

  8. Do you want the percentages to be displayed on the slices along with the state
  names and ''mlsrc'' values?'
