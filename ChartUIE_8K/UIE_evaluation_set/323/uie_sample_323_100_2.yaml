initial_prompt: 'Visualize state-level data using a heatmap to highlight differences
  in mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc values for better insight into resource distribution.
  Annotate states with the highest and lowest values to focus attention. Make sure
  to use distinct colors for easy comparison. Highlight the four key columns: state,
  mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc. The purpose is to identify trends and anomalies in
  resource allocation among different states quickly. This visualization will help
  in decision-making by clearly showing which states have high or low resource levels,
  facilitating strategies to address disparities.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap to ensure
  distinct comparisons?

  2. What level of granularity do you prefer for the color scale (e.g., high, medium,
  low)?

  3. Would you like to include numerical annotations for all states or only for those
  with the highest and lowest values?

  4. Do you have a preferred method of annotating the highest and lowest values (e.g.,
  bold text, different color, or special markers)?

  5. Is there a particular format for the labels or fonts that you would like to see
  used in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to incorporate any additional contextual elements, such as state
  boundaries or names?

  7. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (horizontal,
  vertical)?

  8. How many different color intensities or gradients would you like to include in
  the heatmap for value distinctions?

  9. Are there any specific thresholds for the resource values that you want to be
  highlighted differently?

  10. Do you wish to see any legends or labels explaining the color scales directly
  on the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  2. Medium granularity for the color scale should be fine.

  3. Only for those with the highest and lowest values, please.

  4. I am not sure about the method for annotating the highest and lowest values.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for labels or fonts.

  6. Yes, it would be helpful to incorporate state names.

  7. I am not sure about the layout or orientation.

  8. I am not sure about the number of color intensities or gradients.

  9. I am not sure about specific thresholds for the resource values.

  10. Yes, including legends or labels explaining the color scales would be helpful.'
