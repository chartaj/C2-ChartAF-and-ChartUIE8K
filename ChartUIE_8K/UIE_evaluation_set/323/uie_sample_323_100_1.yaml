initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of states based on
  mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc values. Highlight key states with the highest values
  in each category using distinct colors. Add data-driven annotations to indicate
  the exact values for these highlighted states. This will help focus attention on
  the most significant data points. Use the chart to analyze state-wise contributions
  in different categories. The purpose is to provide a comparative overview and aid
  in quick understanding of data trends across the states. This information is key
  for identifying regional performance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlighted states
  with the highest values?

  2. How many key states would you like to highlight in each category (mlsrc, quantumsrc,
  dlsrc)?

  3. Do you prefer any particular labels or legends for distinguishing between the
  categories (mlsrc, quantumsrc, dlsrc)?

  4. Would you like the pie chart to include percentage values along with the exact
  values in the annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a title or any specific explanatory notes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the annotations or legends?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the states to be displayed,
  such as alphabetical order or by value magnitude?

  8. Would you like to include a legend that specifies which color corresponds to
  each state?

  9. Are there any specific states you want to be emphasized or de-emphasized in the
  visualization?'
