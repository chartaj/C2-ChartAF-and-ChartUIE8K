initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot comparing mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc against
  states from the given data. Highlight unique data points for different states. This
  is for visualizing variations in these metrics across the states for online-community
  analysis. Utilize different colors for each metric and add labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different metrics (mlsrc,
  quantumsrc, dlsrc)?

  2. Are there specific marker styles you would like for distinguishing the different
  states?

  3. Would you like the axis labels and titles to be in a specific font style or size?

  4. Do you prefer to have a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  5. Is there a particular range or scale for the axes that you would like to set?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the size and aspect ratio of the scatter
  plot?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  in the chart?'
