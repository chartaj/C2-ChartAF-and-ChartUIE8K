initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the traffic flow data over time.
  The 'DateTime' column will be on the x-axis, showing different time intervals, and
  the 'Vehicles' column will be on the y-axis, displaying the number of vehicles passing
  through each junction. Highlight key time points where the vehicle count significantly
  changes. Add text annotations to specific data points to describe significant changes
  or trends. The chart will help in understanding traffic patterns at different junctions
  and can be used for future traffic predictions and management.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the line
  chart?

  2. Would you like to differentiate data for different junctions using different
  line styles or colors?

  3. Are there particular time intervals you want to highlight on the x-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the format of the date and time displayed on the
  x-axis?

  5. How would you like significant changes in vehicle count to be highlighted (e.g.,
  using markers, colors, or line thickness)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for text annotations on the chart?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate lines if multiple lines are
  used for different junctions?

  8. Would you like any gridlines or reference lines to be added to the chart?

  9. Are there any specific trends or data points you would like to see annotated
  with descriptive text?

  10. Do you have preference for the chart''s title and axis labels?'
