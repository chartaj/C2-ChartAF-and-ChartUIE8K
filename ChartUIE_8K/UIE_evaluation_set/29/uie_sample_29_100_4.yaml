initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the Traffic Prediction Dataset you have. Please
  create a bar chart. The x-axis should represent different 'Junctions' while the
  y-axis should show the 'Vehicles'. The chart should indicate the total number of
  vehicles for each junction and should highlight distinct colors for each junction.
  Make sure to include labels for the axes and a title for the chart, something like
  "Number of Vehicles Per Junction". I need this visualization to understand the traffic
  flow at different junctions over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for each junction, or should they be
  randomly assigned?

  2. Would you like to see data labels displaying the exact counts of vehicles on
  each bar?

  3. Is there a preferred order for the junctions on the x-axis (e.g., numerical,
  alphabetical, or other criteria)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style and size of the axis labels and title
  font?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included, even if the colors for each junction
  are distinct and labeled on the x-axis?

  6. Should there be gridlines in the background of the chart to help with reading
  values, or would you prefer a cleaner look without them?

  7. Is there a specific width or aspect ratio for the chart that you have in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to see data labels displaying the exact counts of vehicles
  on each bar.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the order of the junctions.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No, I do not need a legend to be included.

  6. I would prefer gridlines in the background to help with reading values.

  7. I have no specific preference for the width or aspect ratio.'
