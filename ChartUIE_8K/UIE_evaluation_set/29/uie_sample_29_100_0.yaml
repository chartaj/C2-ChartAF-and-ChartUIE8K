initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the number of vehicles over
  time at different junctions using the traffic prediction dataset. Highlight the
  junctions with the highest and lowest vehicle counts to draw attention to busy and
  less busy areas. Annotate the peaks of vehicle counts to show the busiest times
  specifically. Use different colors or sizes for junctions to make comparisons easier.
  Make sure to include contextual information to help understand the data better.
  The purpose of this chart is to analyze traffic patterns at various junctions, aiding
  in better traffic management and planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  between junctions?

  2. Would you like the histogram bins to represent specific time intervals (e.g.,
  hourly, daily, weekly)?

  3. Do you prefer the vehicle counts to be represented by different sizes or different
  colors for each junction?

  4. Should the peaks and troughs be annotated with specific labels or just highlighted
  visually?

  5. Is there any specific contextual information you would like to be included (e.g.,
  weather conditions, special events)?

  6. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  7. Would you like any additional legends or keys to explain the color or size variations
  in the chart?

  8. Is there a specific format or style for annotations that you prefer?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Hourly intervals would be great.

  3. Different colors for each junction.

  4. Just highlighted visually.

  5. I do not know.

  6. The x-axis as "Time of Day" and y-axis as "Number of Vehicles".

  7. Yes, a legend to explain the color variations.

  8. I have no specific preference.
