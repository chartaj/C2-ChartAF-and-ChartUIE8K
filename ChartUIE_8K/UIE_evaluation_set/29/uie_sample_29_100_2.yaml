initial_prompt: Visualize the traffic prediction dataset using a heatmap. The x-axis
  should represent different DateTime values, and the y-axis should represent the
  Junction numbers. The intensity of the heatmap cells should reflect the number of
  Vehicles. Use text annotations to highlight specific DateTime and Junction combinations
  with unusually high or low vehicle counts. Modify the color scale to emphasize peak
  traffic times for better visual contrast. The objective is to allow quick identification
  of traffic patterns and anomalies across various junctions in the dataset. This
  will be useful for understanding and managing traffic flow effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences on the color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style and size for text annotations?

  3. Are there any specific DateTime intervals you want to highlight more prominently?

  4. Do you have any preferences on the range or limits for the color scale?

  5. Should the heatmap include grid lines or borders around each cell?

  6. Do you want to include a legend or color bar to explain the intensity scale?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?

  8. Do you want to add any titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis, or the heatmap
  as a whole?

  9. Do you need any additional markers or indicators for peak traffic times beyond
  just the color scale?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I prefer highlighting rush hours in the morning and evening.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines around each cell.

  6. Yes, I would like a legend or color bar to explain the intensity scale.

  7. I do not have a specific size or aspect ratio preference.

  8. Yes, please include titles and labels for the x-axis, y-axis, and the heatmap
  as a whole.
