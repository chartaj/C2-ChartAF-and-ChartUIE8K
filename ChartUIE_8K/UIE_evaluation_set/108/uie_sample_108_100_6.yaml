initial_prompt: I want to visualize the obesity levels in a treemap using the dataset.
  The data includes several categorical and numerical variables like Age, Gender,
  Height, Weight, and various behavioral factors. I need the treemap to display the
  distribution of different obesity levels (NObeyesdad) and show how other factors
  like CALC, FAVC, and CAEC are related. Color-code the sections based on obesity
  levels and size each section by weight. Please make it interactive so I can hover
  over each section to see detailed information.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the different obesity
  levels?

  2. How would you like the behavioral factors CALC, FAVC, and CAEC to be displayed
  within the treemap?

  3. Should the size of each section be strictly proportional to weight, or do you
  prefer a different method?

  4. Do you want to add labels or annotations to the sections? If so, what kind of
  information should they include?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or a key for the color-coding?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text within the treemap?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the levels of obesity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, the size of each section should be strictly proportional to weight.

  4. Yes, include labels that show detailed information such as Age, Gender, Height,
  and corresponding behavioral factors like CALC, FAVC, and CAEC.

  5. Yes, include a legend or a key for the color-coding.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.'
