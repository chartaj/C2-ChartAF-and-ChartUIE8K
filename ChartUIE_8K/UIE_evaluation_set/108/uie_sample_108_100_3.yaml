initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of obesity
  levels ('NObeyesdad') categorized by gender ('Gender'). The x-axis should represent
  different obesity levels, and the y-axis should indicate the count of individuals
  in each obesity level. Each bar should be color-coded based on gender (Male, Female)
  to compare the obesity levels between males and females. This will help to understand
  how gender influences obesity within the collected data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different genders?

  2. Do you have a preferred order for the different obesity levels on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want any specific labels or annotations on the chart to highlight significant
  findings?

  4. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?

  5. Would you like grid lines or reference lines on the chart? If so, horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  7. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific place (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally instead of vertically?

  9. Are there any additional data points or statistics you would like to display
  on the chart (e.g., mean, median)?

  10. Would you like to include any textual description or insights directly on the
  chart?'
