initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to obesity levels and health. I want to create
  a scatter plot to visualize this data. Specifically, I want to plot "Height" on
  the x-axis and "Weight" on the y-axis. Additionally, I want to differentiate between
  genders using different colors, and use different markers to indicate "family_history_with_overweight."
  Can you please create this scatter plot for me? Make sure to include a legend to
  interpret the colors and markers, and ensure the chart is labeled with proper titles
  and axis labels. Thank you!
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate between
  genders?

  3. Are there specific marker shapes you would like to use for indicating "family_history_with_overweight"?

  4. Would you prefer to have gridlines on the chart? If yes, would you prefer gridlines
  for both axes or just one?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the axis labels and
  chart title?

  6. Is there any specific range or scale you would like to be applied to the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  7. Would you like to include any specific additional annotations or labels on certain
  data points?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  9. Are there any specific aspects or trends you would like the chart to emphasize
  apart from the already mentioned requirements?'
