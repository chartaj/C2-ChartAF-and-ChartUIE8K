initial_prompt: Create a box chart using the provided data format to visualize the
  distribution of total bill amounts segmented by the day of the week. Highlight key
  statistics such as median, quartiles, and any potential outliers. Include data-driven
  text annotations for the highest and lowest total bill amounts to draw attention
  to these points. The chart should help in understanding spending patterns on different
  days. Additionally, ensure the boxplot differentiates data points by color to reflect
  the smoker status, adding a layer of context for social-science research purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating smoker status?

  2. Would you like the box chart to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or format for the text annotations (e.g., font
  size, color)?

  4. Should the outliers be marked with specific symbols (e.g., dots, stars)?

  5. Do you want each box to be labeled with its corresponding day of the week?

  6. Are there any particular dimensions or aspect ratio you prefer for the box chart?

  7. Would you prefer the box chart to have a legend explaining the color scheme for
  smoker status?

  8. Should the chart include any additional statistical lines (e.g., mean line) other
  than those mentioned?

  9. Is there a specific way you want the whiskers to be calculated or displayed?

  10. Would you prefer the median line in each box to be highlighted or styled differently?'
