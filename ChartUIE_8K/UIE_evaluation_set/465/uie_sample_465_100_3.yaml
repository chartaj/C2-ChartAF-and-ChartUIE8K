initial_prompt: I have a dataset with information on total bills and tips at a restaurant,
  including details about the customer such as sex, smoking status, day of the week,
  and meal time. Please create a grouped bar chart that shows the average total bill
  and tip amounts for each day of the week, separated by sex. This will help visualize
  how spending habits vary by day and gender. Make sure the x-axis has the days of
  the week and the y-axis shows the amounts in dollars. The groups should distinguish
  between male and female customers. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  between male and female customers?

  2. Would you like the average total bill and tip amounts to be displayed on the
  bars?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to clearly identify male and female categories?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier readability of values?

  6. Is there a particular format or style you prefer for the title of the chart?

  7. Would you like to include error bars to show variability in the data?

  8. Do you have any preference for the order in which days of the week should be
  displayed on the x-axis?'
