initial_prompt: Please create a histogram highlighting the distribution of 'total_bill'
  from the data, with bars color-coded by the 'sex' column to emphasize the differences
  between male and female observations. The x-axis should represent the total bill
  amount, while the y-axis should show the frequency. Additionally, include text annotations
  displaying the exact total bill values for the top three highest frequency bars
  to guide the viewer's focus towards these significant data points. This visualization
  will help examine spending patterns based on gender. Ensure the chart is visually
  appealing and informative.
