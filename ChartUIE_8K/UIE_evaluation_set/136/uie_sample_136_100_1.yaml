initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the average glucose levels among different
  age groups for stroke patients. Use highlights to distinguish age groups with higher
  glucose levels. Add text annotations displaying the average glucose levels on the
  bars. Highlight insights around glucose levels to focus attention on key health
  risks. This practical visualization helps in understanding stroke risk factors and
  is part of a health dataset aimed at stroke prediction. Include context like work
  type and smoking status in the chart's narrative.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for highlighting age groups
  with higher glucose levels?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be categorized (e.g., specific age ranges)?

  3. Are there specific colors you want for text annotations on the bars?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend to explain color highlights and
  annotations?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement of text annotations (e.g., inside
  or above the bars)?

  6. Is there any specific context or narrative text you would like to include about
  work type and smoking status?

  7. How detailed should the context about work type and smoking status beâ€”just general
  trends or specific statistics?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know, maybe common five or ten-year ranges?

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like the chart to include a legend.

  5. Inside the bars would be nice, but I''m not sure.

  6. General trends about work type and smoking status would be good.

  7. Just general trends are fine.'
