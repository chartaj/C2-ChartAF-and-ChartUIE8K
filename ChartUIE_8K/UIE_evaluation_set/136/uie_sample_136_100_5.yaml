initial_prompt: I want a line chart to visualize trends related to stroke data in
  the health dataset. Specifically, plot 'age' on the x-axis and 'avg_glucose_level'
  on the y-axis, with different lines for each 'smoking_status' category. Also, include
  data points for 'bmi' as markers on this line. Make sure all missing data is handled
  appropriately and denote any significant trends or patterns. This will help us visually
  understand the relationship between age, glucose levels, BMI, and smoking status
  in relation to stroke occurrences.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for different ''smoking_status''
  categories?

  2. How would you like the missing ''bmi'' data to be imputed or indicated on the
  chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific marker style for data points representing ''bmi''?

  4. Are there any specific labels, annotations, or titles you would like to include
  on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preference for the chart''s axis scales (linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Would you like to highlight significant trends or patterns in a specific way
  (e.g., with arrows, labels)?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, any specific placement for it?

  8. Are there any thresholds or reference lines you would like to add to the chart
  (e.g., ideal avg_glucose_level)?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or context on the chart
  (e.g., data source, date)?'
