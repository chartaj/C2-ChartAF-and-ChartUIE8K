initial_prompt: Visualize the Stroke Prediction Dataset using a box plot to display
  the distribution of 'age' and 'avg_glucose_level' against 'stroke'. Highlight the
  differences between those who have had a stroke and those who haven't by adjusting
  the color of the boxes. Annotate key values for age and glucose levels where deviations
  are significant. This will help in identifying the correlation between stroke, age,
  and glucose levels, providing insights into how these factors contribute to stroke
  incidences. Including these annotations aids in quickly pinpointing areas of interest
  within the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the differences
  between those who have had a stroke and those who haven''t?

  2. Would you like to add any specific annotations or labels for the key values of
  age and glucose levels, or should it be automatically determined based on the data?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for the box plots, such as classic, minimalist,
  or any other specific design?

  4. Do you want to include any descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median) directly
  in the visualization for age and glucose levels?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, or do you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to be used for annotations
  and labels?

  7. Would you like to include axis titles and a legend, and if so, do you have any
  specific text or formatting preferences for them?

  8. Should the chart have specific dimensions (height and width) or aspect ratios
  for optimal viewing?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure; automatic determination based on the data is fine.

  3. Minimalist style would be preferred.

  4. Yes, please include mean and median for age and glucose levels.

  5. A cleaner look without grid lines would be nice.

  6. I do not know; standard font styles and sizes are fine.

  7. Yes, include axis titles and a legend. No specific text or formatting preferences.

  8. I am not sure; any dimensions for optimal viewing will work.'
