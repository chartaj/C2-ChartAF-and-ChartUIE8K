initial_prompt: I have a dataset of SAT scores for various schools. Please create
  a heatmap that displays the average scores across schools for different sections
  (Critical Reading, Mathematics, and Writing). Each school's average score should
  be presented on the heatmap, allowing us to easily compare performance across schools
  and sections. Highlight the schools with the highest and lowest overall averages.
  Ensure the chart is clear, with a legend explaining the color scale, and labels
  for schools and score types. This will help visualize areas needing improvement
  and schools excelling.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have any specific preference for how the schools with the highest and
  lowest overall averages should be highlighted?

  3. Would you like specific ranges or exact values displayed on the color scale legend?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the labels for schools and score
  types (horizontal or vertical)?

  5. Are there any specific font types or sizes that you prefer for the labels and
  legend text?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. Exact values displayed on the color scale legend.

  4. Horizontal labels for schools and vertical labels for score types.

  5. I do not know.'
