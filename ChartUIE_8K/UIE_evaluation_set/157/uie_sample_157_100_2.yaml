initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the SAT exam results with the focus on
  the 'Number of Test Takers' and the 'Critical Reading Mean' scores for each school.
  Highlight schools with high 'Critical Reading Mean' scores to draw attention to
  top performers. Utilize text annotations to show exact scores for a few top and
  bottom schools. This visualization aims to provide a comparative view of school
  performance in critical reading, helping identify patterns and outliers in education
  quality. The treemap should be color-coded to easily distinguish between different
  performance levels across the schools.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between different
  performance levels?

  2. How many top and bottom schools would you like to have text annotations for?

  3. Is there a specific color you would like to use for highlighting schools with
  high ''Critical Reading Mean'' scores?

  4. Should each schoolâ€™s ''Number of Test Takers'' be represented by the size of
  the rectangles in the treemap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. Would you like to include labels for each school on the treemap itself, or is
  a legend sufficient?

  7. Are there any specific schools that you definitely want to include in the text
  annotations regardless of their score?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, maybe the top 5 and bottom 5 schools.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the size of the rectangles should represent the ''Number of Test Takers.''

  5. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  6. Labels for each school on the treemap would be good.

  7. I do not have any specific schools in mind for text annotations.'
