initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Mathematics
  Mean and Critical Reading Mean SAT scores for schools. Highlight top and bottom
  5% schools. Add annotations for outliers. Emphasize schools with highest and lowest
  test takers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme or specific colors to
  be used for highlighting the top and bottom 5% of schools?

  2. Do you have a preferred style or format for the annotations for the outliers
  (e.g., arrow, label, tooltip)?

  3. Would you like to use different symbols or shapes to distinguish schools with
  the highest and lowest number of test takers?

  4. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like a legend included in the chart to explain the highlights and symbols
  used?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size of the points in the scatter plot, possibly
  based on the number of test takers?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for text elements
  like titles and annotations?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the chart (e.g., square,
  rectangular)?

  9. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot, and if so, do you
