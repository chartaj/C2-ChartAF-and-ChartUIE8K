initial_prompt: I'd like a grouped bar chart visualizing the SAT scores from the provided
  dataset. The chart should have the 'School Name' on the x-axis grouped by 'Critical
  Reading Mean,' 'Mathematics Mean,' and 'Writing Mean' for each school. Each bar
  group represents a school with different colored bars for each SAT category (Reading,
  Mathematics, Writing). This will help compare the average SAT scores across multiple
  schools at once. Please ensure the y-axis represents the scores, and label the schools
  clearly for understanding. Including sample schools like 'Henry Street School for
  International Studies,' 'University Neighborhood High School,' and 'East Side Community
  High School' would be great.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the bars representing ''Critical
  Reading Mean'', ''Mathematics Mean'', and ''Writing Mean''?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and title?

  4. Should the sample schools be highlighted or differentiated in any way?

  5. Do you prefer a legend to identify each SAT category, and if so, where would
  you like it positioned?

  6. Is there a specific order you want the schools to be displayed on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical, by score)?

  7. Would you like to include error bars or data labels on top of each bar to show
  exact values?'
