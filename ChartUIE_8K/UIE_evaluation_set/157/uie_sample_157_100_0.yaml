initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the SAT scores for selected schools
  over time. Use data from different school years to show trends in test performance,
  focusing on "Critical Reading Mean," "Mathematics Mean," and "Writing Mean." Add
  text annotations for standout points where scores are highest or lowest, drawing
  attention to significant changes. Use highlights to differentiate between the three
  subjects. Ensure the chart emphasizes how different schools have improved or declined
  in performance, aiming to provide insights into the effectiveness of educational
  strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for each subject (Critical Reading,
  Mathematics, Writing) in the line chart?

  2. Would you prefer a particular layout or style for the text annotations used to
  highlight standout points?

  3. Are there specific schools you want to be prominently featured or highlighted
  in the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the time intervals shown on the x-axis (e.g.,
  yearly, semester)?

  5. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the chart to follow (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed, corporate)?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend placement and style?

  7. Are there any other data points or metrics you want included or excluded from
  the chart?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines or any other background elements to assist
  in reading the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for chart labels and titles?

  10. Are there specific threshold values or benchmarks for the scores that you would
  like to highlight on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific colors for each subject.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the text annotations layout or style.

  3. I do not know which specific schools to highlight.

  4. Yearly intervals for the time axis would be good.

  5. I prefer a minimalist style for the chart.

  6. I do not have specific requirements for the legend placement and style.

  7. No additional metrics need to be included.

  8. Including gridlines would be helpful.

  9. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  10. I do not have specific threshold values or benchmarks for the scores.'
