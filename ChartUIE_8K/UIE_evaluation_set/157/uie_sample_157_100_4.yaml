initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map displaying the average SAT scores for
  each school district. Use the 'DBN' to identify the locations and plot the 'Critical
  Reading Mean', 'Mathematics Mean', and 'Writing Mean' scores on the map. Ensure
  that you represent the mean scores with different colors to visualize the differences
  across school districts effectively. Also, include a legend to differentiate the
  various score ranges. This visualization will help in understanding the geographic
  distribution of SAT performance within the district. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing the different
  score ranges?

  2. What specific ranges or thresholds would you like to see in the legend to differentiate
  the various score levels?

  3. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the map for better clarity?

  4. Should the map include boundaries for individual school districts, or any additional
  geographical context?

  5. Are there any specific formatting or design elements you would like to see in
  the legend?

  6. Would you like the map to display mean scores for each school district on hover
  or as static labels?

  7. Is there a particular map projection or base map style that you prefer for this
  visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the specific ranges or thresholds for the legend.

  3. I am not sure about specific annotations or labels.

  4. Yes, please include boundaries for individual school districts.

  5. I have no specific preference for the formatting or design elements of the legend.

  6. Static labels for the mean scores on the map would be fine.

  7. I have no particular preference for the map projection or base map style.'
