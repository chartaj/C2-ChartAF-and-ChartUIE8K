initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset about SAT scores from different high schools, including
  the number of test takers and mean scores for critical reading, mathematics, and
  writing. I would like a box plot to visualize the distribution of scores across
  these subjects. The y-axis should represent the SAT scores (ranging from 200 to
  800) and the x-axis should have the three subjects: Critical Reading, Mathematics,
  and Writing. This will help in comparing their score distributions and identifying
  any outliers or variations among the different high schools. Please ensure the box
  plots are well-labeled for clarity.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Would you like to highlight outliers with different colors or markers?

  3. Should the whiskers of the box plot represent a specific percentile range (e.g.,
  1.5 times the interquartile range)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific labeling style for the axes and the chart title?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better visual reference? If yes, in which
  direction (horizontal, vertical, both)?

  6. How would you like the mean scores to be indicated on the box plots (e.g., with
  a dot, line)?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and titles?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the various elements
  (e.g., outliers, mean, quartiles)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, highlighting outliers with different colors or markers would be helpful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, gridlines would be useful. I am not sure which direction.

  6. Indicating the mean scores with a dot would be great.

  7. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  8. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.'
