initial_prompt: Visualize the SAT performance of different schools using a scatter
  plot. Plot each school with 'Number of Test Takers' on the x-axis and the average
  of 'Critical Reading Mean,' 'Mathematics Mean,' and 'Writing Mean' on the y-axis.
  Annotate the top 5 schools with the highest scores to highlight them. Use colors
  to differentiate between schools. The purpose is to identify high-performing schools
  and understand the distribution of test scores among different schools. This visualization
  will aid educators in identifying trends and making data-driven decisions to improve
  educational outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to differentiate between
  schools?

  2. How would you like the top 5 schools with the highest scores to be annotated
  (e.g., labels, symbols)?

  3. Would you prefer a specific shape or marker style for the scatter plot points?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the annotations and
  axis labels?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the grid lines or background color of
  the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors used for different schools,
  and if so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Are there any other specific elements or styling preferences you would like to
  see on the chart?'
