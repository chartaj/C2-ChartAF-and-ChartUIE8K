initial_prompt: Create a box plot for 'Critical Reading Mean', 'Mathematics Mean',
  and 'Writing Mean' scores from the College Exam Results (SAT) dataset. This will
  help visualize the distribution and identify any outliers in the scores.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box plot?

  2. Would you like individual data points to be plotted alongside the box plots for
  better outlier visualization?

  3. Do you prefer to have notches in the box plots to depict the confidence interval
  around the median?

  4. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  text you would like to be used?

  5. Do you want a grid in the background of the plot for easier reading of values?

  6. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text elements
  in the chart?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the box plot to highlight
  key values or outliers?

  8. Do you need a legend on the plot, given that we are only visualizing three attributes?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you would like the attributes (''Critical
  Reading Mean'', ''Mathematics Mean'', ''Writing Mean'') to appear on the box plot?'
