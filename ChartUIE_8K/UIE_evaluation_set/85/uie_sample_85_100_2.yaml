initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the "Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019" dataset,
  focusing on attributes like Beats Per Minute, Energy, Danceability, Loudness (dB),
  and Popularity across different genres. Use text annotations to highlight popular
  songs and high-energy tracks. Highlight specific tracks with standout features like
  high danceability or unusual loudness. The purpose is to quickly identify patterns
  or correlations in song characteristics, and the practical use is for music enthusiasts
  and analysts to explore popular 2019 songs. Add non-data-driven annotations to provide
  context on genre popularity and song lengths.
