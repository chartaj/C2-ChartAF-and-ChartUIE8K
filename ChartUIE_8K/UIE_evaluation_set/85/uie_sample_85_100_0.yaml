initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the "Popularity"
  of the top 50 Spotify songs in 2019. Annotate the bins with text labels indicating
  the number of songs in each bin, highlighting the ranges with the most and least
  popular songs to emphasize trends. This will help us quickly identify how popularity
  is spread among these top tracks and spot any patterns or outliers in the distribution.
