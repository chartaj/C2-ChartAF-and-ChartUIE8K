initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart visualizing the genres of the top 50 Spotify
  songs of 2019. Each slice should represent a different genre, and the size of each
  slice should correspond to the number of songs in that genre. Include labels for
  the genres and the percentage they represent of the total. This should help in understanding
  the most popular genres of 2019 at a glance. Make sure it's colorful and easy to
  read.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart slices?

  2. Are there any particular fonts you would like used for the labels?

  3. Would you prefer the genre labels to be inside or outside the pie chart slices?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the genres (e.g., alphabetical,
  by percentage)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend alongside the pie chart, or should all information
  be within the chart itself?

  6. Do you prefer a 2D or 3D pie chart?

  7. How important is the readability of smaller slices to you, and would you like
  to emphasize any particular genres?

  8. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?'
