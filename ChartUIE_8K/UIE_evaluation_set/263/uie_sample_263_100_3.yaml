initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of "discovery_year"
  values from the NASA Exoplanets dataset. This will help us understand the frequency
  of exoplanet discoveries over the years. Make sure to label the x-axis as "Discovery
  Year" and the y-axis as "Frequency of Discoveries." Use distinct bars for each year
  to clearly see the trends. The title of the histogram should be "Distribution of
  Exoplanet Discoveries Over the Years." Add a legend if necessary to ensure clarity.
  This visualization will provide insights into how exoplanet discovery efforts have
  evolved over time.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the histogram?\n\
  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?\n\
  3. Do you have a specific font style and size preference for the axis labels and\
  \ title?\n4. Should the histogram include data labels showing the exact frequency\
  \ values on the bars?\n5. Do you have a preference for the number of bins or any\
  \ specific bin width?\n6. Would you like the x-axis to display every year, or can\
  \ it be grouped by intervals (e.g., every 5 years)?\n7. Do you prefer vertical or\
  \ horizontal alignment for the x-axis labels? \n8. Should the legend include any\
  \ specific information, or should we omit it if not necessary?\n9. Do you have a\
  \ particular layout or positioning preference for the title and legend?\n10. Would\
  \ you like to use any specific formatting for displaying large numbers on the y-axis\
  \ (e.g., in thousands or scientific notation)?"
