initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize NASA Exoplanets data, showing
  discovery year on the x-axis and stacking planet types on the y-axis. Highlight
  years with high discoveries and use text annotations for significant values. Emphasize
  differences in detection methods with colors or patterns to compare how methods
  vary over years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  detection methods?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like to include any specific titles for the axes and the chart?

  4. Are there any specific years you would like to highlight in the chart?

  5. Do you have a preference for the pattern styles (e.g., stripes, dots) used to
  differentiate detection methods?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where do you prefer it to be located?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  9. Do you prefer a particular order for stacking the planet types on the y-axis?

  10. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to include in
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t know.

  3. Maybe something like "Discovery Year" for the x-axis and "Number of Planets by
  Type" for the y-axis. For the chart title, "NASA Exoplanets Discoveries by Year
  and Planet Type".

  4. Highlight significant years with high discoveries, such as 2014, 2016, and 2018.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. Maybe at the bottom of the chart.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, include gridlines. Standard style is fine.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Include text annotations for the significant years mentioned with high discoveries.'
