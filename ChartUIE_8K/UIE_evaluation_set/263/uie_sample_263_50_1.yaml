initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing discovery years of exoplanets versus their
  distances, using stellar magnitudes to color-code the data points. Include text
  annotations for outliers, and highlight planets detected by Radial Velocity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific color palette to use for
  color-coding stellar magnitudes?

  2. Would you like a specific format or style for the text annotations on outliers?

  3. How would you prefer the planets detected by Radial Velocity to be highlighted
  (e.g., different marker shapes, border colors, etc.)?

  4. Is there a particular range or bin size you would like for the heatmap axes (discovery
  year and distance)?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like for the heatmap, axes,
  and legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines or any other reference lines on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred size or font for the annotations and labels on the heatmap?'

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Different marker shapes would be fine.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I have no specific preference.
