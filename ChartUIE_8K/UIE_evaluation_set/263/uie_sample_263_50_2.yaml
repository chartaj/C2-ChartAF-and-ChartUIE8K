initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the discovery years of exoplanets,
  with stacks showing different detection methods. Highlight the most frequent planet
  type and detection method in annotations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the detection methods?

  2. Do you want the chart to display data labels for each segment of the stacked
  bar?

  3. How would you like the most frequent planet type and detection method to be highlighted
  in annotations (e.g., text size, color, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer the x-axis to be in chronological order or grouped by another factor?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Should the legend placement be at a specific location on the chart (e.g., top,
  right, bottom, left)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or markers you wish to include to convey
  key insights?'
