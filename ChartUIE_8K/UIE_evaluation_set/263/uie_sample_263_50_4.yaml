initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing exoplanet discovery distribution
  by distance. Use distances from the given dataset. Highlight regions with multiple
  discoveries for NASA Exoplanets.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to display any specific labels or annotations on certain regions
  with multiple discoveries?

  5. Would you like to include a title and description on the map? If so, what should
  they be?

  6. How should the distances be categorized or segmented (e.g., specific intervals)?

  7. Should we highlight specific discovery years or ranges of years?

  8. Do you prefer any gridlines or specific divisions on the map to improve readability?

  9. Are there any particular geographic regions you would like to emphasize or focus
  on?

  10. Do you have a preferred font style and size for any text displayed on the map?'
