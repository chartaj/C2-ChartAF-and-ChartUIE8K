initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the NASA Exoplanets data. Plot
  the 'orbital_radius' on the x-axis and 'mass_multiplier' on the y-axis. Different
  colors should represent different 'planet_type'. Each point should be sized according
  to the 'stellar_magnitude'. Please ensure that the plot highlights the 'discovery_year'
  using a gradient color scale. Lastly, add appropriate labels and a legend to clarify
  the data points and their corresponding variables.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating the ''planet_type''?

  2. What type of gradient color scale would you like for representing the ''discovery_year''
  (e.g., sequential, diverging)?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the size range of the data points based
  on ''stellar_magnitude''?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot?

  5. Do you prefer the scatter plot to have a specific theme (e.g., dark, light, classic)?

  6. Are there any specific titles or axis labels you would like to use for the plot?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  8. Should the legend be placed at a specific position on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  9. Do you want to include any annotations or markers for specific data points?

  10. Is there a specific format for the axis scales (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Sequential.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please.

  5. Light theme.

  6. Title: "NASA Exoplanets Scatter Plot"; X-axis: "Orbital Radius (AU)"; Y-axis:
  "Mass Multiplier (Jupiter Masses)".

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Top-right.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Linear.'
