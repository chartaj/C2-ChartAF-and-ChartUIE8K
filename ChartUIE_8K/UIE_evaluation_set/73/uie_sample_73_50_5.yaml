initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the distribution of 'tcp_packets', 'udp_packets',
  'dist_port_tcp', and 'external_ips' across different apps ('name') to analyze network
  traffic patterns in Android malware and benign traffic.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference on the color scheme for the heatmap (e.g.,
  sequential, diverging, specific colorblind-friendly palette)?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the heatmap to distinguish between different
  apps and packet counts?

  3. Should there be a legend explaining the color gradients used in the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer any specific labeling for the axes, such as ''App Names'' for the
  y-axis and ''Traffic Metrics'' for the x-axis?

  5. Would you like to include any data labels showing the exact values of ''tcp_packets'',
  ''udp_packets'', ''dist_port_tcp'', and ''external_ips'' within each cell?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., vertical,
  horizontal, square)?

  7. Would you like to highlight any specific ranges of values within the heatmap
  for quick visual identification?

  8. Do you prefer a specific order for displaying the apps (e.g., alphabetical, based
  on total traffic)?

  9. Should the heatmap include any annotations or additional information for context,
  like separating malware and benign apps?

  10. Do you want to set any thresholds for color intensity to emphasize higher traffic
  patterns more prominently?'
