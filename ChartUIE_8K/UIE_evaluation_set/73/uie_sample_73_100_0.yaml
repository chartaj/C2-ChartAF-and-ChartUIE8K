initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to compare the 'avg_local_pkt_rate' across different
  'external_ips' names. Highlight data points to emphasize high and low packet rates.
  Annotate 3-4 highest and lowest values to draw clear insights into the 'avg_local_pkt_rate'
  distribution. Use different colors to visually distinguish the highlighted bars.
  This will help in analyzing how external IP interactions influence local packet
  rates and potentially identify unusual patterns related to network security and
  Android malware behaviors. Ensure the chart is easily interpretable for cybersecurity
  analysis, focusing on the traffic behavior of Android devices.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting the high and
  low packet rates?

  2. Would you like to see any specific labels or legends to accompany the different
  colors used for highlighting?

  3. How would you prefer the annotations for the highest and lowest values to be
  displayed? For example, should they include specific text or symbols?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Should there be any specific order of the bars (e.g., sorted by packet rates,
  alphabetical by external IPs)?

  6. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the axes labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability
  of the bar chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  9. Should there be a specific title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?

  10. Is there any additional information or details you would like to be included
  in tooltips when hovering over the bars?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Specific text annotations would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Sorting the bars by packet rates would be useful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for font style and size.

  9. Title the chart "Comparison of Avg Local Packet Rates by External IPs".

  10. I do not know.'
