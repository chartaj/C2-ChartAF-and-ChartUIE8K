initial_prompt: I need a stacked area chart visualizing urban and rural population
  percentages over years. Highlight years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 with text annotations
  showing exact values for those years. The focus should be on the trend differences
  between urban and rural areas over time. This visualization will help understand
  the urbanization rate and how rural populations have changed. The context is agriculture
  and farming, so the chart should emphasize these aspects for better insight into
  population shifts impacting agricultural areas.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing urban and
  rural areas?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for easier value reading, or do you prefer
  it without them for a cleaner look?

  3. Would you like the text annotations for the highlighted years to have specific
  formatting (font size, color, bold, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer the x-axis and y-axis to have specific labels or titles?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have a preference for its
  placement?

  6. Do you want any particular style for highlighting the years 2000, 2005, 2010,
  and 2015 (e.g., vertical lines, markers)?

  7. Is there a specific way you''d like to display or emphasize the overall trend
  differences between urban and rural populations on the chart?

  8. Would you like the chart background to be in a specific color or style to align
  with the context of agriculture and farming?'
