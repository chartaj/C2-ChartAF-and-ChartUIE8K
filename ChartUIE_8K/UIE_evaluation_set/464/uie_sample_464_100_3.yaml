initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart to compare Urban and Rural population percentages
  over the years 2000 to 2016, based on the provided dataset. Label the x-axis as
  "Year" and the y-axis as "Population Percentage." Ensure the chart has two distinct
  lines: one for Urban and one for Rural areas. Include a legend for clarity. The
  chart should offer a visual representation of how urbanization is progressing over
  time and its impact on rural regions. Use different colors for each line and make
  them easily distinguishable. The title of the chart should be "Urban vs Rural Population
  Trends (2000-2016)."'
