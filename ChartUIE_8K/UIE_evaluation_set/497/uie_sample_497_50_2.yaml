initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize processor transistor counts over
  time. Highlight key processors to emphasize major advancements. Annotate significant
  data points for better understanding. Use colors to distinguish designer companies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing designer companies?

  2. What specific processors would you like to highlight as major advancements?

  3. How would you prefer significant data points to be annotated (e.g., text labels,
  symbols)?

  4. Are there any specific time intervals or date ranges you would like to emphasize?

  5. Do you have a preference for the style and format of the line chart (e.g., solid,
  dashed lines)?

  6. Should any additional information be included in the annotations, such as brief
  descriptions or statistics?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for text annotations and labels?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, what should
  they be?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement or style on the chart?

  10. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you have a specific style
  or color in mind?'
