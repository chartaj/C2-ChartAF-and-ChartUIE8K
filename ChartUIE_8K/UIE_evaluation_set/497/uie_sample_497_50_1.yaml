questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the Intel processors to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  bold outlines)?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  4. Do you want the transistor count annotations to be placed inside or outside the
  bars?

  5. Is there a particular style or formatting you prefer for the text annotation
  about the 1971 Intel 4004 processor?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the bar chart?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  8. Do you want a legend to differentiate Intel processors from others, or will the
  highlighting be enough?'
