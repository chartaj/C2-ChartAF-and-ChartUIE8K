initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the transistor count of processors
  over the years. Break down by designer, and process node.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the designers and process
  nodes in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the years to be displayed on the X-axis or Y-axis?

  3. How would you like to handle the missing values for transistor count and process
  node?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to display the exact numbers or percentages for each
  segment in the bars?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included on the bars
  or axes?

  6. Do you desire a legend to differentiate the segments by designer and process
  node, and where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want for the chart and axes?'
