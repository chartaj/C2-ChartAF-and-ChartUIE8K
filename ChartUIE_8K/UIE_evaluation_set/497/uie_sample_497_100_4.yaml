initial_prompt: I would like a scatter plot visualizing the introduction date and
  transistor count of various processors over time. Please plot the 'date_of_introduction'
  on the x-axis and 'transistor_count' on the y-axis. Differentiate points by 'designer'
  to see which companies were leading innovations during different years. It's important
  to have data points clearly marked, possibly with different colors or shapes for
  each designer to make the trends more visible. Also, please handle the missing values
  appropriately to ensure the completeness of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the designers?

  2. Are there specific shapes you would like to use for each designer?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be handled? Would you prefer imputation
  or excluding those data points?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Do you want data labels or tooltips for each data point to show exact values?

  6. Would you prefer a logarithmic scale for the y-axis to better visualize changes
  in transistor counts?

  7. Is there a specific range of dates you are most interested in highlighting on
  the x-axis?

  8. Do you have any preference for the size of the data points to indicate importance
  or frequency?

  9. Should there be a legend to clearly identify the colors or shapes used for each
  designer?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Excluding those data points.

  4. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, a logarithmic scale for the y-axis would be good.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, there should be a legend to identify the colors or shapes used for each
  designer.'
