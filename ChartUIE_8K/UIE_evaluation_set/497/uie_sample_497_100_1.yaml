initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the "processor" (x-axis) against "transistor_count"
  (y-axis). Highlight significant processors with the highest transistor counts. Annotate
  with text to display the transistor counts of these highlighted processors. Add
  a note if any data points are missing. This is intended to track the evolution of
  processors over time and identify major technological advancements. Ensure that
  the chart is clear and visually distinguishes key data points effectively. Use distinct
  colors for the highlighted processors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How many significant processors would you like to highlight with distinct colors?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used for annotations?

  4. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the note about missing data
  points?

  5. Do you want the highlighted processors to be in a particular order or sequence
  on the chart?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines or any other specific background elements
  to enhance readability?

  7. Do you want a legend included to explain the colors used for the highlighted
  processors?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the axis labels or any additional formatting
  for the axes?

  9. Would you like the bars to be of a certain width or have any particular style
  (e.g., solid, patterned)?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Four or five significant processors.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. A simple note at the bottom would be fine.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful for readability.

  7. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.

  8. No specific preferences for axis labels or formatting.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Title: "Evolution of Processor Transistor Counts Over Time"'
