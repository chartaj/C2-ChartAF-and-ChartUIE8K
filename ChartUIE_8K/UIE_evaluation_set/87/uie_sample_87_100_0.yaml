initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing key metrics from the League of Legends
  Diamond Ranked Games (10 min). Plot the time series of blue and red teams' total
  gold and average level over time. Annotate significant events such as first blood
  and the number of elite monsters captured. Highlight gold and experience differences
  with annotations to compare team performance. Use shape annotations like arrows
  to emphasize important events or patterns in the data. This visualization will help
  analyze team dynamics and strategic advantages during the early game phase.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between the
  blue and red teams?

  2. Would you like specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) to differentiate between
  the total gold and average level metrics?

  3. Are there any specific formats or styles for annotations (e.g., font size, color)
  that you prefer?

  4. How would you like significant events (e.g., first blood, elite monsters) to
  be annotated on the chart (e.g., text labels, icons)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of shape annotations like
  arrows to emphasize important events?

  6. Would you like grid lines or background shading to be included in the chart to
  enhance readability?

  7. How would you prefer to highlight the gold and experience differences (e.g.,
  shaded areas between lines, distinct markers)?

  8. Are there any specific time intervals (e.g., every minute) you would like on
  the x-axis for the time series plot?

  9. Do you want to include a legend on the chart? If yes, where would you like it
  to be positioned?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like solid lines for total gold and dashed lines for average level.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Text labels would be good for significant events like first blood and elite monsters.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, include grid lines to enhance readability.

  7. Shaded areas between lines to highlight gold and experience differences would
  be great.

  8. Every minute would be fine for the time intervals on the x-axis.

  9. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be positioned.'
