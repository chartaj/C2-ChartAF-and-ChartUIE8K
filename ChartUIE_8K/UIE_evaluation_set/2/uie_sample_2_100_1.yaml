initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing methane (CH4) emissions from 1990
  to 2018 for China and Russia. Highlight significant emission trends and add text
  annotations for key years (e.g., highest and lowest emissions). Ensure the chart
  draws attention to critical data points while blending with the overall trend. This
  will help us understand temporal changes in methane emissions, compare emission
  levels between the two countries, and identify pivotal moments in the data. The
  chart should be titled "Methane Emissions Around The World (1990-2018)" for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like specific line styles or markers to differentiate between China
  and Russia?

  3. Do you have a preference for the placement and formatting of the annotations
  for key years?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines or background shading to make trends easier
  to identify?

  5. What level of detail would you prefer for the axis labels (e.g., annual, every
  five years)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart title and labels?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  8. Are there any specific statistical or trend lines you would like to be added
  (e.g., moving average, trend line fit)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include grid lines to make trends easier to identify.

  5. Every five years would be fine.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend. Position it at the bottom right.

  8. I do not know.'
