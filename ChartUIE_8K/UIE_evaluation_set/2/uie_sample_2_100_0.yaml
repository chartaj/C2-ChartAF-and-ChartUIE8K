initial_prompt: I need a grouped column chart visualizing methane emissions (CH4)
  from 1990 to 2018 for both China and Russia. Each bar should represent a year, grouped
  by country. The chart should highlight the emissions for several selected years
  (e.g., 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018) to show critical changes over time. Annotations
  should include the actual emission values for these highlighted years. This will
  help to compare the trends of methane emissions between the two countries, focusing
  particularly on the selected years for quick insight into the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the bars representing China and
  Russia?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between the two countries?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font type or size for the annotations of the actual
  emission values?

  4. Should the highlighted yearsâ€™ bars be in a different color or have any special
  markings to indicate their importance?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for easier comparison of values?

  6. Is there a particular title or headline you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the y-axis scale to be linear or logarithmic?

  8. Do you want the y-axis to display the values with a specific unit (e.g., MTCO2e)?

  9. Would you like the x-axis labels to display each year sequentially, or only the
  highlighted years?

  10. Is there any specific placement or style you prefer for the annotations?'
