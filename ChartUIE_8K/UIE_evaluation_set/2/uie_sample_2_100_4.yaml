initial_prompt: I want to create a global choropleth map showing methane emissions
  by country from 1990 to 2018. Use the "Country" column for geographical data and
  the years as individual data points, such as "1990", "1991", etc., up to "2018"
  to show the emission levels. The color gradients should represent the magnitude
  of methane emissions in MTCO2e. Please make sure to include a legend to comprehend
  the color scales and provide tools for users to hover and see specific values per
  country for each year.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing methane emission
  levels?

  2. Would you like to categorize the color gradient into specific intervals or have
  a smooth gradient?

  3. Do you prefer any specific projection type for the global map (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?

  4. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to highlight?

  5. Do you want to include any additional annotations or labels on the map?

  6. How would you like the year selection to be handled (e.g., slider, dropdown menu)?

  7. Do you prefer a sequential or diverging color scheme for the choropleth map?

  8. Would you like to have a temporal animation option to visualize changes over
  the years automatically?

  9. Are there any specific legends styles or placements you prefer?

  10. Is there a maximum or minimum value of emissions that you''d like to set as
  the threshold for the color scales?'
