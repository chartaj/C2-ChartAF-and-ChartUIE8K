initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize Methane Emissions (CH4) data from 1990
  to 2018 for different countries in the dataset. Use "Country" as the y-axis and
  the years (1990-2018) as the x-axis. The intensity of the color should represent
  the amount of Methane emissions in MTCO2e. Include a legend to indicate emission
  levels. Rotate x-axis labels for better readability. Title the chart as "Global
  Methane Emissions Heatmap (1990-2018)".
questions: '1. Are there specific color schemes you prefer for indicating different
  levels of methane emissions?

  2. Do you have a preference for the range of colors used in the heatmap (e.g., gradient
  from blue to red)?

  3. Would you like to highlight any specific countries or years within the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font size or style for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include in
  the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No, no specific countries or years need to be highlighted.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No additional information or annotation is needed.'
