initial_prompt: I would like to create a heatmap to visualize how people evaluate
  our service in the business sector. The columns like "Almost Certainly," "Highly
  Likely," "Very Good Chance," and others should be on one axis, while the range of
  their values should be on the other. Each cell's color should represent the frequency
  or intensity of evaluations, helping us easily identify how likely people are to
  rate our service highly or poorly. This will give us a clear, visual overview of
  customer satisfaction levels based on different expressions of likelihood. Please
  make sure all columns are included.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include data labels to show the frequency or intensity values
  within each cell?

  3. Should the heatmap have a specific title or subtitle to provide context?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or notes you want included in the heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer a particular order for the columns on the axis, or should they
  be arranged as provided?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradient used in the
  heatmap?

  7. Do you have a specific preference for the axis labels'' font size and style?

  8. Should the heatmap be designed with any specific dimensions or aspect ratio?

  9. Would you like to have gridlines or separations between the cells in the heatmap?'
