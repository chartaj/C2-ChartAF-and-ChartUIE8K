initial_prompt: Please create a table chart to visualize the evaluation of service
  people have provided from the data. Make sure the table includes all columns such
  as "Almost Certainly," "Highly Likely," "Very Good Chance," "Probable," "Likely,"
  "Probably," "We Believe," "Better Than Even," "About Even," "We Doubt," "Improbable,"
  "Unlikely," "Probably Not," "Little Chance," "Almost No Chance," "Highly Unlikely,"
  and "Chances Are Slight." Display each column's summary including unique values,
  and some sample data for clarity. This should help us understand the overall trends
  in service evaluation better.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the table layout, such as
  the order of columns or any grouping of similar attributes?

  2. Are there any specific colors or formatting styles you prefer for highlighting
  certain data points or columns?

  3. Would you like to include additional statistics or metrics beyond unique values
  and sample data in the table, such as averages or medians?

  4. Do you want any conditional formatting to emphasize specific thresholds or ranges
  within the data?

  5. Are there any particular labels or headings you would like to use for clarity
  in the table?

  6. Would you prefer the sample data to be displayed as a separate section or integrated
  within the main table?

  7. Are there any specific tools or platforms where you intend to present this table
  (e.g., Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the number of sample data points to be shown for
  each column?'
