initial_prompt: I want to visualize how people evaluate the service provided by my
  business. Specifically, I am looking for a Box chart that represents the spread
  and central tendency of people's likelihood evaluations (e.g., 'Almost Certainly',
  'Highly Likely', etc.). Each box should show the distribution (minimum, first quartile,
  median, third quartile, and maximum) of the scores in each column from the dataset
  provided. This would help show the variability and typical score for each evaluation
  term, giving me insight into customer perceptions. Please make sure all evaluation
  terms are included in the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the Box chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the chart for easier
  comparison?

  3. Should each box plot have a specific color or pattern to differentiate between
  various evaluation terms?

  4. Do you want the chart to include mean values in addition to the quartiles and
  median?

  5. Should outliers be explicitly displayed on the Box chart, or would you prefer
  them to be hidden?

  6. Would you like labels for the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile,
  and maximum values included on the chart?

  7. Is there any specific font or style you prefer for the titles and labels on the
  chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred orientation for the Box chart (horizontal or vertical)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend explaining the different components of the
  Box chart?

  10. Should the chart include annotations or comments for any specific insights or
  values?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would like gridlines included.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, include mean values.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include the labels for the different values.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I think vertical would be better.

  9. Yes, please include a legend.

  10. I am not sure.'
