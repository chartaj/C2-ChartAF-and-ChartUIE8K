initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart that visualizes how people evaluate service
  in a business context. Use the columns representing different qualitative likelihoods
  (like "Highly Likely," "Probable," etc.) as the x-axis. For each likelihood column,
  plot the unique values on the y-axis with the corresponding data points marked by
  circles at the top of each line. Ensure all values (float64 and int64) from the
  sample data are accurately represented. This should help to compare different levels
  of service evaluation visually.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the size or thickness of the lollipop stems
  and circles?

  4. Do you want the x-axis labels to be rotated for better visibility?

  5. Is there any preferred order for the x-axis categories?

  6. Would you like to add data labels to the circles on the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to explain the different data attributes?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?

  9. Do you want to highlight any particular categories or data points?
