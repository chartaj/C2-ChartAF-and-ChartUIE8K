initial_prompt: I need a violin plot to visualize how people evaluate service quality
  in a business context. The plot should use the data columns such as 'Almost Certainly',
  'Highly Likely', 'Very Good Chance', and other similar columns that reflect different
  probabilities. Each column should represent a different category on the x-axis,
  and the y-axis should show the range of values within each category. This will help
  in understanding the distribution and variability of people's evaluations for each
  probability category. Please ensure that the plot clearly shows the density and
  spread for each category.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different categories
  in the violin plot?

  2. Would you like the plot to include any annotations to highlight key observations?

  3. Should the plot display individual data points within the distributions?

  4. Do you prefer any specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size that you would like to use for the labels
  and titles?

  6. Do you want to add a legend to the plot? If so, where would you prefer it to
  be placed?

  7. Are there any particular gridlines or background elements you would like to include
  or exclude?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to indicate specific
  thresholds or median values?

  9. How detailed would you like the density estimation to be for each category?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like the plot to display individual data points within the distributions.

  4. I prefer "Probability Categories" for the x-axis and "Evaluation Scores" for
  the y-axis.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  6. Yes, please add a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.'
