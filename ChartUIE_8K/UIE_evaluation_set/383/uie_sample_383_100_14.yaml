initial_prompt: I want to visualize how people evaluate service in a business using
  a spline chart. The x-axis should represent the different evaluation categories
  like 'Almost Certainly', 'Highly Likely', 'Very Good Chance', etc. The y-axis should
  show the numerical values of these evaluations. Use the sample data values provided,
  such as 95, 80, 75, etc., to plot the spline lines. Each evaluation category should
  have a smooth line connecting their respective data points. Please create the spline
  chart with this data to analyze how customers perceive the likelihood of different
  service outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the spline lines?

  2. Should the chart include data point markers for each evaluation category?

  3. Would you like to add a title to the chart?

  4. Do you want axis labels for both the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they
  be?

  5. Are you interested in a legend to differentiate between different data points
  or lines if there are multiple lines?

  6. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it auto-adjust based on the
  data?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or notes for specific data points?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any background shading or patterns in the chart?

  11. Are there any particular styles or themes you prefer for the overall appearance
  of the chart (e.g., modern, classic, minimalistic)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include data point markers.

  3. Yes, add a title: "Customer Evaluation of Service Likelihood".

  4. Yes, label the x-axis as "Evaluation Categories" and the y-axis as "Evaluation
  Scores".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Let the y-axis auto-adjust based on the data.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, annotations are not needed.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. No, background shading or patterns are not needed.

  11. I do not know.'
