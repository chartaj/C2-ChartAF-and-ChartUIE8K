  from the provided dataset.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  2. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for different glass types?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to identify different glass types?

  4. Do you have a preference for the arrangement of elements along the x-axis?

  5. Should the y-axis display the average concentration as absolute values or percentages?

  6. Do you prefer gridlines in the background of the chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like to add data labels to show the exact values of average concentrations
  on the bars?

  8. Do you want axis titles for both x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they be?

  9. Should there be any specific order in which the glass types are grouped?

  10. Is there any specific font style or size you would prefer for the chart text
