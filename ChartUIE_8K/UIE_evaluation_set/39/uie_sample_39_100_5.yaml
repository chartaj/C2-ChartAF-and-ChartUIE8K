initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the glass classification
  data. The x-axis should represent the different types of glass (Type 1 to Type 6),
  and the y-axis should represent the concentration of various elements (RI, Na, Mg,
  Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe). Each bar stack should be divided into segments showing the
  concentration of each element within the same type of glass. Use different colors
  to differentiate between the elements. This will help us understand the composition
  variations across different glass types. Make sure to include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the elements in the
  stacked bar chart?

  2. Do you want any specific order of the elements within each stack?

  3. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it be set to auto-scale based
  on the data?

  4. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Should there be any particular grid lines or background styles included in the
  chart?

  6. Do you want any annotations or data labels to be shown within the bar segments?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or subtitle?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or size for the legend?'
