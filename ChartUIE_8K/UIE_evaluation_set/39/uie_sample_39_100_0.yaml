initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of types in the glass
  classification dataset. Ensure the x-axis represents the different types of glass,
  and the y-axis shows the frequency of each type. The intent is to highlight how
  frequently each type occurs. Also, annotate the histogram bars with precise counts
  for clarity. This visualization will help identify the most common glass types and
  facilitate data-driven decisions in glass chemistry analysis. Use highlights to
  emphasize the most and least frequent types, making them visually distinct for easier
  interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. What styling preferences do you have for the annotations (e.g., font size, font
  color)?

  3. How would you like the highlights for the most and least frequent types to look
  (e.g., specific colors, borders)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout for the legend, if any?

  5. Should there be any specific title or subtitle for the histogram?

  6. Do you require any specific labels or descriptions on the axes?

  7. How would you like the axis ticks to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  8. Are there any specific preferences for the width of the bars in the histogram?

  9. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, what style should
  they have?

  10. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the chartâ€™s overall text elements?'
