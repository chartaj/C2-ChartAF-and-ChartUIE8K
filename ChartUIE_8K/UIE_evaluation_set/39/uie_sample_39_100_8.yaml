initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization for the provided Glass Classification
  dataset. The treemap should represent the distribution of different Types of glass.
  Each Type should be displayed as a distinct color, and the size of each segment
  should correspond to the relative frequency of that Type in the dataset. Ensure
  that each glass Type is labeled clearly. Additionally, incorporate the average values
  of key chemical components (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) within each Type
  segment for better insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different glass types?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the labels?

  3. Would you like to include tooltips or annotations for the average values of the
  chemical components?

  4. Should the average values of the chemical components be displayed within each
  segment or as a separate legend?

  5. Are there specific units or formatting you prefer for the chemical component
  values?

  6. Do you need any additional labels or information displayed on the treemap?

  7. Do you have a specific layout preference for the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  8. Would you like gridlines or borders around each segment for better distinction?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. The average values of the chemical components should be displayed within each
  segment.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
