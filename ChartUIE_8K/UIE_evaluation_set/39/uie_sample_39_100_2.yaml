initial_prompt: I have data on the classifications and chemical compositions of different
  types of glass. Can you create a column chart that shows the average values of RI,
  Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, and Fe for each Type of glass? I want to visualize how
  these chemical properties vary between different glass types. Each chemical property
  should be represented as a separate column for comparison across types. Make sure
  the chart is easy to interpret, with clear labels for each type and chemical property.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each type of glass or
  chemical property?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels showing the average values on
  each column?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and titles in the chart?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to identify each chemical property, and if
  so, where should it be positioned?

  5. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Do you prefer vertical or horizontal
  labels for the x-axis?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart to help with value interpretation? If yes,
  should they be on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you''d like the Types of glass to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  8. Would you prefer the columns to be grouped by Type of glass or by chemical property
  for easier comparison?

  9. Do you want to include any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  10. Should the y-axis be scaled to a specific range, or should it automatically
  adjust based on the data?'
