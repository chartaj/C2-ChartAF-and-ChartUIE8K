initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the data from the Hepatitis C Prediction
  Dataset. Specifically, I want to see the trend of liver enzyme levels (ALB, ALP,
  ALT, AST, GGT) over different ages. Please make the x-axis represent the Age, and
  the y-axis represent the enzyme levels. Each enzyme should have a different colored
  line for easy distinction. Ensure the chart clearly indicates what each color represents
  and make the data points visible along the lines. This should help us understand
  how enzyme levels vary with age in predicting Hepatitis C.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include a subtitle or description for the chart? If so, what
  should it say?

  3. Are there any specific color preferences for the enzyme lines?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Would you like the data points to be represented by specific markers (e.g., circles,
  squares)?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be for both axes or just
  one?

  7. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range, or should it auto-scale based on
  the data?

  8. Do you want a legend to be positioned in a specific location (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  9. Do you wish to include any trend lines or smoothing lines along with the data
  points?

  10. Should the chart include any specific annotations or callouts for key points
  or trends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, I would like the data points to be represented by circles.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be useful. Please include them for both axes.

  7. The y-axis should auto-scale based on the data.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the legend position.

  9. No, I do not wish to include any trend lines or smoothing lines.

  10. No specific annotations or callouts are needed.'
