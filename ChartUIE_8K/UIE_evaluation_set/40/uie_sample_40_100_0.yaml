initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the "Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset"
  focusing on health categories. Each rectangle should represent a category ('Category').
  Highlight and annotate critical health metrics like 'ALB', 'ALT', 'AST', and 'BIL'.
  Emphasize data points that have missing values to identify gaps. Use distinct colors
  to differentiate between 'Category' and 'Age'. This will help in quickly identifying
  the distribution and concentration of health parameters across different categories
  and age groups. Add text annotations for data points with extreme values to draw
  attention to potential outliers or significant observations in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between ''Category''
  and ''Age''?

  2. Are there specific threshold values you consider for highlighting extreme values
  in the metrics ''ALB'', ''ALT'', ''AST'', and ''BIL''?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the missing values be represented in a particular way, such as with a
  distinct pattern or color?

  5. Is there a specific layout or size for the rectangles representing each category
  that you prefer?

  6. Do you have preferences for the visual emphasis on critical health metricsâ€”bold,
  italics, or specific colors?

  7. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to be included or customized?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for integrating the age group differentiation
  within the treemap?

  9. Would you prefer any specific annotation styles for outliers and significant
  observations?

  10. Should we include any additional contextual information or tooltips when hovering
  over the data points?'
