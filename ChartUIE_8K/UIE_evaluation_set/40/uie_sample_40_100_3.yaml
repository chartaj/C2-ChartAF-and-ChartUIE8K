initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of different
  'Category' values from the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset. I want to see the proportions
  of '0=Blood Donor', '1=Hepatitis', '2=Fibrosis', '3=Cirrhosis' and '0s=suspect Blood
  Donor'. This will help in understanding the composition of the categories in the
  dataset. Ensure the chart is color-coded with a legend and the percentages are displayed
  on the slices for better clarity. The data has no missing values in 'Category',
  so it should be accurate. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the categories?

  2. Would you like to specify particular colors for each category?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style and size for the percentages displayed on
  the slices?

  4. How would you like the legend to be positioned relative to the pie chart (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart?'
