initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the distribution of patients by category,
  gender, and age. Emphasize categories with text annotations and highlight age groups
  with distinctive colors. Aim to simplify the identification of trends in liver function
  indicators within the Hepatitis C dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for highlighting different
  age groups?

  2. Would you like to use specific text annotations for the categories? If so, please
  provide the details.

  3. How would you like the gender to be represented within the treemap?

  4. Should the size of the rectangles be proportional to the number of patients in
  each category, gender, and age group?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout algorithm (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)
  for the treemap?

  6. Are there any additional liver function indicators you would like to include
  in the visualization?'
