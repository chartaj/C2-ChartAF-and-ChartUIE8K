initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trends in various JoJo
  Stands' statistics. Use columns PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, and DEV to create individual
  lines on the chart, representing different stands' abilities over these categories.
  Label the x-axis with the categories (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) and include
  a legend to differentiate between stands. Highlight missing values distinctively.
  This should give a clear visual comparison of how different stands rank across these
  attributes. Adjust the scale to accommodate all six categories appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the individual lines representing
  each stand?

  2. Would you like any specific markers or symbols at data points on the lines?

  3. Is there a preferred layout or style for highlighting missing values?

  4. Do you have specific font preferences for the axis labels, legend, or title?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the grid lines (e.g., major/minor grid lines,
  their colors)?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a particular position on the chart?

  8. Do you have specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?'
