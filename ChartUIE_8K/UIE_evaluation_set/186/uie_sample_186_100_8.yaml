initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing the stats of JoJo Stands based
  on the data provided. The chart should display the average values for PWR, SPD,
  RNG, PER, PRC, and DEV with each axis representing one of these attributes. We want
  to see how different stands compare in terms of their abilities. Use color coding
  to differentiate between the stands if possible. Make sure to handle the missing
  values appropriately. Each stand's stats should be clearly labeled on the radar
  chart. This will help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each stand
  visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different stands?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be handled? Should they be imputed,
  left as blank, or handled otherwise?

  3. Would you prefer the average values to be displayed as data labels on the radar
  chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the number of axes lines or grid lines in the radar
  chart?

  5. Would you like to include a legend for color coding in the chart?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG,
  PER, PRC, DEV) to be displayed on the radar chart?

  7. Do you have any specific font or style preferences for the labels on the chart?

  8. Are there any particular stands you want to highlight or prioritize in the visualization?'
