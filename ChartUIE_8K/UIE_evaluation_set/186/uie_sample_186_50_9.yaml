initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the distribution of JoJo Stands' attributes
  (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV). Use the counts of unique values within each attribute
  to determine the size of each section. This visualization should help in quickly
  identifying the relative frequency of different Stand attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each attribute category?

  2. Would you like any labels or tooltips to be displayed with additional details
  (e.g., exact counts) on the treemap?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for labels and titles?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout (e.g., aspect ratio) of the treemap?

  5. Would you like to include a legend explaining the colors and categories of the
  treemap?

  6. Do you have any specific title or subtitle in mind for the treemap?

  7. Are there any specific size constraints for the treemap to fit a particular space
  or medium?

  8. Do you prefer a specific format for displaying counts (e.g., percentages, raw
  counts)?
