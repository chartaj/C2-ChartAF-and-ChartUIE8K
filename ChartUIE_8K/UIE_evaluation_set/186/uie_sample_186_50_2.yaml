initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the frequency distribution of 'PWR' ratings
  in different Stands from the dataset. Highlight 'PWR' levels that appear most frequently
  to quickly identify common power levels. Add text annotations to explain peaks in
  the distribution.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the histogram?\n\
  2. Would you prefer to have the x-axis labeled with specific 'PWR' categories or\
  \ numerical values?\n3. Should the y-axis be labeled with actual counts or percentages?\n\
  4. How detailed should the text annotations be for explaining the peaks?\n5. Do\
  \ you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?\n6. Would\
  \ you like the histogram bins to be automatically determined or would you prefer\
  \ custom bin sizes?\n7. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?\n\
  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title or axis labels? \n\
  9. Is there any particular way you would like the 'PWR' levels to be highlighted\
  \ (e.g., color, bold outline, etc.)?\n10. Are there any specific stylistic preferences\
  \ to consider for the histogram (e.g., bar width, spacing between bars)?\n"
