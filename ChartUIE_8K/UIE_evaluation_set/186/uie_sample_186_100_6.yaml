initial_prompt: Create a violin plot for the JoJo Stands Stats dataset. Show the distribution
  of 'PWR', 'SPD', 'RNG', 'PER', 'PRC', and 'DEV' values across different stands.
  Each category should be a separate violin plot, allowing us to compare the bandwidth
  of ratings for each attribute. Highlight any outliers and add a color legend to
  distinguish between different stands. This will help in analyzing which attributes
  have more variation or concentration in their ratings. Ensure the violin plots are
  labeled clearly and are visually appealing for better interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the violin plots?

  2. Would you like the plots to be arranged in a specific layout (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical grid)?

  3. Are there any specific stands you would like to highlight or compare explicitly?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style for highlighting outliers (e.g., different color,
  special markers)?

  5. Should the violin plots include all existing stands or only a subset of them?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) of the
  axes?

  7. Is there any additional annotation or labeling style you prefer for clarity?

  8. How detailed should the color legend be (e.g., each stand with a unique color,
  grouping similar stands)?

  9. Should the distribution bandwidth be estimated using a specific method (e.g.,
  default, Scott’s Rule, Silverman’s Rule)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No specific stands to highlight, just compare all of them generally.

  4. Different color for outliers would be good.

  5. Please include all existing stands.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Clear labeling for each attribute and stand would be helpful.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I do not know.'
