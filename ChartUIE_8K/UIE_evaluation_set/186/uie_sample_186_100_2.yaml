initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the unique values
  for each attribute (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) from JoJo Stands Stats. Annotate
  the histogram with text highlights showing the counts of each unique value to draw
  attention to specific traits. Ensure to highlight key stand attributes by modifying
  the color scheme or size of the bars to distinguish important performance metrics.
  This chart aims to make it easier to compare the different attributes of stands
  and quickly identify which traits are more common or rare across the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used in the histogram?

  2. Would you prefer specific colors to highlight key stand attributes?

  3. How do you want the text highlights for the counts of each unique value to appear?
  (e.g., font size, color)

  4. Is there a specific way you''d like to modify the size of the bars to distinguish
  important performance metrics?

  5. What background color do you prefer for the histogram?

  6. Do you need any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  7. Should there be a legend or specific labels for each attribute? If so, what format
  should they take?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?

  9. Should the bars be grouped or stacked in any particular way?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or orientation of the histogram
  (vertical or horizontal)?'
