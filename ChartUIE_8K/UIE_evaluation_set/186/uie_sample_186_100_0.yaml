initial_prompt: Create a bar chart displaying the average missing values for each
  stat (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) from JoJo Stands Stats dataset. Annotate each
  bar with the exact average missing value to highlight data gaps. Highlight bars
  with higher missing values in a distinct color to draw attention to less complete
  data areas. This visualization will help identify which stats have the most missing
  data and need further attention for data collection efforts within the context of
  arts-and-entertainment analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting bars with higher
  missing values?

  2. Should the x-axis labels be displayed horizontally or rotated for better readability?

  3. Would you like the bar chart to include grid lines for easier comparison?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations on each bar?

  5. How important is it to include a legend that explains the distinct colors used
  in the chart?

  6. Should the y-axis display exact values or percentage values of the missing data?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the bar chart?

  8. Should there be any specific margin or padding to ensure all elements are clearly
  visible?'
