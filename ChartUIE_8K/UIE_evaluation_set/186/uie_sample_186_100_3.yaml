initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the JoJo Stands Stats from the file provided,
  focusing on the different attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) for each Stand.
  Please create a heatmap that shows the intensity of these attributes across different
  Stands. The idea is to easily compare how different Stands excel in each attribute
  by using color gradients. Ensure missing values are handled appropriately. Also,
  include a legend to make it easy to understand the heatmap. This will help in analyzing
  the strengths and weaknesses of each Stand visually. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient or specific color palette for
  the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be handled (e.g., filled with a default
  value, removed, or indicated in a specific way)?

  3. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the heatmap cells?

  4. Are there any specific Stands or attributes you want to highlight more prominently?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size and dimensions of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like the stands to be sorted or ordered in a particular way (e.g.,
  alphabetically, by a specific attribute)?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the legend and labels?

answers: '1. I am not sure; any visually appealing color gradient is fine.

  2. Please fill the missing values with a default value.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for annotations or labels on the heatmap
  cells.

  4. I do not know; no specific Stands or attributes to highlight.

  5. I do not have a preference for the size and dimensions of the heatmap.

  6. Sorting alphabetically might be useful, but I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference for the font style or size for the legend and labels.'
