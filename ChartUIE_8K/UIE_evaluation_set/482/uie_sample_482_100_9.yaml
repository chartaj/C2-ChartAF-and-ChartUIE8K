initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of seats
  (MdBs) among different political parties in the German Bundestag. Use the summary
  data to showcase how many seats each party holds. Each section of the donut should
  represent a different party, labeled with the party name and the number of seats
  they hold. Use vibrant colors for clarity and ensure that the chart accurately reflects
  the data given. This should help in understanding the composition of the German
  government at a glance. Thank you!
