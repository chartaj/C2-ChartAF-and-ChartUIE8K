initial_prompt: I want a column chart that shows the number of MdBs (members of the
  German Bundestag) for different political parties. The chart should clearly label
  each party and show their respective MdBs counts. Use the data to include parties
  like The Left, SPD, and The Greens. Ensure the chart is easy to read and highlights
  the differences between the number of MdBs for each party. Include legends, axes
  labels, and title relevant to German Bundestag and government composition. Make
  it visually appealing and informative, considering a non-expert audience.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for easier reading?

  3. How would you like the party names to be labeled on the x-axis (full names, abbreviations,
  or both)?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for the chart labels and title?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title''s wording?

  6. Would you like to display the exact MdB count values on top of each column?

  7. Should the chart include any specific annotations or callouts for certain data
  points?

  8. Are there any additional parties you would like to include beyond The Left, SPD,
  and The Greens?

  9. Do you want the columns to be displayed in any specific order (e.g., descending
  by count, alphabetical)?

  10. Is there any specific styling or design element you prefer for making the chart
  visually appealing and informative for a non-expert audience?'
