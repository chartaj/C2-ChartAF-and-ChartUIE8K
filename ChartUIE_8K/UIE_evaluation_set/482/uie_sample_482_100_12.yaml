initial_prompt: I have a dataset from the German Bundestag about political parties
  and their number of MdBs (members). I want to visualize the distribution of members
  across different parties using a lollipop chart. The dataset includes information
  like party abbreviations and the count of their representatives. Make sure the chart
  clearly shows each partyâ€™s name alongside the number of MdBs they have. Please use
  distinct colors to differentiate between parties and make the chart visually appealing
  and easy to understand. This will help in better understanding the representation
  of parties in the government. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party, or should
  we use a default color palette?

  2. How would you like the party names to be displayed: with abbreviations, full
  names, or both?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels and titles in the chart?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines to help viewers better interpret the data
  values?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the colors associated with each party?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you would like the lollipop
  chart to have?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a title or any specific annotations to highlight
  key insights?'

  3. I am not sure.
