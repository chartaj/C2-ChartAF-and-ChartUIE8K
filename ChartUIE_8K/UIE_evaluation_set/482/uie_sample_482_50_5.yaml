initial_prompt: Please create a column chart showing the number of MdBs (members of
  the German Bundestag) for different political parties. Use the data provided, including

  abbreviations?

  for it?

  4. Do you require any specific labels or annotations on the columns for clarity?

  5. Should the chart display the exact count of MdBs directly on top of each column?

  6. Would you like to include any reference lines, such as an average or a benchmark
  line?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the political parties (e.g., alphabetical,
  by number of MdBs, etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, or is it sufficient to rely on the axis labels
  for identifying the parties?

  9. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text in the chart?
