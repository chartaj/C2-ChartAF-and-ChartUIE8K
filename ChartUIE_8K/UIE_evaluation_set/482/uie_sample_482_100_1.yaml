initial_prompt: Create a visual representation of the German Bundestag's composition
  with a pie chart. Use the data to show the distribution of parliamentary seats (MdBs)
  among different political parties. Highlight "SPD" and "The Greens" to make them
  stand out, and include annotations for these parties to give more context, such

  makeup and identify key parties.

  "The Greens"?

  5. Would you like the party names to be displayed along with their abbreviations
  in the chart?

  for its placement?'
