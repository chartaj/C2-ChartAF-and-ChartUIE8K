initial_prompt: I'd like to create a bar chart visualizing the representation of different
  political parties in the German Bundestag. The chart should show each party's abbreviation
  (Abbr.) on the x-axis and the number of Members of the Bundestag (MdBs) on the y-axis.
  Please ensure the data is correctly represented, with each party distinctly color-coded.
  Also, include appropriate labels and a title for clarity. This will help to better
  understand the distribution of seats among the parties in the government. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party?

  2. Do you want the bars to be displayed in a particular order? For example, sorted
  by the number of Members of the Bundestag or alphabetically?

  3. Would you prefer the bars to be horizontal instead of vertical?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the font or style of the title and labels?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color-coding for each party, or
  is it sufficient to use labels directly on the bars?

  6. Is there a particular format you would like for the numbers on the y-axis (e.g.,
  plain numbers, comma-separated, etc.)?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?'
