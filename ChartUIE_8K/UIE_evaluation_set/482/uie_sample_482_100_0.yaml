initial_prompt: Create a pictogram showing the number of MdBs (members of the Bundestag)
  for each party using icons representing people. Highlight The Left, SPD, and The
  Greens, as shown in the sample data. Use text annotations to display the number
  of MdBs next to each party's icons. The goal is to visually convey the composition
  of the Bundestag and emphasize the three highlighted parties. The visualization
  should help viewers quickly understand the distribution and significance of each
  party's representation in the government. Include contextual annotations about the
  Bundestag's role.
