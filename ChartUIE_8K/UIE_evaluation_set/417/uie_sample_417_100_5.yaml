initial_prompt: I want to create a box chart that visualizes the relationship between
  the number of babies named "Mia" and UFO sightings from 1945 to 2010. Specifically,
  I want to see the distribution and any potential outliers in the data for both variables
  over those years. Please use the data from the file '417.csv'. Make sure the chart
  clearly indicates both the median values and the range of the data for each variable.
  This is for an astrology-related project, so any notable patterns or correlations
  should be highlighted. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. How would you like any notable patterns or correlations to be highlighted?

  3. Would you prefer the chart to display grid lines for easier reading?

  4. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitles? If yes, do you have specific
  wording in mind?

  5. Do you want legend descriptions to be added to the chart?

  6. Should the axes labels be customized? If yes, what labels would you prefer for
  each axis?

  7. Do you have a preference for the style and size of the font used in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or labels directly on the chart to indicate
  key statistics such as medians and ranges?

  9. Should there be any special formatting for the outliers, such as distinct markers
  or colors?'
