initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the dataset on babies named "Mia"
  and UFO sightings from 1945-2010. Ensure the histogram includes annotations to highlight
  key data points like the year with the highest number of babies named "Mia" and
  any significant spikes in UFO sightings. Use different colors to distinguish between
  "Mia" names and UFO sightings data. The chart will help analyze trends over time,
  examining any correlation between the popularity of the name "Mia" and UFO sightings,
  possibly offering insights into cultural or social influences over the years.
