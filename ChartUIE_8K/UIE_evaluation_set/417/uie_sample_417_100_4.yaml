initial_prompt: Hi! I need a line chart that visualizes the data I have. The data
  includes the number of babies named "Mia" and UFO sightings over the years. The
  chart should have the years on the x-axis and the values for babies named "Mia"
  and UFO sightings on the y-axis. Please use different colored lines for each set
  of data (babies named "Mia" and UFO sightings). Make sure the chart is clear and
  easy to read, with labels for both axes and a legend. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing the
  two datasets?

  2. Would you like to customize the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for better
  differentiation?

  3. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for easier reading of values? If so, both
  horizontal and vertical or just one?

  4. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for specific data points?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  7. Should the y-axis have a fixed range, or should it adjust based on the data?

  8. Would you like to include axis titles and any specific wording for these titles?'
