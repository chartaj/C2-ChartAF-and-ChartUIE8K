initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the annual revenue of various
  media franchises, highlighting different revenue categories such as Book sales,
  Box Office, and Home Video/Entertainment. Annotate key franchises like "A Song of
  Ice and Fire / Game of Thrones" with their revenue amounts for each category to
  draw attention to major contributors. This will help emphasize trends in revenue
  generation across different years and media types. Use different colors or visual
  adjustments to distinguish between the revenue categories, making it easier to understand
  the distribution and significant outliers in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  revenue categories?

  2. Would you like a specific label or title for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Should the key franchises be annotated with specific icons or just with text?

  4. How would you like the significant outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, bolded)?

  5. Do you want a legend explaining the color-coding for revenue categories?

  6. Are there specific revenue thresholds you want highlighted or marked on the histogram?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style or font for the text annotations and labels?

  8. Should the revenue amounts be displayed in a specific format (e.g., millions,
  billions, etc.)?

  9. Do you want grid lines on the histogram for better readability? If yes, any preference
  on the grid style?

  10. Would you like to include any additional text or notes on the chart to explain
  the context or findings?'
