initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart to visualize the top-grossing movies, focusing
  on their Worldwide Sales over the years. Annotate key movies, such as "Avatar" and
  "Avengers: Endgame," to highlight their performance. Use highlights to differentiate
  genres and distributors. This chart will help users quickly understand trends in
  movie sales and the impact of budget and distributor on revenue.'

  distributors?

  other details?

  markers?

  4. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the annotations (e.g., font
  size, font color)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines and axis labels for better readability?

  6. Are there specific genres or distributors you want to highlight more prominently?

  7. Should the line chart include a legend to explain the color coding for genres
  and distributors?

  8. Do you prefer an emphasis on certain years or a particular time range to be highlighted?

  9. Would you like additional data like budget to be included as a tooltip or a secondary
  element in the chart?

  (e.g., background color, chart size)?'
