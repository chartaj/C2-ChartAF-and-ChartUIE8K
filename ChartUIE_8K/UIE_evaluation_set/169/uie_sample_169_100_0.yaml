initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different columns
  such as Age, Grade, Histological type, MSKCC type, Outcome, Sex, Site of primary
  STS, Status, and Treatment in the provided data. Highlight areas with strong correlations
  and annotate significant correlations to help understand relationships within the
  dataset. This visualization will serve as a useful tool for segmenting and analyzing
  soft tissue sarcomas, aiding in identifying important patterns and differences among
  various patient demographics and treatment outcomes. Ensure the heatmap is clear
  and easy to interpret for healthcare professionals and researchers.
questions: '1. What color scheme preferences do you have for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have specific threshold values for highlighting strong correlations?

  3. How would you like significant correlations to be annotated (e.g., with numerical
  values, asterisks)?

  4. Do you prefer the heatmap to display clusters or groups of related variables?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the variables to be arranged
  on the heatmap?

  6. Should missing or ''-''-coded data be handled in a specific way in the heatmap?

  7. What labeling conventions do you prefer for the axes and correlation values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. With numerical values.

  4. Yes, I prefer the heatmap to display clusters or groups of related variables.

  5. I do not have a specific order in which I would like the variables to be arranged.

  6. Handle missing or ''-''-coded data by excluding them from the correlation analysis.

  7. Use clear and concise labeling for the axes and correlation values to ensure
  the heatmap is easy to interpret.'
