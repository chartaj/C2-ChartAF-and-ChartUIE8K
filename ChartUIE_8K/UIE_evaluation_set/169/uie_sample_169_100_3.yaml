initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the progression and follow-up times
  for patients with soft tissue sarcomas. Specifically, I want to plot 'Time – diagnosis
  to MRI scan (days)', 'Time – diagnosis to last follow-up (days)', and 'Time – diagnosis
  to outcome (days)' against 'Age' for each patient. Use different colors or line
  styles to distinguish between these time intervals. This will help understand how
  these time metrics vary with age across different patients. Ensure labels and legends
  are clear. Thanks!
questions: '1. What line styles do you prefer for distinguishing between the different
  time intervals?

  2. Do you have any preferred colors for each time interval?

  3. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  4. Do you have any preference for the appearance of the axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for the labels and legends?

  6. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines?

  7. Is there a particular layout or positioning you prefer for the legend?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the gridlines on the chart?

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or notes to the chart?

  10. Do you want any custom labeling for the data points or axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No specific title, just something that indicates it''s about soft tissue sarcomas.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include data point markers on the lines.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No, no annotations or notes needed.

  10. No custom labeling required. Standard labels for the data points and axes are
  fine.'
