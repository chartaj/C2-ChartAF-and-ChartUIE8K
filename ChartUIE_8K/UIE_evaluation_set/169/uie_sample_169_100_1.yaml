initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to compare the Ages and Outcomes of patients segmented
  by their Histological type and Sex, highlighting those with 'High' Grade and 'Leiomyosarcoma'
  MSKCC type. Annotate data points showing the 'Status (NED, AWD, D)' for each demographic.
  Use color coding to differentiate between different treatment forms. This visualization
  will help understand the distribution and treatment outcomes for different patient
  groups in the study on Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Ensure to include 'Treatment' and 'Site
  of primary STS' as additional context.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?\n2. How would you\
  \ like to differentiate between different treatment forms using color coding? \n\
  3. Is there a specific way you would like the data points to be annotated for 'Status\
  \ (NED, AWD, D)'?\n4. Do you prefer any specific arrangement for segmenting by 'Histological\
  \ type' and 'Sex' on the X-axis?\n5. Should the 'Site of primary STS' be displayed\
  \ as labels, or do you have another preference?\n6. Would you like to display error\
  \ bars or confidence intervals for the data points?\n7. Do you have a preference\
  \ for the bar orientation (horizontal or vertical)?\n8. Are there any specific legends\
  \ or titles you would like to include in the chart?\n9. Should we use any specific\
  \ font style or size for the labels and annotations?"

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, maybe use different colors for each treatment type.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer them to be segmented by Sex first and then by Histological type.

  5. Display the ''Site of primary STS'' as labels.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Vertical orientation for the bars.

  8. Include a title like "Comparison of Ages and Outcomes for Soft Tissue Sarcoma
  Patients" and a legend explaining the colors for treatment forms.

  9. I have no specific preference.
