initial_prompt: Generate a choropleth map visualizing the global distribution of soft
  tissue sarcoma cases based on patient data. Use "Site of primary STS" and "Age"
  to show regional prevalence and age demographics, respectively, ensuring accurate
  and informative health insights.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for the choropleth map?\n\
  2. Would you prefer a specific age range categorization (e.g., under 18, 18-35,\
  \ 36-50, over 50) for age demographics?\n3. Do you want to include a legend or color\
  \ bar to indicate the values of soft tissue sarcoma cases?\n4. Should the map focus\
  \ on certain regions or countries, or cover the entire globe equally?\n5. Would\
  \ you like any additional contextual information or annotations on the map? \n6.\
  \ Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, Albers)?\n7.\
  \ What level of geographic detail do you prefer (e.g., country, state/province,\
  \ city)?\n8. Should the visualization highlight any specific data points or outliers?\n\
  9. Is there a particular style or format in which you want the data labels to appear\
  \ on the map?\n10. Would you like any interactive elements such as tooltip popups\
  \ on hover-over regions?"
