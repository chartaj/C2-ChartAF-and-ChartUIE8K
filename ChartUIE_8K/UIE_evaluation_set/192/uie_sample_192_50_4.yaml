initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Temperature (K),
  Luminosity(L/Lo), Radius(R/Ro), and Absolute magnitude(Mv) by Star type. Use different
  colors for each Star type.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  for different Star types?

  2. Would you like to include specific labels or annotations on the box chart?

  3. Do you prefer any particular ordering of the Star types along the categorical
  axis?

  4. Would you like to display any statistical information (e.g., median, quartiles)
  directly on the box plots?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors representing different
  Star types?

  7. Do you require any specific scaling for the y-axes for each of the attributes
  to be visualized?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for easier comparison?'
