initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between star temperature,
  luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude. This will help us understand how these
  properties relate to different star types, colors, and spectral classes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include labels for exact correlation values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific range for the color gradient in the heatmap?

  4. Would you like to include annotations on specific points of interest within the
  heatmap?

  5. Should the heatmap display any specific patterns or highlight specific correlations
  prominently?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to show hierarchical clustering or a simpler grid format?

  7. Would you like the heatmap to include legends explaining the correlation strength?

  8. Are there any specific outliers or data points you want to highlight in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the heatmap should include labels for exact correlation values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. A simpler grid format is preferred.

  7. Yes, please include legends explaining the correlation strength.
