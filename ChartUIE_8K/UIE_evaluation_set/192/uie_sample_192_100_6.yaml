initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to stars and their properties that aims to
  predict star types. Could you create a pie chart showing the distribution of different
  star types? The dataset columns include Temperature, Luminosity, Radius, Absolute
  magnitude, Star type, Star color, and Spectral Class. Ensure the pie chart is color-coded
  and provides both the percentage and count of each star type for easy interpretation.
  This visualization will help in understanding the composition of star types in this
  dataset better. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different star types?

  2. Would you prefer the pie chart to have a specific title?

  3. Are there any particular legend placements you prefer (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the pie chart include labels directly on the slices or just in the legend?

  6. Would you like the chart to display the star type categories in a specific order?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or descriptive text you want to include
  in the chart?

  8. Do you prefer the percentage and count information to be displayed on the same
  line or on separate lines?

  9. Would you like to show or hide gridlines on the pie chart?

  10. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?'
