initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the various
  star characteristics like Temperature (K), Luminosity(L/Lo), Radius(R/Ro), Absolute
  magnitude(Mv), Star type, Star color, and Spectral Class. This will help in understanding
  the relationship between these attributes and predicting star types. Use a gradient
  color scheme for clarity, and make sure the axis labels are clear and legible. If
  possible, include a color bar to indicate the strength of correlations. Visualize
  in a way that different star types can be easily distinguished.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to highlight any specific correlations or ranges within the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style or design for the axis labels?

  4. Are there any specific fonts you would like for the labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines within the heatmap?

  6. Is there a maximum or minimum value range you want to set for the color bar?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order in which attributes are displayed on the
  axes?

  8. Would you like to include annotations for specific data points within the heatmap?

  9. Should the different star types be represented by specific colors or markers?

  10. Are there any additional details or contextual information you would like to
  include in the visualization?'
