initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart for the NIFTY-50 stocks dataset.
  The x-axis should represent the stock symbols, and the y-axis should show the corresponding
  values. Group the bars by 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'LTP', 'Volume (lacs)', and 'Turnover
  (crs.)'. This will allow us to compare these key metrics for each stock side by
  side. Include all stocks listed in the sample data. Use different colors for each
  group to visually distinguish between them. Also, ensure the y-axis is properly
  labeled to reflect the units of measurement for each category.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each group (''Open'',
  ''High'', ''Low'', ''LTP'', ''Volume (lacs)'', ''Turnover (crs.)'')?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations for individual bars
  or groups?

  3. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to identify each group, and do you have a preferred
  position for it (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like to maintain for the stock symbols on
  the x-axis (alphabetical, by value, etc.)?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the grid lines (e.g., dashed, solid) or any
  particular background color for the chart?'
