initial_prompt: 'I want a bar chart visualizing the NIFTY-50 stocks dataset. Please
  display the "Symbol" on the x-axis and the "% Chng" on the y-axis. Highlight the
  3 sample symbols: ''ADANIPORTS'', ''ASIANPAINT'', and ''AXISBANK''. Use different
  colors for each bar. Annotate each bar with the exact "% Chng" value. Ensure the
  chart clearly shows both positive and negative percentage changes for each stock.
  Add a chart title, axis labels, and a legend explaining the colors. The x-axis should
  have a slight tilt for the symbols to prevent overlap. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different stocks?

  2. How would you like the highlighted symbols ''ADANIPORTS'', ''ASIANPAINT'', and
  ''AXISBANK'' to be differentiated? (e.g., specific colors, patterns, or boldness)

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations on the
  bars?

  4. Do you want the percentage change values to be displayed inside or above the
  bars?

  5. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  6. Would you like the axis labels to include any additional information beyond "Symbol"
  and "% Chng"?

  7. Is there a specific angle you prefer for tilting the x-axis labels to prevent
  overlap?

  8. Are there any preferred styles for the legend explaining the colors? (e.g., position,
  font, size)

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or design of the chart? (e.g.,
  background color, gridlines)'
