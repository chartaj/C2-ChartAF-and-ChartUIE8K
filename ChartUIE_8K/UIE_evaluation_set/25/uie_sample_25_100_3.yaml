initial_prompt: Create a pie chart that represents the market turnover (in crores)
  for NIFTY-50 stocks dataset. The chart should visualize each stock's contribution
  to the total turnover. The dataset includes symbols like ADANIPORTS, ASIANPAINT,
  AXISBANK, etc., with corresponding turnover values provided. Use this data to quantify
  and plot each stock's market turnover proportion. Make sure each section of the
  pie chart is labeled with the stock symbol and its percentage contribution to the
  total market turnover. This will help visualize the distribution of market activity
  among the top 50 NIFTY stocks.
