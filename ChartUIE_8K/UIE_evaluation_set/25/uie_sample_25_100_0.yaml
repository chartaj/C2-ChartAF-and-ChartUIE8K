initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the NIFTY-50 stocks data over a given
  period. Highlight key stocks such as ADANIPORTS, ASIANPAINT, and AXISBANK with annotations
  showing their LTP, % Chng, and 52w H/L values. Emphasize volume and turnover for
  these stocks in particular to show trading activity. Ensure trends over 30 days
  and one year are visible to connect short-term and long-term performance. Highlight
  significant changes with color-coded lines to distinguish between gains and losses.
  Keep the chart clean and professional, suitable for business analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  differentiating between gains and losses?

  colors or markers?

  3. Is there a specific way you would like the annotations to be displayed (e.g.,
  tooltip, data labels)?

  4. Would you prefer the volume and turnover to be shown as separate lines, or integrated
  into the main line chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the line styles (e.g., dashed lines for losses
  and solid lines for gains)?

  6. How would you prefer the axes to be scaled (e.g., logarithmic for volume and
  turnover)?

  7. Should significant changes be marked with specific symbols (e.g., arrows) in
  addition to color coding?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you would like to use for annotations
  and labels to ensure readability?

  9. Would you like a legend to be included? If so, are there specific details you
  want in the legend?

  10. Are there any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?'
