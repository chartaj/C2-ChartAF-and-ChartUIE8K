initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map using the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset
  to visualize the current weather conditions in different major cities. The map should
  use color gradients to represent "Temperature (°C)" and include hover-over info
  for "Humidity (%)", "Wind Speed (kph)", and "Weather Condition". This visualization
  will help compare and analyze weather conditions across various global locations
  at a single glance. Additionally, consider including markers showing "Pressure (mb)"
  and "UV Index" levels to provide more detailed insights into the atmospheric conditions
  of each city. Render dynamic changes if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or gradient for representing "Temperature
  (°C)"?

  2. Would you like the markers for "Pressure (mb)" and "UV Index" to be distinct
  shapes or colors?

  3. Should the map include a legend explaining the color gradient for temperature
  and the symbols for markers?

  4. Do you want the hover-over information to display all additional weather attributes
  simultaneously or in a specific order?

  5. Is there a specific map style or geographic projection you prefer for the Choropleth
  map?

  6. Would you like to include any additional geographical features or labels on the
  map (e.g., country borders, city names)?

  7. Do you prefer the data labels to be shown directly on the map or only upon hovering
  over the markers?

  8. Is there a particular level of zoom or focus area you would like the map to start
  with?

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or callouts for particular cities or weather
  events?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer distinct shapes for pressure and UV index markers.

  3. Yes, the map should include a legend.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Including country borders and city names would be helpful.

  7. I prefer data labels to be shown upon hovering over the markers.
