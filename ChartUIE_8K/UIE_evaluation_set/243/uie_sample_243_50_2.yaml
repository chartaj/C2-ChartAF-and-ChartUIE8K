initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing weather data for different locations
  on April 5, 2024. Use text annotations to highlight temperature and wind speed,
  while color highlights can emphasize weather conditions. This helps in understanding
  weather comparisons across locations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different weather conditions
  in the treemap?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations highlighting
  temperature and wind speed?

  3. Should the treemap be divided by geographical regions or just by individual locations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the treemap tiles based on a particular
  weather attribute (e.g., temperature, wind speed)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding for different
  weather conditions?

  6. Do you prefer a specific background color or theme for the treemap?

  7. Is there any specific ordering you would like for the locations (e.g., alphabetical,
  by temperature, etc.)?

  8. Should the text annotations be displayed inside the tiles, or would you prefer
  them to be placed outside with lines connecting to the tiles?'
