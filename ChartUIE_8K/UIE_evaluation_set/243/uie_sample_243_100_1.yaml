initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the 'Temperature (°C)' vs 'Humidity
  (%)' for the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset. Include text annotations to highlight
  the 'Temperature (°C)' and 'Humidity (%)' at each 'Observation Time'. Use highlights
  to emphasize data points that represent extreme weather conditions, such as the
  highest temperature and the lowest humidity. The purpose of this visualization is
  to analyze and understand the correlation between temperature and humidity across
  different locations and times in urban settings, helping to identify patterns and
  anomalies in weather conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the scatter plot
  points and highlights?

  2. Would you prefer the text annotations to be inside the plot area or outside the
  plot area, connected with lines?

  3. Are there any specific symbols or markers you would like to use for the data
  points, especially for the extremes?

  4. What size would you like the text annotations to be? (e.g., small, medium, large)

  5. Should the annotations for extreme weather conditions be styled differently (e.g.,
  bold, different color)?

  6. Would you like a legend to explain the highlights and annotations?

  7. Do you have a preference for the title and axis labels format or font style?
