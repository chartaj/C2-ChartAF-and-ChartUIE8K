initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the weather conditions from
  the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset, particularly highlighting the distribution
  of different weather conditions recorded. Each segment of the pie chart should represent
  the proportion of unique weather conditions like 'Partly cloudy', 'Sunny', 'Rainy',
  etc. Additionally, include the percentage share of each weather condition in the
  chart. Make sure it is clear and easy to understand, with legends and labels properly
  formatted for a quick overview of prevailing weather patterns.
