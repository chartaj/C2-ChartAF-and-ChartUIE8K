initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing temperature, humidity, and wind
  speed for each location. Arrange the bars side by side for easy comparison. Use
  different colors for temperature, humidity, and wind speed bars. Label the x-axis
  with locations and the y-axis with the respective values. This chart should help
  me understand how weather conditions differ across various locales. Make sure the
  chart is easy to read and visually appealing. Thank you!
