initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the weather data from the
  Global Metropolis Weather Dataset. Each group should represent a different location,
  with bars for each weather attribute like Temperature (째C), Feels Like (째C), Humidity
  (%), Wind Speed (kph), Cloud Cover (%), Pressure (mb), UV Index, and Visibility
  (km). Make sure each bar's color represents a unique weather attribute for clear
  distinction and comparison between locations. Include a legend for the weather attributes
  and label the x-axis with different locations and the y-axis with the corresponding
  values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each weather attribute?

  2. Do you want the bars to be displayed in a particular order within each group?

  3. Would you like to display data labels on each bar to show exact values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the format or style of the legend?

  5. Is there a specific range or scaling you prefer for the y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preferred font type or size for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison across different locations
  and attributes?

  8. Are there any specific visual elements (like background color or border styles)
  you would like included in the chart?

  9. How many locations do you plan to include in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please display data labels on each bar.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for easier comparison.

  8. I do not have any specific visual elements in mind.

  9. Around 4-5 locations.'
