initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the weather conditions in
  different locations. Use text annotations for temperature and humidity data points.
  Highlights can emphasize areas with extreme weather conditions, high wind speeds,
  or high UV index values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the highlights to be in a specific color to emphasize extreme
  conditions?

  3. What style of text annotations do you prefer for temperature and humidity data
  points (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  4. Should the geographic boundaries be displayed (e.g., country, state, city boundaries)?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the heatmap colors and highlighted
  values?

  6. How would you like extreme weather conditions to be indicated (e.g., icons, symbols,
  or specific colors)?

  7. Would you prefer any specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers equal-area)?

  8. Is there a particular base map style you want (e.g., street map, satellite imagery)?

  9. Do you want to classify UV Index and Wind Speed into specific ranges for visualization?

  10. Are there particular locations or regions you want to focus on or include in
  the heatmap?

  11. Should the visualization include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they
  be?'
