initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the population growth of the
  top three most populous countries (India, China, United States) from 1970 to 2023.
  Each bar should represent a specific year, and the segments of each bar should represent
  the population of each country stacked on top of each other. Color code the segments
  for each country distinctly. Include a legend for country identification and a title
  indicating what the chart represents. The x-axis should represent the years, and
  the y-axis should represent the population in billions. Make sure the bars are placed
  chronologically and clearly labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each country in the
  chart?

  2. Would you like the population numbers displayed on each segment of the bars?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  4. Do you want gridlines in the chart for better readability of the values?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a particular position (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences around the chart area?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  8. Is there a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  rotated)?
