initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the population density of countries
  across different continents from 1970 to 2023. Highlight significant changes and
  growth rates.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. How would you like to indicate significant changes and growth rates on the heatmap?
  (e.g., special markers, annotations)

  3. Should the heatmap include a legend that explains the color intensity levels?

  4. Would you prefer the heatmap to be sorted by continent or country?

  5. Should population density be displayed on a per-decade basis, or would you prefer
  yearly intervals?

  6. Is there a specific range or scale for the population density that you want to
  emphasize or cap at?

  7. Do you want to include a title and/or subtitles for the heatmap? If so, please
  provide the text.

  8. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to add to highlight important
  data points or trends?

  9. Would you prefer the heatmap to include grid lines to separate the data intervals
  clearly?

  10. Should the heatmap display numerical values of population density directly on
  the cells, or should it rely purely on color intensity?

  11. Are there any specific countries or continents you want to focus on or emphasize
  more prominently in the heatmap?

  12. How would you like to handle missing data or gaps in the dataset?

  13. Are there any supplementary data or additional context you would like to include
  in the heatmap?'
