initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the percentage of the world
  population in 2023 by continent using the "World data population" dataset. Each
  segment should represent a continent and its share of the world population. Include
  labels for each continent and percentage values. Use the 2023 population data for
  calculation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the donut chart?

  2. Should the percentage labels be displayed inside the segments or outside?

  3. Do you want the chart to include a title and subtitle? If yes, please provide

  5. Should a legend be included? If so, where should it be placed (top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the thickness of the donut chart segments?

  7. Should each continent’s segment be emphasized in any way (e.g., with a border
  or shadow)?

  8. Would you like to include data source attribution on the chart? If so, please
  provide the text.

  9. Is there any specific arrangement order for the continents’ segments (e.g., descending
  order by population, alphabetical)?

  10. Do you have a preference for any additional information to be included, such
  as tooltips for more details on hover?'
