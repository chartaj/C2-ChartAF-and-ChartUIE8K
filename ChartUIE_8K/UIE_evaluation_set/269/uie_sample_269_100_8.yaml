initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the population growth of countries
  from 1970 to 2023 using the provided dataset. Display the population distribution
  for key years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2022, 2023) on the x-axis
  and frequency on the y-axis. Use different colors to represent each year. Make sure
  to highlight the top populous countries like India, China, and the United States.
  Include appropriate labels for clarity. The chart should help in understanding population
  trends over decades across different continents.
