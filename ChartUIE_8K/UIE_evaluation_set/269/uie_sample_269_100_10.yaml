initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the 2023 population distribution by
  continent using the provided dataset. Display the total population partitioned into
  respective continents (Asia, North America, etc.), enabling easy comparison of how
  the global population is spread across different regions. Use distinct colors for
  each continent and include clear labels or a legend to identify each segment. This
  will help in understanding population density and allocation across the continents.
  Make sure the chart is clean, easy to read, and accurately reflects the data provided.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to include percentage labels on each segment of the pie chart?

  3. Is there any specific order in which the continents should be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by population size)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the chart include a title or any additional text descriptions?

  6. Would you like to display the actual population numbers along with the percentages
  in the chart labels?

  7. Do you prefer the legend to be positioned at a specific location (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right) on the chart?'
