initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart visualizing the population growth of the top
  three most populous countries: India, China, and the United States. Use the data
  from 1970 to 2023. Include text annotations for each country''s population data
  point in the years 1970, 2000, and 2023. The chart should highlight these years
  with different colors or markers to emphasize the growth trends distinctly. This
  visualization is to understand the population growth trends in these countries within
  the context of global population dynamics. Label the x-axis with the years and the
  y-axis with the population count.'

  more prominently apart from the years 1970, 2000, and 2023?'
