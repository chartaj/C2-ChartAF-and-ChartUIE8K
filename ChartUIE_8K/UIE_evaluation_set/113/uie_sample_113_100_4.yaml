initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that shows the total alcohol consumption per capita
  (liters of pure alcohol) for different countries over multiple years. The x-axis
  should represent the countries, and the y-axis should show the total alcohol consumption
  per capita. Use different bars to depict the data for each year within the same
  country. This will help visualize trends in alcohol consumption over time across
  different regions. Ensure the chart is clear, with labels for countries, years,
  and consumption values. Use distinct colors for different years to differentiate
  them easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme to represent
  different years?

  2. Do you prefer the countries to be sorted in a particular order on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetically or by consumption values)?

  3. Would you like value labels to be displayed on top of each bar?

  4. How many years of data would you like to display at most?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font type and size for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability of the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title or legends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference; either alphabetically or by consumption
  values works.

  3. Yes, I would like value labels to be displayed on top of each bar.

  4. I would like to display data for at most 5 years.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  7. I do not have any specific requirements for the chart title or legends.'
