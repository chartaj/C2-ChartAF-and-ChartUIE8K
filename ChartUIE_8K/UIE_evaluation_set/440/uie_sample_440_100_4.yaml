initial_prompt: I want to see a histogram showing the frequency of different speakers
  in the "Friends" TV show dataset. Please use the "speaker" column to create the
  histogram and consider only those with significant lines of dialogue. The x-axis
  should represent the unique speakers, and the y-axis should represent the count
  of their spoken lines. This will help in analyzing which character has the most
  dialogues. Please ensure labels and a legend are included for clarity. Additionally,
  it would be great if you can highlight the top three characters by dialogue count.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the histogram,
  especially for highlighting the top three characters?

  2. What font size and style do you prefer for the labels on the axes?

  3. Would you like to include any specific title for the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the format of the legend?

  5. Do you prefer the bars to be horizontal or vertical?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific order you want the bars to be displayed in (e.g., alphabetical,
  by dialogue count)?

  8. Do you want to set a minimum threshold for the number of lines a speaker must
  have to be included in the histogram?

  9. Are there any other characters or data points you specifically want to emphasize
  besides the top three?'
