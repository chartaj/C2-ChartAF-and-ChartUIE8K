initial_prompt: Create a pie chart that illustrates the distribution of unique speakers
  in the dataset. Annotate the chart to highlight the top three speakers with the
  most distinct lines. Use text annotations to show their names and number of lines.
  Highlights should visually emphasize these top speakers by using distinct colors
  or sizes. This visualization helps understand which characters are most prominent
  in the "Friends" TV show data, providing insights into character dominance in dialogue.
  Ensure the chart context aligns with "media-and-communications" and the focus is
  on character distribution.
