initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the number of unique speakers in each
  season of "Friends." Highlight the season with the highest number of unique speakers.
  Annotate the bars with the exact count of unique speakers for better clarity. Use
  this chart to analyze how character diversity changes across seasons, which can
  provide insights into character dynamics and screen time distribution. The data
  covers various seasons and includes metadata such as episodes and scenes, which
  might be useful for deeper analysis in future visualizations.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the season with the highest number of unique speakers to be
  highlighted (e.g., different color, bold outline)?

  3. Where would you like the annotations for the exact count of unique speakers to
  be placed (e.g., inside the bars, above the bars)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations and axis labels?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  preferences for them?

  6. Do you want a legend included in the chart?

  7. Are there any additional metadata (e.g., episodes, scenes) that you would like
  to be visually represented or annotated in this chart?

  8. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted in ascending or descending order based
  on the number of unique speakers?

  9. Do you have a preferred format for displaying numeric values (e.g., integers,
  with commas)?'
