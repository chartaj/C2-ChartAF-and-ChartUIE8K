initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the frequency of unique speakers across
  different scenes and episodes in the TV show "Friends" based on the given dataset.
  The heatmap should have scenes on the y-axis and episodes on the x-axis, with each
  cell color representing the count of dialogues by each speaker. Use a color gradient
  to easily distinguish between low and high frequencies. Ensure that missing speaker
  values are accounted for appropriately. This will help identify patterns in character
  appearances and dialogue distribution throughout the seasons.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing low to high
  frequencies in the heatmap?

  2. Is there a specific color you would like to use for cells with missing speaker
  values?

  3. Would you prefer to display any labels or annotations on the cells to indicate
  the frequency counts?

  4. Do you want to include any specific legends or keys to explain the color gradient
  on the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and titles?

  6. Would you like to highlight certain scenes, episodes, or speakers specifically
  within the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color gradient.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please display labels or annotations on the cells to indicate the frequency
  counts.

  4. Yes, please include a legend or key to explain the color gradient.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No, I do not have any specific scenes, episodes, or speakers to highlight.'
