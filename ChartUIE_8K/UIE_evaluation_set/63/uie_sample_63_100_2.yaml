initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'AnnualIncome'
  across different 'Age' groups. Use text annotations to highlight the mean and median
  values within each age group to focus the viewer's attention on central tendencies.
  Highlight bars corresponding to different 'ProductCategory' to differentiate categories.
  The data represents customer demographics and behaviors, so the histogram will help
  in understanding purchasing power and its variation with age, thus aiding in predicting
  customer purchasing behavior. Additionally, incorporate editorial comments to provide
  context about the purpose of the analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the ''ProductCategory''
  bars?

  2. Would you like the age groups to be presented in specific intervals or automatically
  determined intervals?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text annotations of mean
  and median values?

  4. How detailed should the editorial comments be? Do you want them placed inside
  the chart or as a caption below?

  5. Should the histogram include a legend to explain the different ''ProductCategory''
  colors?

  6. Are there any particular chart titles or labels you would like to use for the
  axes and chart itself?

  7. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., horizontal
  vs. vertical bars)?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the histogram to aid in
  readability?

  9. Do you have a preference for the type or style of annotations used to highlight
  key statistics?'
