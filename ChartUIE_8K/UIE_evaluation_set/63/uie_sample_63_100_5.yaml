initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the distribution of annual income
  across different product categories in our customer purchase behavior dataset. The
  x-axis should represent the product categories, and the y-axis should show the annual
  income. Additionally, I want to differentiate the box plots by loyalty program status
  and see how income distribution varies for loyal and non-loyal customers. This will
  help in understanding if loyalty program members have different income levels across
  product categories.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the box plots to differentiate
  between loyal and non-loyal customers?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should we include any specific gridlines or background colors for better visibility?

  5. Do you prefer the box plots to be displayed in a vertical or horizontal orientation?

  6. Would you like to include any additional statistical information, such as mean
  or median lines, within the box plots?

  7. Are there any specific legends or annotations you would like to include to clarify
  the data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Product Categories" and the y-axis should
  be labeled "Annual Income".

  3. I have no specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I prefer the box plots to be displayed in a vertical orientation.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between loyal and non-loyal customers.'
