initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the relationship between 'ProductCategory'
  and 'NumberOfPurchases' segmented by 'Gender.' Annotations should highlight key
  data points such as the highest and lowest 'NumberOfPurchases' for each product
  category and gender. Use different colors to distinguish between male and female.
  The chart aims to uncover purchase behavior trends across different product categories
  and genders, which can inform marketing strategies. For better context, include
  non-data-driven annotations explaining any significant patterns or outliers observed
  within the data. This will help in understanding customer purchasing habits effectively.
