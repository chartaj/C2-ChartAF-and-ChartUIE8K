initial_prompt: Please create a beeswarm chart to visualize the distribution of all
  the key features in the cancer classification dataset, highlighting 'benign_0__mal_1'
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting ''benign''
  and ''malignant'' cases?

  2. Would you prefer a particular ordering of the features on the chart, or should
  they be displayed in their default order?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the shape or size of the data points (e.g., circles,
  squares, etc.)?

  4. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to use for the chart?

  5. Are there any particular axes labels or legends you want to include or customize?

  6. Do you want any additional statistical summaries or annotations (such as mean
  lines or quartiles) shown on the chart?

  7. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the chart?'
