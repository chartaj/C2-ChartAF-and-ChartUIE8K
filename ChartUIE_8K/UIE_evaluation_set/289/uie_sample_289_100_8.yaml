initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot to visualize the mean radius data from the
  provided cancer classification dataset. I want to see each mean radius value on
  the x-axis and their corresponding counts on the y-axis so I can quickly identify
  the distribution of mean radius values across the benign and malignant cases. Use
  different colors to distinguish between benign (0) and malignant (1) cases. This
  will help me understand the spread and frequency of radius sizes in this health
  dataset. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred colors for distinguishing benign and malignant\
  \ cases on the dot plot?\n2. What size and style of dots do you prefer for the plot?\
  \ \n3. Do you have any specific preferences for the x-axis and y-axis labels or\
  \ titles?\n4. Would you like grid lines on the plot to help with reading the values?\n\
  5. Is there a specific chart title you would prefer?\n6. Do you have any preferences\
  \ regarding the font style and size for the labels and title?\n7. Would you like\
  \ to display a legend to indicate which color corresponds to benign and malignant\
  \ cases?\n8. Do you have a preference for the overall size and aspect ratio of the\
  \ plot?\n9. Would you like to include any specific annotations or reference lines\
  \ on the plot?\n10. Are there any specific ranges or scales you would like to set\
  \ for the x-axis and y-axis?"
