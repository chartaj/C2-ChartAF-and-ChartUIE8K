initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the mean radius versus mean texture
  with data-driven text annotations highlighting outlier points. Additionally, use
  highlights to distinguish malignant (1) from benign (0) cases for cancer classification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between malignant
  and benign cases?

  2. Do you have a specific style or format for the text annotations on the outlier
  points?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preferred shape or symbol for the data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  5. What size would you prefer for the data points on the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend?

  7. Would you like axis titles and labels to be formatted in a specific way?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and annotations?

  9. Would you like to include a title for the scatter plot? If yes, what should it
  be?'
