initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation among various
  measured features in the cancer classification dataset. Include all features such
  as mean radius, mean texture, and the rest, focusing on their relationships. Highlight
  strong positive and negative correlations with distinct colors. The data should
  reflect health data accurately and clearly indicate patterns or trends that could
  assist in understanding features contributing to cancer classification. Ensure the
  heatmap is labeled properly for easier comprehension. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to set a particular threshold for highlighting strong positive
  and negative correlations?

  3. Do you prefer any specific scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for the heatmap?

  4. Would you like to include or exclude any specific features from the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences on how the axis labels should be formatted or displayed?'
answers: "1. I am not sure about the color palette. \n2. Yes, please highlight correlations\
  \ above 0.7 for strong positive and below -0.7 for strong negative correlations.\n\
  3. I do not have a specific preference for the scale.\n4. I am not sure, please\
  \ include all features for a comprehensive overview.\n5. No specific preference,\
  \ just ensure the axis labels are clear and readable."
