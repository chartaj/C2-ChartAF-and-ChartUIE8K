initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the comparison between benign
  and malignant tumor samples. Use the mean values for radius, texture, perimeter,
  area, and smoothness for the first three samples in both benign and malignant categories.
  Highlight differences to quickly identify significant variations between the two
  groups. This will help in easily spotting potential indicators of tumor types based
  on given metrics. Make the chart visually appealing and clear.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars representing benign
  and malignant tumor samples?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the bars to highlight
  key differences?

  3. How would you prefer to display the y-axis scale, linear or logarithmic?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference for the chart labels and titles?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart? If yes,
  should they be in the foreground or the background?

  6. Should the chart include error bars to indicate the variability in mean values?

  7. Do you have a preference for the bar width and spacing between groups on the
  chart?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to have a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  9. Is there any specific style or formatting you would like for the chart title
  and axis labels?

  10. Should the chart background have a particular color or gradient?'
