initial_prompt: I need a bar chart showing the top 10 most streamed Spotify songs
  of 2023. The x-axis should represent the track names, and the y-axis should show
  the number of streams. Please color-code the bars based on the artist's name to
  differentiate between them. Additionally, include labels for the release month and
  day on the bars. This will help in quickly identifying the release timing of the
  top songs. Use the provided data format for accuracy. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the order of the bars (e.g., descending
  order of streams)?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating the artists?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for easier comparison of streams?

  4. Should the track names on the x-axis be horizontally or vertically oriented?

  5. Do you want the data labels (release month and day) on top of the bars or inside
  the bars?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the chart labels and
  titles?'
answers: '1. Yes, please order the bars in descending order of streams.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Horizontally oriented would be preferable.

  5. On top of the bars would be great.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for fonts or styles.'
