initial_prompt: I want a histogram visualizing the distribution of streaming counts
  for the most streamed Spotify songs in 2023. Make sure to use the "streams" column
  from the data provided. Additionally, color-code the bars by "released_month" to
  see if there's any trend in streaming counts based on the month the song was released.
  Ensure each bar represents a range of streaming counts, and the x-axis should show
  these count ranges. The y-axis should reflect the frequency of songs within those
  ranges. Please label both axes clearly and include a legend for the colors used.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the bars representing
  different months?

  2. What is your preferred bin size or range for the streaming counts on the x-axis?

  3. Would you like the y-axis to be in linear or logarithmic scale?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be both on x- and y-axes?

  7. Would you like to include any additional titles or annotations on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Linear scale.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, gridlines on both x- and y-axes.

  7. I do not know.'
