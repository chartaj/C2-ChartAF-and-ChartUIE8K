initial_prompt: 'I''d like a histogram for the Colonia Corpus of Historical Portuguese
  to visualize the distribution of Tokens by Year. Highlight the years with the highest
  and lowest token counts to show outliers. Annotate specific bars representing unique
  works such as "Feitos de Mem de Sá," "Auto de Sao Lourenco," and "Gramática" to
  draw attention to their contributions. Purpose: to understand the textual volume
  across different years within the corpus, emphasizing key works and periods. This
  will help in analyzing trends and the prominence of certain authors and their works
  over time.'
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting the bars with\
  \ the highest and lowest token counts?\n2. Would you like the annotated bars to\
  \ have different colors or styles to distinguish them from the rest?\n3. How would\
  \ you prefer the annotations for specific works to be displayed? (e.g., above the\
  \ bar, inside the bar, tooltip on hover)\n4. Do you have a specific range of years\
  \ you want to focus on or display in the histogram?\n5. Would you like to include\
  \ gridlines or a reference line to indicate average token counts or other statistical\
  \ measures?\n6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and\
  \ annotations? \n7. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels have any specific formatting\
  \ preferences?\n8. Are there any specific data points or years you wish to exclude\
  \ from the histogram?\n9. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the histogram\
  \ bars (vertical or horizontal)? \n10. Would you like to add a legend to the chart\
  \ to explain the annotations and highlighted bars?"
