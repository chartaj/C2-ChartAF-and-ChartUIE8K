initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the total number of tokens for each
  author from the Colonia Corpus of Historical Portuguese. Highlight the authors with
  the highest and lowest token counts. Annotate these bars with their exact token
  values. The purpose of the chart is to compare token counts across different authors
  and identify those with notably high or low contributions. Additionally, provide
  annotations with unique values for better analysis. Ensure the 16th-century subcorpus
  is clearly indicated. The chartâ€™s visual emphasis should aid in understanding historical
  linguistic contributions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the 16th-century subcorpus to be indicated (e.g., specific
  color, pattern)?

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for this chart?

  4. Are there any specific fonts you would like to use for annotations and labels?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be shown on the chart?

  6. Should there be a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should they be?

  7. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend?

  8. How detailed would you like the axis labels to be?

  9. Would you like any specific sorting order for the authors (e.g., by token count,
  alphabetically)?

  10. Should the bars have a specific width or spacing?'
