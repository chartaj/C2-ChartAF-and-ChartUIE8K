initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap showing the distribution of texts
  by their authors from the 16th century Portuguese corpus. Use the "Tokens" data
  to indicate volume, highlighting authors with notably high token counts. Annotate
  key authors like José de Anchieta and João de Barros, focusing on their contributions
  and impact areas. Include visual elements to distinguish the time periods captured.
  The intent is to analyze the geographical spread and concentration of literary works
  to understand cultural and linguistic development.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale and token counts?

  3. How would you prefer key authors like José de Anchieta and João de Barros to
  be annotated (e.g., specific markers, labels)?

  4. Would you like the time periods to be represented by distinct colors or another
  visual element?

  5. Are there specific geographic regions or areas that you want to highlight or
  focus on?

  6. Should the map include place names or geographic markers for better context?

  7. Would you prefer the token volume to be represented by varying color intensity
  or another method (e.g., size of markers)?

  8. Do you have particular font preferences or styles for the text annotations on
  the map?'
