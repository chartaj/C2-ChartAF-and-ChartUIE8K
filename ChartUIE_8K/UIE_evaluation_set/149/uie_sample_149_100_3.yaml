initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of unique
  values in the 'Author' and 'Title' columns from the dataset provided. Highlight
  the proportion of unique authors and titles distinctly within the 16th Century subcorpus.
  Ensure that each segment of the donut chart is labeled with the corresponding author
  and title for better clarity. The chart should help in understanding the spread
  of work among different authors and their significant works during this century,
  contributing to historical Portuguese literature studies. Use contrasting colors
  to differentiate segments clearly.

  chart?
