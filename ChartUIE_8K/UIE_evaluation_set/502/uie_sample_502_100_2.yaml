initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap based on the data provided. Use the 'summary'
  and 'sample_data' columns to visualize the distribution and intensity of values
  at various locations, corresponding to each data point in the dataset. The heatmap
  should help identify hotspots and patterns effectively. Utilize text annotations
  for key data points to draw attention to significant values, while highlighting
  specific areas with distinctive colors to emphasize their importance. This visualization
  will aid in understanding the geographical spread and intensity of the data for
  insightful analysis and decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific geographical regions you want to focus on or emphasize?

  3. How would you like the intensity of the values to be represented (e.g., gradient,
  specific color ranges)?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for the text annotations (e.g., city
  level, state level)?

  5. Are there any particular data points or regions you want highlighted with distinctive
  colors?

  6. Do you have preferences for the style and size of the text annotations?

  7. Should the heatmap include any additional features like a legend or a title?

  8. Are there any specific hotspots or patterns you anticipate and want to ensure
  are visible?

  9. Would you like to include any additional geographic layers (e.g., political boundaries,
  main roads)?'
