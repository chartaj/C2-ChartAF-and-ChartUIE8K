initial_prompt: Create a box plot for columns '0' to '23' to visualize the distribution,
  median, and outliers for each of these variables. This will help identify the variability
  and central tendency of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box plots?

  2. Should the box plots include notches to indicate the confidence interval around
  the median?

  3. Do you want to display the actual data points overlaid on the box plots?

  4. Should we include the mean value as a marker within each box plot?

  5. Do you have a specific order in which the columns should be displayed in the
  box plots?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like for the axes and the overall
  plot?

  7. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the box plots, such as horizontal or
  vertical?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines in the background of the plot for better
  readability?

  9. Are there any specific outliers handling or visualization preferences you have
  in mind?

  10. Should the width of the boxes be adjusted to reflect the sample size of each
  variable?'
