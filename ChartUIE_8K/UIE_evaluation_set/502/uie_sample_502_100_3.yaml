initial_prompt: I need a Treemap visualizing the distribution of values across the
  different columns in the data file 502.csv. Each column from '0' to '23' should
  represent a category in the treemap, and their values should determine the size
  of the blocks within each category. I want to see how these values compare with
  each other in a hierarchical and space-efficient manner. The chart should highlight
  how each value contributes to the total across all columns. Please give me the chart
  in a way that helps me understand the overall distribution and identify any significant
  patterns or outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or themes for the treemap?

  2. Would you like the values within each category to be labeled on the treemap blocks?

  3. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like to handle very small values to ensure
  they are still visible in the treemap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the hierarchical structure within the categories?

  6. Would you like the treemap to include a legend or key to explain the color coding
  or size representation?

  7. Are there any specific categories or values you would like to highlight or emphasize
  in the treemap?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-and-dice)?

  9. Should the treemap include tooltips with additional information when hovering
  over blocks?

  10. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the treemap?'
