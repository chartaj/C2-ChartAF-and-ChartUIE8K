initial_prompt: Let's create a column chart using data columns 0 through 23. This
  chart should display the values from each column, vividly highlighting the significant
  data points. Use text annotations to label key values that stand out and might be
  of interest. The purpose is to visually grasp the trends and differences across
  all these columns, so be sure to apply color coding or other visual effects to distinguish
  more important data points. The visualization will help in understanding the variation
  and distribution within the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences or specific color schemes you''d
  like to use for the chart?

  2. Are there specific columns you want to particularly highlight with distinct colors
  or effects?

  3. What type of text annotations would you prefer for labeling key values (e.g.,
  specific font size, style, or color)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s layout, such as bar width or spacing
  between columns?

  5. Would you like a legend included in the chart to explain the color coding or
  other visual effects used?

  6. Do you want gridlines or axis labels, and if so, how would you like them styled
  (e.g., line type, color, or thickness)?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the chart, axes, or
  data series?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the background color or style of the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any highlights or markers for trends or patterns observed
  in the data?'
