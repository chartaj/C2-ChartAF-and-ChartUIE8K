initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the data from '502.csv'. The heatmap should
  visualize the correlation between the different columns labeled '0' to '23'. Ensure
  that each cell in the heatmap represents the correlation value between the respective
  columns. The color intensity should represent the strength of the correlation, with
  different colors for positive and negative correlations. Include proper labels for
  the X and Y axes to indicate the column names, and add a color bar to interpret
  the correlation values more easily. The heatmap should help in identifying the relationships
  and patterns between the features in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  positive and negative correlations?

  2. Would you prefer a specific range for the color scale, or should it automatically
  adjust based on the data?

  3. Do you want grid lines between the cells for better visibility of individual
  correlations?

  4. Should the correlation values be displayed within the cells of the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the labels on the X and Y axes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the color bar (horizontal or
  vertical)?

  7. Should the color bar have specific labels or annotations to make interpretation
  easier?

  8. Do you prefer a specific size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. It should automatically adjust based on the data.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, display the correlation values within the cells.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Vertical orientation for the color bar.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have any preference.'
