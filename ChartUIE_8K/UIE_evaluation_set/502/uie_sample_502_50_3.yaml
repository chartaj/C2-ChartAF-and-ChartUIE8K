initial_prompt: Create a Treemap from `sample_data`, using columns '1', '2', '3',
  '4', and '5' to represent different sections with their respective values. Each
  column should be a separate category for visual comparison of their magnitude.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different sections
  in the Treemap?

  2. How would you like the labels to be displayed on the Treemap (e.g., inside the
  sections, outside, hidden)?

  3. Should each section of the Treemap have a specific border or shadow effect?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text within the Treemap?

  5. Do you want to include a legend explaining the categories, and if so, where should
  it be placed?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or tooltips for detailed values
  when hovering over sections?

  7. Should the Treemap be scaled according to the absolute values or in a normalized
  manner?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout algorithm for the Treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-and-dice, binary)?

  9. Is there a maximum or minimum size for each section that you have in mind?

  10. Would you like any additional visual aids such as grid lines or guides to enhance
  comparison by factor?'
