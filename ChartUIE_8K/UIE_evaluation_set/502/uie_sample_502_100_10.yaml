initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the data from 502.csv. Display the first
  three rows of data across all columns (0 to 23). Label the x-axis with 'Data Points',
  where each point represents a different column (from 0 to 23). The y-axis should
  represent the values from the sample data. Use different colors for each row to
  clearly differentiate them in the chart. The chart should help visualize the variation
  in values across different data columns for the first three rows. Additionally,
  include a legend to identify each row.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each row, or should
  we use default colors?

  2. Would you prefer specific labels for each row in the legend, or should we label
  them as ''Row 1'', ''Row 2'', and ''Row 3''?

  3. Do you want any particular font style or size for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  4. Should we add any title to the chart? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Do you have any preferences for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart?

  7. Do you need specific formatting for the numbers on the y-axis (e.g., decimal
  places, comma separators)?

  8. Should we include any annotations or data labels on the bars themselves for better
  clarity?

  9. Do you have any preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?'

  2. Label them as ''Row 1'', ''Row 2'', and ''Row 3''.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  4. I do not need a title.

  5. I do not know, default bar width and spacing are okay.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines on the chart.

  7. I am not sure, default formatting is okay.

  8. I do not need annotations or data labels on the bars.
