initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the columns
  in the dataset. Ensure all columns, including ''Unnamed: 0'', are included. Use
  color gradients to represent the strength of correlation between pairs.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient or color scheme to
  represent the correlation strength?

  2. Would you like to display correlation values within the heatmap cells, or should
  there only be color gradients?

  3. Is there a specific title or labeling scheme you prefer for the heatmap?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or the orientation of the labels
  (horizontal or vertical)?

  5. Should the heatmap include annotations, such as a legend to explain the color
  gradient?

  6. Are there specific ranges or thresholds for the correlation that you would like
  to highlight?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color gradient.

  6. I am not sure.'
