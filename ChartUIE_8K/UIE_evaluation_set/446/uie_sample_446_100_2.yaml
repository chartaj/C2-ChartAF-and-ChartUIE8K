initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of animal rescues
  by borough and year. The x-axis should show different boroughs, and the y-axis should
  display the number of incidents. Each bar group should represent a different year
  (cal_year). Add text annotations on bars that have the highest and lowest rescue
  counts to highlight significant data points. This will help in understanding the
  distribution of animal rescues across boroughs and changes over years. Use vibrant
  colors to distinguish between different years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you would
  like to use for each year?

  2. Should the text annotations for the highest and lowest rescue counts include
  both the number and the year?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels, legend, and annotations?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability? If yes, would
  you prefer them to be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order in which the boroughs are displayed on
  the x-axis? For example, alphabetical or by rescue count?

  6. Should the years be displayed in ascending or descending order within each bar
  group?

  7. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, please provide
  the text.

  8. Should there be a legend indicating which colors correspond to which years?

  9. Do you prefer bars to be labeled at the center or at the end of each bar?

  10. Would you like any additional annotations or markers, such as overall trends
  or outliers, to be highlighted in the chart?'
