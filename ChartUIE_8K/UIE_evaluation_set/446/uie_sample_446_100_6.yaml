initial_prompt: I need a histogram that uses the data related to animal rescues from
  the provided dataset. Specifically, I want to visualize the distribution of "incident_notional_cost"
  for these animal rescues. Could you create a histogram that shows how frequently
  different ranges of incident notional costs occur? This will help me understand
  the cost implications of various animal rescue operations. Make sure to label the
  x-axis as "Incident Notional Cost" and the y-axis as "Frequency." Please use appropriate
  bins to show a clear distribution of the costs. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific number of bins in mind for the histogram, or
  would you prefer an automatically calculated optimal number of bins?

  2. Are there any specific ranges of incident notional costs that you are particularly
  interested in highlighting?

  3. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  4. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, please provide the
  title.

  5. Should any specific annotations or labels be added to the chart to emphasize
  key points or ranges?

  6. Do you prefer the histogram to have a grid for easier readability?

  7. Do you want to see additional statistical details, such as mean or median, displayed
  on the histogram?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the x-axis and y-axis labels
  (e.g., font size, font type, color)?

  9. Would you like the y-axis to display absolute frequencies or relative frequencies
  (percentages)?

  10. Is there any need to use logarithmic scale for either axis to handle wide range
  of values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Incident Notional Costs for Animal
  Rescues".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a grid for easier readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have specific formatting preferences.

  9. Absolute frequencies are preferred.

  10. I am not sure.'
