initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the data on animal rescues by the London
  Fire Brigade. The x-axis should represent different types of incidents, and the
  y-axis should show the various boroughs. The color intensity should reflect the
  number of incidents recorded. Use the column 'borough' for y-axis data and 'type_of_incident'
  for x-axis data. Ensure to include labels and a legend for clarity. Filter out columns
  with high missing values such as 'uprn' for better accuracy. Adjust the resolution
  to clearly display smaller categories. Highlight correlations between locations
  and incident types.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. What title would you like for the heatmap?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size for the labels
  and legend?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  5. How would you prefer smaller categories to be displayed for better resolution?

  6. Should there be any specific annotation to highlight key data points or correlations?

  7. Is there a specific range for the color intensity that you would like to set?

  8. Do you want the data values to be displayed within each cell of the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to include any additional information or specific notes on the
  heatmap for context?

  10. Are there any specific boroughs or incident types you want to emphasize further
  on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. The title can be "Animal Rescues by the London Fire Brigade".

  3. I am not sure about the font style and size, just make sure they are clear and
  readable.

  4. I do not know if grid lines are necessary.

  5. I am not sure how smaller categories should be displayed; maybe an expert can
  decide.

  6. I am not sure about specific annotations; highlight the key data points if necessary.

  7. I do not have a specific range for the color intensity.

  8. Yes, please display the data values within each cell of the heatmap.

  9. I do not have any additional information or specific notes to include.

  10. No, I do not have specific boroughs or incident types to emphasize further.'
