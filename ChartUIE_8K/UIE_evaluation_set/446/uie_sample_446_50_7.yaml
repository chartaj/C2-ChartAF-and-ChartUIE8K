initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the frequency of animal rescue
  incidents. Use latitude and longitude data to plot rescue locations over time. Highlight
  areas with high incident density.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want specific time intervals highlighted (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  3. Should we include tooltips or labels for specific data points when hovered over?

  4. Is there a specific geographic boundary you would like to focus on (e.g., city
  limits)?

  5. Do you want the density of incidents to be represented by varying color intensities
  or another method?

  6. Would you like to see a legend that indicates the density range for the heatmap?

  7. Are there additional data attributes you want to overlay or filter by (e.g.,
  type of incident)?

  8. Should certain areas or regions be annotated or highlighted for emphasis?'
