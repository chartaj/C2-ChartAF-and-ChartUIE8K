initial_prompt: I have a dataset of animal rescue incidents in London, including details
  like incident number, location coordinates (latitude, longitude), and costs. I'd
  like a scatter plot visualizing the location of these rescues on a map of London.
  The x-axis should represent the longitude and the y-axis, the latitude. Each point
  should represent a rescue incident, possibly color-coded by the type of animal rescued.
  This visualization will help understand the geographic distribution of animal rescue
  operations. Please make sure the map is clear, and the points are easily distinguishable.
  Additionally, show major borough boundaries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to represent different
  types of animals in the scatter plot?

  2. What level of detail do you prefer for the map? Should it include topographical
  features, street names, or landmarks?

  3. How would you prefer the major borough boundaries to be displayed (solid line,
  dashed line, different colors, etc.)?

  4. Would you like any specific labeling for the boroughs or key locations on the
  map?

  5. Should there be a legend included to explain the color-coding of different types
  of animals and other map features?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size of the points representing rescue incidents
  on the map?

  7. Are there any specific boroughs or areas you would like to highlight or zoom
  into on the map?

  8. Is there a particular background style you prefer for the map (light, dark, satellite
  view, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Solid line for the major borough boundaries would be fine.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color-coding of different types of
  animals and other map features.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. A light background style would be preferred for the map.'
