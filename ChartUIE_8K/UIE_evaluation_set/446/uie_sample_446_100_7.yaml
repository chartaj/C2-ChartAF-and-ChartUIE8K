initial_prompt: I need a geographic heatmap showing the locations of animal rescue
  incidents from the data provided. The heatmap should display data points using the
  latitude and longitude values from each incident and highlight areas with higher
  rescue activity. Please ensure that the map is color-coded to show the density of
  incidents, with warmer colors indicating higher numbers of rescues. Incorporate
  details like type of incident, property type, and borough to provide additional
  context. It's important to visualize hotspots within the boroughs mentioned in the
  data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the map focus on specific boroughs or display all boroughs uniformly?

  3. Do you want to emphasize any specific type of incident or property type in the
  visualization?

  4. Would you prefer to include an interactive legend explaining the different colors
  representing the density of incidents?

  5. Is there a specific base map style (e.g., satellite view, street view) you would
  like to use for the background?

  6. Do you want to include tooltips or labels on the map to provide additional information
  when hovering over points?

  7. Should the heatmap display be normalized per borough, or should it show absolute
  counts?

  8. Are there any specific time ranges or periods you want to filter or emphasize
  in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Display all boroughs uniformly.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Street view.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Show absolute counts.

  8. I am not sure.'
