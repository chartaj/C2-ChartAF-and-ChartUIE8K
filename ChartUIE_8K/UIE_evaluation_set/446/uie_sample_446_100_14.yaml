initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart showing the distribution of special service
  types for animal rescues. Use 'special_service_type' for the labels on the y-axis
  and the count of each 'special_service_type' on the x-axis. Each lollipop should
  represent a unique 'special_service_type' with the stem length proportional to its
  count. Highlight different 'special_service_type_category' with distinct colors.

  provided. Ensure the chart is clear, with labels and legends for easy interpretation.
