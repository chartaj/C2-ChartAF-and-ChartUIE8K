initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the number of animal rescues per
  borough. Use data from the "borough" and "type_of_incident" columns. Additionally,
  differentiate types of animal groups within each borough by using different colors
  or patterns. Include a legend for clarity, and ensure each column represents a different
  borough. Title the chart "Animal Rescues by Borough" and label the axes appropriately.
  The X-axis should list the boroughs, and the Y-axis should represent the number
  of rescues. Include a tooltip to show the count of each specific animal group when
  hovering over the columns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  animal groups?

  between animal groups within boroughs?

  3. What font style and size would you like to use for the chart title and axis labels?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the boroughs to be presented
  on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by frequency of rescues)?

  5. Would you like the columns to have any specific spacing or width?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the legend (e.g., placement, orientation)?'
