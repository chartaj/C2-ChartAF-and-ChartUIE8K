initial_prompt: I want to visualize animal data using a scatter plot with highlighted
  annotations. The dataset includes information on animals like height, weight, and
  average speed. Each point on the scatter plot should represent an animal, with height
  (cm) on the x-axis and weight (kg) on the y-axis. Annotations should highlight specific
  data points like "African Elephant" and "Aardvark" to show their unique attributes
  such as top speed and lifespan. The annotations and highlights will help focus attention
  on certain animals for educational and comparative purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme or theme of the scatter
  plot?

  2. What specific details would you like included in the annotations for the highlighted
  animals?

  3. Do you want the annotations to include additional styling, such as arrows or
  different font sizes?

  4. Should there be a legend to explain the colors or symbols used in the plot?

  5. Are there any specific ranges for height and weight that you want the axes to
  be limited to?

  6. What level of detail do you want in the tooltips when hovering over other data
  points?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the scatter plot?

  9. Should the points representing animals be sized or styled differently based on
  any other attribute (e.g., Top Speed)?

  10. Are there any specific chart titles or axis labels you would like to use?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I would like the annotations to include the top speed and lifespan of the highlighted
  animals.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful to explain the colors or symbols used.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Gridlines should be included.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. The chart title can be "Animal Comparison: Height vs. Weight," and the axis
  labels can be "Height (cm)" for the x-axis and "Weight (kg)" for the y-axis.'
