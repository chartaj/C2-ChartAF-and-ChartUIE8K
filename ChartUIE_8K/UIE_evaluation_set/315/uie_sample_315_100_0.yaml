initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the average lifespan and top speed of various
  animals from the provided dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the animals
  with the longest lifespan and the highest top speed. Additionally, apply highlight
  annotations to distinguish endangered species by using a different color. The chart
  should provide a clear comparison of the lifespan and speed of each animal while
  emphasizing those that are particularly noteworthy for their longevity or quickness,
  and also identifying those with vulnerable conservation status.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the bars representing different
  attributes such as lifespan and top speed?

  2. Should the bars for endangered species be a specific color? If yes, please specify.

  3. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical bar chart layout?

  4. Do you have any font preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for easier comparison?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the bar thickness?

  7. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding and annotations?

  8. Do you have a preference for the placement of the text annotations (e.g., inside
  the bar, above the bar)?

  9. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  10. Are there any specific labels or units you would like to be used on the x-axis
  and y-axis?'
