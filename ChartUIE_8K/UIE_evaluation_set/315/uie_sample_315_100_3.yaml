initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing various animal-related information, including
  conservation status, diet, and habitat characteristics. I would like to visualize
  this data effectively. Could you create a pie chart that depicts the distribution
  of animals based on their conservation status, such as 'Least Concern', 'Vulnerable',
  and other categories? Additionally, provide a separate pie chart showcasing the
  distribution of animals based on their diet, like 'Insectivore', 'Herbivore', etc.
  This will help in understanding the conservation needs and dietary habits of these
  animals.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors or color schemes for the pie charts?

  2. Should the pie charts include data labels showing the percentage of each category?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to include legends specifying the categories?

  4. Would you like the pie charts to have titles? If so, please specify the titles.

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the categories to be displayed?

  6. Should the pie charts include a 3D effect or remain as a 2D representation?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific categories or sections within the pie
  charts?

  9. Should the charts be displayed side-by-side or one below the other?'
