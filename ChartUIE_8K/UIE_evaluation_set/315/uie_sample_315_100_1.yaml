initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the height and weight distribution
  of different animals from the dataset. Highlight specific box plots to show the
  average speed and lifespan of these animals. Use text annotations to display notable
  data points like the top speed, predator information, and conservation status. This
  chart will help compare physical attributes and survival traits across various species,
  which is valuable for zoological research and conservation efforts. Ensure the chart
  is clear and highlights the differences in the physical attributes and lifestyles
  of these animals.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the box plots to have specific colors for different animals or
  categories?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed: inside the box plots,
  outside, or both?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the different attributes and their
  corresponding colors/symbols?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout for the chart (e.g., horizontal or vertical box
  plots)?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  8. Should the box plots be displayed with or without outliers?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and titles?

  10. Would you like any additional markers or lines (e.g., mean, median) to be displayed
  on the box plots?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Outside the box plots.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. With outliers displayed.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, including the median would be good.'
