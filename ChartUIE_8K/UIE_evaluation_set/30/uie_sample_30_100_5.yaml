initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of the "MOSTYPE"
  column, which signifies different customer types in the Caravan Insurance Challenge
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the unique customer types (from 1 to 40), and
  the y-axis should show the count of instances for each type. This will help in understanding
  which customer types are more prevalent in the data. Make sure to include a title
  and labels for both axes to ensure clarity. Utilize the first few rows of data for
  accurate representation and to keep the chart simple and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for the bars?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the title and axis labels?

  4. Should there be any grid lines for better readability of the values on the y-axis?

  5. Do you want the exact count values to be displayed on top of each bar?

  such as ascending or descending order?
