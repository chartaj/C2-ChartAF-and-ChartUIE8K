initial_prompt: I want a pie chart that shows the distribution of different categories
  of Sanskrit words in Vedic literature. Please highlight categories that are associated
  with more than 100 words by changing their colors to make them stand out. Additionally,
  add text annotations to display the exact number of unique words for these highlighted
  categories. This will help in understanding the prominence of certain types of words
  in this context. Make sure the chart is clear and easy to interpret, emphasizing
  the importance of diverse categories in Sanskrit literature studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting categories with
  more than 100 words?

  2. Would you like the text annotations to be displayed in a specific font style
  or size?

  3. Do you prefer the pie chart to have a 3D effect or stay flat?

  4. Should the labels for each category be placed inside or outside the pie chart
  slices?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the categories to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by number of words)?

  6. Would you like a legend included in the pie chart, and if so, do you have a preference
  for its placement?'
