initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Visualize the diversity of Sanskrit words used in Vedic literature using a heatmap.
  The heatmap should focus on the frequency and categorization of words based on ''category'',
  ''description'', ''nagari'', and ''word'' columns. Highlight regions with high frequency
  to show linguistic richness. Use text annotations to explain significant words or
  categories. This will help in understanding the usage patterns and significance
  of specific terms in Vedic texts. Aim to make the visualization clear and focused,
  ensuring that it draws attention to noteworthy data points and patterns.
