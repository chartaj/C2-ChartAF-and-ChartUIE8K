initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the frequency of unique values in
  the 'category' and 'description' columns from the dataset "Sanskrit Words in Vedic
  Literature". The x-axis should represent the different categories and descriptions
  from the data, while the y-axis should show the count of unique values within each
  category and description. The chart should help in understanding how terms related
  to different categories of grass are distributed in Vedic literature. Ensure the
  chart is clear and labeled appropriately for easy interpretation.
