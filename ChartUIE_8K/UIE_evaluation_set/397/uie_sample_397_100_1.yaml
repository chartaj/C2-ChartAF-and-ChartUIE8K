initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that shows the interaction between major tech companies
  like Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Use data annotations
  to highlight key data points, especially where interactions have higher or lower
  values, to draw attention to these details. Employ highlights to distinguish significant
  elements visually. This visualization aims to provide an insightful overview of
  how these companies compare and interact, focusing on patterns of competition or
  cooperation in the tech industry for better understanding and analysis.
