initial_prompt: 'Iâ€™d like a treemap visualization showing the interactions between
  major tech companies: Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. The
  dataset contains columns with company names and numerical values representing interactions
  between them. Each cell should reflect the interaction intensity, and the entire
  treemap should be colored accordingly to easily differentiate high and low interaction
  zones. Clear labels are essential for understanding. This analysis is crucial for
  identifying strategic partnerships and competition within the technology sector.
  Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for distinguishing high
  and low interaction zones?

  2. Should the color gradient be sequential or diverging to represent interaction
  intensity?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for labels to ensure clarity?

  4. Would you like the labels to include exact numerical values of interactions,
  or just the company names?

  5. Is there any preference for the layout of the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice,
  strip)?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to certain
  interactions or companies?

  7. Should the treemap include a legend to explain the color coding for interaction
  intensity?'
