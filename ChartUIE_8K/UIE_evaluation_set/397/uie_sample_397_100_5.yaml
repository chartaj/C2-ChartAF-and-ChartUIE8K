initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the revenue transactions between these
  tech companies. Each bar should represent a company (Apple, Samsung, Microsoft,
  Google, Amazon, Facebook) and display their transactions with each other. Use different
  colors for each company's transactions with others. Highlight the highest transaction
  between any two companies. Ensure the X-axis has the company names and the Y-axis
  shows the transaction values. This chart will help understand the financial relationships
  and transaction impacts among the leading tech companies for our annual financial
  analysis report.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used for different\
  \ companies' transactions?\n2. Do you want any specific labels or annotations on\
  \ the bars other than the transaction values?\n3. Is there a specific style or theme\
  \ you prefer for the bar chart (e.g., modern, classic, minimalistic)?\n4. Would\
  \ you like to include a legend to differentiate the colors representing each company's\
  \ transactions?\n5. Do you prefer the bars to be clustered or stacked for each company?\n\
  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the font style and size for the axis\
  \ labels and titles?\n7. Should the chart include grid lines for easier comparison\
  \ of transaction values?\n8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the\
  \ companies to appear on the X-axis? \n9. Would you like to add any additional data\
  \ points, such as total transactions per company, for further comparison?\n10. Should\
  \ the highlight for the highest transaction be a specific color or pattern?"
