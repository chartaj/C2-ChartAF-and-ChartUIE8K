initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the trends in the number
  of Nobel Prize laureates broken down by gender across different years. Use the 'prize_year'
  on the x-axis and the count of 'laureate_id' grouped by 'gender' on the y-axis.
  This will help us observe any changes in gender representation over time. Ensure
  the line chart clearly distinguishes between male and female laureates with different
  colors for each gender line. Add appropriate labels for the axes and provide a legend
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the lines representing
  male and female laureates?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart? If so, do you have any
  specific preferences for their appearance?

  4. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  5. Would you like to see data points marked on the lines? If so, do you have a preference
  for the style of these markers?

  6. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the legend?

  7. Do you prefer a specific date range to be emphasized on the x-axis (e.g., a certain
  start and end year)?

  8. Is there a specific arrangement or ordering you prefer for the gender lines in
  the legend?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the background color or overall theme of the
  chart?'
