initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the birth countries of Nobel Prize
  laureates from 1901. Use different shades to represent the number of laureates born
  in each country. Highlight countries with high laureate counts for emphasis. Include
  text annotations for select countries to display exact numbers. This will support
  analyzing patterns of Nobel Prize distribution by geography, focusing on male dominance
  as the dataset mostly mentions men. Ensure the visualization effectively communicates
  where Nobel laureates are predominantly born, aligning with social-science studies
  on gender distribution and geographic origins.
