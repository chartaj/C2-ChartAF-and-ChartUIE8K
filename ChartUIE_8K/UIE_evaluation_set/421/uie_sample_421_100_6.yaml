initial_prompt: I have Nobel prize data from a CSV file. I want to create a histogram
  to visualize the gender distribution among Nobel laureates over the years. The x-axis
  should represent different decades starting from 1901. The y-axis should show the
  count of laureates. The columns to consider are 'prize_year', 'gender', and 'laureate_id'.
  Since my focus is on the male dominance topic, please differentiate between male
  and female laureates in the histogram, perhaps using different colors or labels.
  This will help in understanding the trend of gender distribution over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating male and female
  laureates?

  2. Would you like specific labels or legends for male and female categories? If
  so, any preferences?

  3. Should the x-axis be labeled with specific decade names or numeric year ranges?

  4. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier readability?

  6. Do you have any preferences for bar spacing or width in the histogram?

  7. Are there any particular chart titles or subtitles you have in mind?

  8. Do you want to highlight or annotate any significant trends or decades on the
  chart?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the male and female laureates'' data
  to be displayed (e.g., males first, then females, or side by side)?

  10. Do you need any additional information or statistics, such as percentages, to
  be displayed on the chart?'
