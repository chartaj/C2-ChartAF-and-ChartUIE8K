initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Nobel Prize winners by birth country
  and birth year. Highlight male laureates to emphasize the male dominance in Nobel
  Prizes. Include data-driven text annotations for notable winning years and changes
  in trends. Highlight specific elements by modifying appearance, such as color for
  birth countries with most laureates. Add non-data-driven annotations to provide
  historical context and significant world events influencing the awards. This visualization
  aims to show the distribution, gender disparity, and how historical contexts affect
  Nobel laureate statistics. Use given data formats and details for accurate representation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight male
  laureates and countries with the most laureates?

  2. Would you like the scatter plot to display markers of different shapes or sizes
  to distinguish between male and female laureates?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for text annotations highlighting notable winning
  years and trend changes?

  4. How would you like the non-data-driven annotations to be displayed for historical
  context and significant world events? (e.g., annotations with icons, footnotes,
  or sidebars)

  5. Are there any specific historical events you want to ensure are included in the
  non-data-driven annotations?

  6. What level of detail should be included in data-driven text annotations? (e.g.,
  brief summaries or detailed explanations)

  7. Do you have a preference for the layout and positioning of the legend and axis
  labels on the scatter plot?

  8. Would you like to include any interactive elements such as tooltips for additional
  information on hover? (Note: This is about appearance rather than interactivity
  features)

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style and size used for text annotations
  and labels on the chart?

  10. Should the scatter plot include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability,
  and if so, how would you like them styled?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; you can choose what looks best
  for highlighting purposes.

  2. I do not know; I have no specific preference for marker shapes or sizes.

  3. Brief summaries would be preferable for the text annotations highlighting notable
  winning years and trend changes.

  4. I would like the non-data-driven annotations to be displayed as sidebars.

  5. I am not sure; maybe include major war periods and economic events?

  6. Brief summaries should suffice for the data-driven text annotations.

  7. I have no specific preference for the layout and positioning of the legend and
  axis labels.

  8. I do not need any interactive elements; just the appearance you think is effective.

  9. I have no specific preference regarding the font style and size.

  10. Yes, include gridlines to enhance readability, styled in a subtle manner.'
