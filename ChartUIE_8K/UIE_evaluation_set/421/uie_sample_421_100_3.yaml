initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the male dominance in Nobel Prize awards.
  Use the data on Nobel Prize laureates from the CSV file to show the ratio of male
  to female winners across different prize categories and years. The x-axis should
  represent the prize year, and the y-axis should represent the prize categories (e.g.,
  Chemistry, Literature, Medicine). The heatmap should indicate the number of male
  and female laureates, with different colors representing males and females. Ensure
  the color intensity reflects the count of laureates. This will help to highlight
  gender disparity in Nobel Prize awards.

  laureates?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for indicating the intensity of laureates''
