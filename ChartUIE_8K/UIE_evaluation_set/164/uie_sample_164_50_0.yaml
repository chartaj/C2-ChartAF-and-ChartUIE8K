initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the "Total Amount Spent
  to Influence" over time from the lobbyist reports. Use text annotations to highlight
  specific points, like when amendments were filed. Additionally, show which reports
  are filed by "Corporations" with distinct colors. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences to distinguish reports filed\
  \ by \"Corporations\"?\n2. Would you like specific color codes for different types\
  \ of expenditures or just a single color for all \"Corporations\"?\n3. Do you prefer\
  \ any particular style or size for the text annotations highlighting the amendments?\n\
  4. Should the text annotations include just the date of the amendment or any additional\
  \ information?\n5. Is there a specific date format you prefer to be shown on the\
  \ x-axis for the \"Date Filed\"?\n6. Would you like to include gridlines in the\
  \ scatter plot for better readability?\n7. Do you have a preference for the range\
  \ of values displayed on the y-axis for \"Total Amount Spent to Influence\"?\n8.\
  \ Is there a specific plot title or labels for x-axis and y-axis that you would\
  \ like to be included? \n9. Would you like to include a legend explaining the colors\
  \ used in the scatter plot?"
