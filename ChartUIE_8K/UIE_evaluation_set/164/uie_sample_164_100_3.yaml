initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart visualizing the total amount spent
  to influence by each lobbyist over the different filing periods. For each lobbyist,
  display the expenditures as bars grouped by period start date. Make sure the lobbyist
  names are properly consolidated where there are variations (e.g., "Airbnb Inc,"
  "Airbnb Inc.," and "Airbnb, Inc." should be treated as one). Additionally, include
  tooltips to show detailed information for each bar, such as the exact amount, report
  type, and period end date.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different filing periods?

  2. Would you prefer a specific order for displaying the lobbyists on the axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by total amount spent, etc.)?

  3. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted for better readability (e.g.,
  date formats, number formats)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include a legend that specifies the filing periods by color?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the tooltips to be formatted (e.g., order
  of information, additional details)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the overall design theme of the chart (e.g., modern,
  classic, minimalistic)?'
