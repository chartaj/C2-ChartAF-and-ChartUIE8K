initial_prompt: I need a table chart for the "Expenditure Lobbyists Registration,
  Monthly Report" dataset. The chart should list all lobbyist names, their report
  types, the dates filed, periods covered, activities, terminations, amendments, types
  of expenditure lobbyists, and total amounts spent to influence. Ensure the table
  is easy to read and highlights missing values clearly. Include columns for unique
  attributes like amendment filings and report file details if possible. This will
  help track lobbying activities and expenditures over time for each entity listed.
  Make sure it is suitable for presentations or detailed reviews.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred font size or style for the table text to ensure
  readability during presentations?

  2. Would you like specific rows or columns to be color-coded or highlighted for
  emphasis?

  3. Should missing values be indicated with a special character or text, such as
  ''N/A'' or ''Missing''?

  4. Do you prefer any particular layout for the table, such as horizontal or vertical
  scrolling?

  5. Are there any specific colors you would like used for highlighting missing values?

  6. Would you like any specific column ordering within the table?

  7. Should the table include sorting or filtering capabilities for each column?

  8. Do you want the table to include any summary rows or columns to show totals or
  averages?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the dates formatted (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY,
  DD/MM/YYYY)?

  10. Are there any specific visual separators (like borders or grid lines) you prefer
  for the table?'
