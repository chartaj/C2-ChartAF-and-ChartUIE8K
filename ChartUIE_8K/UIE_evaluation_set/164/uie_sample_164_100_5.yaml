initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the total amount spent to influence lobbying
  activities over time. Use the "Date Filed" on the x-axis and "Total Amount Spent
  to Influence" on the y-axis. Display separate lines for each unique "Lobbyist Name"
  to compare their lobbying expenditures. Include markers at each data point for clarity.
  Ensure labels and a legend to distinguish between the lobbyists. This will help
  visualize trends in lobbying spending by different corporations over the specified
  reporting periods.

  \ for each lobbyist?\n2. What style would you prefer for the markers (e.g., circles,\

  5. Do you need a grid for the chart? If so, should it be for both axes or just one?\n\
  6. Are there any specific label formats or font sizes you would prefer for the axes\
  \ and legend?\n7. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location\
  \ (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?\n8. Do you want to include any annotations or\
  \ specific data point labels on the chart? \n9. Should the chart include a title\
  \ or subtitle? If yes, do you have a preferred title or subtitle?\n10. Are there\
  \ any specific ranges or intervals you would like to set for the y-axis?"
