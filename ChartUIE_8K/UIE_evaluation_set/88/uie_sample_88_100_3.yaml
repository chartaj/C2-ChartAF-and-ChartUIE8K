initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize job salaries in the data science
  field. Use the 'salary_in_usd' on the y-axis and 'work_year' on the x-axis. Differentiate
  the points by 'job_category' using different colors. Additionally, use different
  shapes to represent 'experience_level'. This will allow me to see how salaries change
  over time across various data science job categories and experience levels. Please
  ensure to label the axes and include a legend for both job categories and experience
  levels for better understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the ''job_category''
  differentiation?

  2. Do you prefer any specific shapes for different ''experience_level'' representations?

  3. What title would you like to give to the scatter plot?

  4. Do you have any particular font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or data point labels on the scatter
  plot?

  6. Are there any specific axis ranges you would like to set for the x-axis (''work_year'')
  and y-axis (''salary_in_usd'')?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be light or bold?'
