initial_prompt: I want to visualize the average salary in USD across different job
  categories and experience levels in the data science field. Please create a grouped
  bar chart where the x-axis represents different job categories, and within each
  category, group the bars by experience levels (Mid-level, Senior, etc.). The y-axis
  should show the average salary in USD. Make sure each bar group is distinct and
  easy to compare. Title the chart "Average Salary by Job Category and Experience
  Level in Data Science". Use different colors for each experience level for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette you prefer for different experience
  levels?

  2. Would you like the bars within each job category to be displayed side by side
  or stacked?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the chart title and axis
  labels?

  4. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact average salary values
  on the bars?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for easier comparison of salary levels across
  categories and experience levels?

  6. Should there be a legend indicating which color corresponds to which experience
  level?

  7. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the job categories on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetically, by average salary, custom order)?

  8. Is there a specific range for the y-axis you want to set, or should it auto-adjust
  based on the data?'
