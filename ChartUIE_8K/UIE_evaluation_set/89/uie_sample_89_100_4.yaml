initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for the machine predictive maintenance classification
  data. Use "Rotational speed [rpm]" on the x-axis and "Torque [Nm]" on the y-axis.
  Also, add a color code to differentiate between different "Failure Type" categories.
  The scatter plot should help visualize how the rotational speed and torque are associated
  with different failure types to better analyze the conditions that lead to machine
  failures. If possible, include markers or symbols that represent different "Product
  ID" types for more detailed insights. This will help identify trends and anomalies
  in machine performance. Thanks!
questions: '1. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the "Failure Type" categories?

  3. Would you prefer certain shapes for markers/symbols representing different "Product
  ID" types?

  4. Is there a particular range or scale you would like to set for the x-axis (Rotational
  speed [rpm])?

  5. Is there a particular range or scale you would like to set for the y-axis (Torque
  [Nm])?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  7. Should the axis titles include measurement units (e.g., "Rotational speed [rpm]"
  and "Torque [Nm]")?

  8. Do you have any specific legend preferences or positioning for the legend on
  the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like to include data point labels for better identification of specific
  points?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to include in
  the plot (e.g., annotations, trend lines)?'
