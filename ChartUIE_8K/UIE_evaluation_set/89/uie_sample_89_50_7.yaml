initial_prompt: Please visualize the air and process temperatures (K) over time using
  a dual-axis line chart. This would help in predicting machine maintenance needs
  by identifying any correlations between temperature variations and potential failures.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color schemes for the dual-axis line chart?

  2. Would you like to see grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed)
  for each temperature type?

  4. Should we include data point markers on the lines, and if so, what style do you
  prefer?

  5. How would you like the axes to be labeled?

  6. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers for certain data points on
  the chart?

  8. Should there be any particular title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and titles?

  10. Do you want the chart to display a specific time range or include all available
  data points?'
