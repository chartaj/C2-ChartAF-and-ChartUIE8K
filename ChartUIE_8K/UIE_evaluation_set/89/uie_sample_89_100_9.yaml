initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that visualizes the average air temperature
  (in Kelvin) and process temperature (in Kelvin) for each product type (L, M, and
  H). Include separate bars for air temperature and process temperature for each product
  type. This will help in understanding the temperature variations across different
  product types. Ensure that the chart is clear, with well-labeled axes and a legend
  to distinguish between air temperature and process temperature. This will be used
  for machine predictive maintenance classification analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the bars representing air
  temperature and process temperature?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show the exact values?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart''s background color or gridlines?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to be included in
  the chart?

  8. Would you prefer a certain order for displaying the product types on the x-axis
  (e.g., L, M, H, or any other order)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color preference.

  2. The title could be "Average Air and Process Temperatures by Product Type".

  3. The x-axis should be labeled "Product Type", and the y-axis should be labeled
  "Temperature (K)".

  4. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  5. Yes, please include data labels on the bars to show the exact values.

  6. I do not have any specific requirements for the background color or gridlines.

  7. I do not know about any additional annotations or notes.

  8. The order L, M, H would be fine.'
