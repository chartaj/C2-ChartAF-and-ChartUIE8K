initial_prompt: I'd like to generate a stacked column chart for our Machine Predictive
  Maintenance Classification data. Specifically, I want the x-axis to represent the
  'Product ID' and the y-axis to show 'Torque [Nm]' values. Each column should be
  stacked by 'Failure Type.' Within each 'Product ID,' I want to visualize the proportion
  of each 'Failure Type' contributing to the total 'Torque [Nm].' Please ensure the
  chart is color-coded for each 'Failure Type' so that it's easy to differentiate
  between them. Title the chart "Torque Distribution by Failure Type and Product ID."
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different ''Failure Type''
  categories?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Should there be any specific labels or annotations on the chart beyond the standard
  axis labels?

  4. Do you want to display the exact values of ''Torque [Nm]'' on the chart bars
  or keep it clean without data labels?

  5. Is there any specific order you would like the ''Product ID'' categories to be
  displayed in on the x-axis?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart title and labels?

  7. Are there any legends or keys that you would like to customize or position differently
  on the chart?

  8. Would you like to apply any specific formatting to the y-axis (such as setting
  a range or using log scale)?'
