initial_prompt: 'I want to visualize the trends of different operational parameters
  over time to monitor machine performance and predict maintenance needs. Specifically,
  create a line chart for each parameter: ''Air temperature [K]'', ''Process temperature
  [K]'', ''Rotational speed [rpm]'', ''Torque [Nm]'', and ''Tool wear [min]''. Include
  a time-based x-axis using ''UDI'' as a proxy for time. Also, indicate points where
  ''Target'' value is 1 to highlight when a failure occurs. This should help in understanding
  the patterns leading to failures.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the lines for each
  parameter?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the points where the ''Target'' value is 1 be indicated with a specific
  marker style or color?

  4. Do you prefer any specific line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for the different
  parameters?

  5. Would you like to see a legend on the chart to identify the different parameters?

  6. Should the chart include tooltips or annotations for the highlighted failure
  points?

  7. Do you have preferences for the scale and range of the y-axis for each line chart?

  8. Would you like to display any statistical summaries (such as mean, median) on
  the chart?

  9. Should the x-axis labels (UDI) be formatted in a specific way (e.g., rotated,
  in intervals)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for axis labels and titles?'
