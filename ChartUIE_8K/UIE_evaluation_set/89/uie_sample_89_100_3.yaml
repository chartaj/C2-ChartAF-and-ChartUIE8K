initial_prompt: Compare the number of unique values across columns, highlighting the
  differences between them. Use a bar chart with columns (e.g., UDI, Product ID, Type,
  etc.) on the x-axis and the number of unique values on the y-axis. This visualization
  will help us understand the distribution of unique values in the dataset, which
  is crucial for predictive maintenance classification in the context of machine performance
  and failure analysis. The bar chart should demonstrate if certain variables have
  significantly more or fewer unique values than others, aiding in feature selection
  for predictive modeling.
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bar chart?\n\
  2. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?\n3. Should\
  \ the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of values?\n4. Do you prefer\
  \ any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?\n5. Should there\
  \ be any specific annotations or labels on each bar to indicate the number of unique\
  \ values?\n6. Would you like a legend included, even if the chart has a single data\
  \ series?\n7. Do you have a preferred range or scaling for the y-axis?\n8. Should\
  \ the chart title include any specific text or description? \n9. Are there any additional\
  \ details or descriptions you would like to be included in the chart (e.g., data\
  \ source, date)?\n10. Would you prefer any additional visual elements, such as reference\
  \ lines or markers, to highlight certain values?"
