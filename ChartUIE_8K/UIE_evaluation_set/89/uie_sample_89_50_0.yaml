initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize torque variations in relation to different
  product types (M, L). Highlight any significant outliers in torque data. Use shapes
  to annotate important data points that indicate potential failure. This will help
  in predictive maintenance analysis.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific colors or themes for the box chart?

  2. How would you like the significant outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different
  colors, shapes)?

  3. What shapes do you prefer for annotating important data points indicating potential
  failure?

  4. Should the box chart include grid lines for easier reading?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the box chart (e.g.,
  horizontal or vertical)?

  6. Would you like to include legends or labels for the different categories and
  annotations?

  7. Do you want a title and axis labels? If yes, please provide them.

  8. How detailed should the tooltip information be when hovering over data points?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Different colors.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include legends or labels.

  7. Title: "Torque Variations by Product Type", Axis Labels: "Product Type (M, L)"
  and "Torque"

  8. I do not know.'
