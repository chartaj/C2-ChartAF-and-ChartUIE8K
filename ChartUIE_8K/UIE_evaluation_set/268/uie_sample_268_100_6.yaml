initial_prompt: "I'd like to visualize the population distribution of different districts\
  \ in Bangladesh over the years using a pie chart. \n\nPlease create pie charts for\
  \ each census year available (1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022). For each pie chart, show\
  \ the proportion of the population in each district. This will help in comparing\
  \ the growth and share of population in various districts over time. \n\nUse the\
  \ data provided for all the districts to generate these charts. Thank you!"
