initial_prompt: Please create a table chart that shows the population growth of different
  districts in Bangladesh from 1991 to 2022. Highlight the districts with the highest
  and lowest population in 2022. Add text annotations for these highlighted districts
  to display their population numbers and native names. This will help emphasize and
  understand the changes in population over the years in different regions. The table
  should include columns for the district name, abbreviation, division, established
  year, native name, area, and population for the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the districts
  with the highest and lowest population in 2022?

  2. Would you prefer the table chart to have a specific layout or order of columns?

  3. Should the columns be sortable, for example by population or by area?

  4. Do you want any additional visual elements such as grid lines, borders, or alternating
  row colors?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like to be used for the text
  annotations and table contents?

  6. How would you like the text annotations to be displayed, for example, in a tooltip
  or directly within the table cells?

  7. Do you prefer the native names to be displayed in a specific script or language?

  8. Are there any specific formats required for the numbers, such as comma separators
  or decimal precision?

  9. Would you like each division to be grouped or categorized in some way within
  the table?

  10. Do you have any preferences for how large the text annotations or highlighted
  areas should be for better visibility?'
