initial_prompt: Create a heatmap comparing male and female driving test results across
  different regions, using the provided dataset. Highlight regions with the highest
  and lowest average test scores and use annotations to mark these specific data points.
  Additionally, include annotations for any significant correlations between BMI,
  age, and test results. The purpose is to visualize any noticeable gender differences
  in test performance and any regional patterns, as well as understanding how factors
  like BMI and age might influence driving test outcomes. This will help in identifying
  trends and areas that may need attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the regions to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., alphabetically,
  by average test score)?

  3. How would you like the annotations for the highest and lowest average test scores
  to be styled (e.g., color, shape, size)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like to use for the text in
  the heatmap?

  6. How would you like the correlations between BMI, age, and test results to be
  represented (e.g., text annotations, lines, color gradients)?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to show absolute values or normalized values (e.g.,
  percentage, z-scores)?

  8. Would you like any additional legends or keys to be included in the heatmap for
  better understanding?

  9. Are there any specific region groupings you would like to highlight or focus
  on?

  10. What level of detail would you like in the annotations (e.g., numerical values,
  short descriptions, statistical significance)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the annotations to be styled with a noticeable color and slightly
  larger size for emphasis.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I prefer the correlations to be represented with text annotations.

  7. Normalized values would be preferred.

  8. Yes, please include additional legends or keys for better understanding.

  9. I do not have any specific preferences for region groupings.

  10. Numerical values along with statistical significance would be ideal.'
