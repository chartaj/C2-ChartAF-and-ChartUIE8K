  4. Should the regions be distinguished using different colors, line styles, or both?\n\
  5. How would you like age and BMI correlations to be visually represented (e.g.,\
  \ through color gradients, size of markers)?\n6. Would you like a legend included\
  \ in the chart, and if so, any specific location or style preferences for it?\n\
  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or formatting? \n8. Are there\
  \ any gridline or background preferences for making the chart clearer?\n9. Would\
