initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the hydrophobicity of proteins from Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa. Use the 'ID' on the y-axis and 'Hydrophobicity' values on the x-axis.
  Different colors should indicate the degree of hydrophobicity, with a gradient ranging
  from high (blue) to low (red). The heatmap should help in quickly identifying patterns
  or outliers in protein hydrophobicity levels. Include legends and axis labels for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap other than the
  specified blue to red gradient?

  2. What specific range of hydrophobicity values would you like to emphasize on the
  heatmap?

  3. Would you prefer a specific ordering method for the protein IDs on the y-axis?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legends?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size of the heatmap (e.g., dimensions or aspect
  ratio)?

  6. Should the heatmap include grid lines between cells for better readability?

  7. Do you want to display numerical values of hydrophobicity within each heatmap
  cell?

  8. Would you like to add additional annotations or markers to highlight significant
  patterns or outliers?

  9. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include for the
  heatmap?

  10. Do you require any additional information or context to be included in the legend?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  7. No, displaying numerical values within each cell is not necessary.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No specific titles or subtitles are needed.

  10. I do not require any additional information in the legend.'
