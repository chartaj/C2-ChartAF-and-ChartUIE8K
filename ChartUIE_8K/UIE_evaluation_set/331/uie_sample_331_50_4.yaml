initial_prompt: Create a box chart displaying the distribution of Molecular Weight
  and Isoelectric Point for Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins. Ensure axes are labeled
  and outliers are shown for detailed insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like each attribute (Molecular Weight and Isoelectric Point) to be
  displayed in separate charts or combined in one chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the attributes on the axes?

  4. Would you like the data points for outliers to be labeled?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like on the chart or axes?
