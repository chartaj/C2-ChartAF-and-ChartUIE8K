initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the Molecular_Weight of different proteins.
  Highlight proteins with a unique Name. Annotate with Protein_Length and Hydrophobicity.
  This visualization aims to compare proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa by their molecular
  weight while providing additional context through annotations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Do you want a particular style or format for highlighting proteins with unique
  Names?

  3. Where would you like the annotations for ''Protein_Length'' and ''Hydrophobicity''
  to be placed on the chart?

  4. Should the bars be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending or descending
  by ''Molecular_Weight'')?

  5. Do you have a specific preference for the chart''s title or labels for the axes?

  6. Would you like gridlines or background patterns in the chart?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, how would you like it configured?

  9. Would you like any specific tooltips or hover information to be displayed when
  interacting with the chart?

  10. Are there any other specific visual elements or styles you would like incorporated
  into the design?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the annotations placed above the bars.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. The chart''s title could be "Comparison of Protein Molecular Weights in Pseudomonas
  aeruginosa". Axis labels: X-axis - "Protein Name", Y-axis - "Molecular Weight".

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, the chart should include a legend indicating highlighted unique protein
  names.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
