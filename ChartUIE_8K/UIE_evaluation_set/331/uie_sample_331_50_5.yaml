initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between Molecular Weight,
  Isoelectric Point, Protein Length, and Hydrophobicity for different proteins in
  Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Highlight high correlation areas.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap to represent
  different correlation values?

  2. Would you like to add labels for the numerical correlation values on the heatmap
  cells?

  3. Should the heatmap include a color legend to indicate the range of correlation
  values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the specific colors to use for high correlation
  areas?

  5. Would you like the axes titles to be customized in any specific way?

  6. Do you want the plot to have grid lines to separate the cells, or should it be
  without grid lines?

  7. Should the heatmap have annotations to indicate the significance level of the
  correlations?

  8. Would you like any additional information (such as the sample size) to be included
  in the heatmap?'
