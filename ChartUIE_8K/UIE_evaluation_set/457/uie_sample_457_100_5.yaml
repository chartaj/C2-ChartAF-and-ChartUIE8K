initial_prompt: I have a dataset about browser market share, including different browsers,
  their versions, and corresponding data values. This data is under the category of
  computers and technology. I would like a stacked bar chart that visualizes the distribution
  of market share across the different versions of each browser. Each bar should represent
  a browser, with segments showing the versions and their respective data values stacked
  within that bar. This visualization should help to compare the browser versions
  and understand the overall market influence of each browser. Please make sure the
  chart is easy to read and interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different browser
  versions?

  2. Would you prefer specific font types or sizes for the labels and legends?

  3. Should the bars be displayed in a particular order, such as by browser or by
  market share value?

  4. Do you want to include data labels on each segment of the stacked bar for easier
  reading of values?

  5. Is there a specific way you want the axes to be labeled or titled?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to distinguish between the different browser versions?

  7. Are there any specific styling preferences for the chart, such as bar width or
  spacing between bars?

  8. Do you prefer any specific format for displaying the market share percentages
  (e.g., decimal places)?

  9. Are there any specific themes or styles that you want the chart to adhere to
  (e.g., minimalistic, vibrant)?

  10. Would you like to include a title for the chart, and if so, do you have a preferred
  title in mind?'
