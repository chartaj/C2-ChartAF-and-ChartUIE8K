initial_prompt: I have a dataset showing the browser market share with columns for
  Browser, Version, and Data. I'd like to visualize this data with a Donut chart.
  Each segment of the Donut chart should represent a different browser, and the size
  of the segment should reflect the market share data. Include versions as labels
  for more specificity. The chart should be clear and easy to understand, suitable
  for presentation purposes. Additionally, please make sure to label the chart appropriately
  and include a legend for clarity. This visualization will help in observing the
  distribution of various browser usages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or branding guidelines for the
  chart?

  2. Would you like the segments to display exact percentage values, labels, or both?

  3. How would you prefer the browser versions to be displayed on the chartâ€”next to
  each segment or within a legend?

  4. What title would you like to have for the chart?

  5. Are there any specific browsers or versions you want to highlight or differentiate
  in the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any additional descriptive text or annotations in the
  chart?'

  3. I do not know.
