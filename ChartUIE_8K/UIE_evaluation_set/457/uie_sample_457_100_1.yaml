initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize browser market share using the given
  data on browser, version, and data (usage percentage). Highlight browser versions
  with significant usage differences to draw attention to trends or outliers. Use
  text annotations to detail exact percentages for these highlighted versions to help
  understand market dominants and newcomers. The purpose of this visualization is
  to identify key market players and shifts in browser usage over time, within the
  computers-and-technology sector. This heatmap should make it easy for viewers to
  comprehend data at a glance and focus on important elements.

  6. Do you have any preference for the axis titles or labels?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color scale, and if so, where
  should it be positioned?

  highlighted or annotated?'
