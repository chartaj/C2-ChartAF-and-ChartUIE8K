initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the provided data focusing on agriculture,
  forestry, and fishing value added per worker over the years across different countries.
  Highlight countries with the highest and lowest values, and use text annotations
  for notable data points (e.g., significant increases or decreases, outliers). Ensure
  the heatmap clearly shows trends over time, helps identify countries with the best
  and worst performance, and provides insights into regional agriculture productivity.
  The purpose is to easily compare productivity among countries and observe temporal
  changes. Use the annotations to draw attention to key findings and patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the highlighted countries with the highest and lowest values
  to be visually represented?

  3. Do you have a specific style in mind for the text annotations of notable data
  points?

  4. Should the heatmap include gridlines or borders between cells for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the annotations and labels on
  the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or color scale indicating the range of values?

  7. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be emphasized more prominently
  on the heatmap?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout for the heatmap, such as countries along the
  y-axis and years along the x-axis, or vice versa?'
