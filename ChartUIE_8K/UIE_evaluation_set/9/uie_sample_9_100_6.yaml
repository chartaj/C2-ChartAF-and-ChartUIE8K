initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing data on the value added per
  worker in agriculture, forestry, and fishing across different countries for various
  years. Use the country names on the x-axis and the value added per worker (constant
  2015 US$) on the y-axis. Each point should represent a specific year for a country.
  This will help illustrate the differences and trends in agricultural productivity
  across countries over time. Make sure to label the axes and provide a legend to
  indicate the years or countries. This would support better analysis and understanding
  of global agricultural performance trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different years
  or countries in the legend?

  2. Would you prefer the countries to be displayed in alphabetical order on the x-axis,
  or sorted by another metric?

  3. Should the scatter plot include data point markers or symbols for each year or
  country?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size of the axis
  labels and legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in
  which style?

  6. Are there any specific countries or years you would like to highlight in the
  visualization?

  7. Would you prefer a log scale for the y-axis to better visualize differences in
  large ranges of value-added per worker?'
