initial_prompt: '<start of user instructions>

  Create a bubble chart visualizing the value added per worker in agriculture, forestry,
  and fishing across different countries. Use the "country" on the x-axis, "Year"
  on the y-axis, and size the bubbles by "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value
  added per worker (constant 2015 US$)". Each bubble should be colored uniquely by
  "Codes" to distinguish different countries. Include text annotations to highlight
  outliers or trends. This will help visualize agricultural productivity and enable
  a comparative analysis over time.

questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for distinguishing
  different countries by "Codes"?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding of the bubbles?

  3. Do you have a preference for the format or placement of the text annotations
  highlighting outliers or trends?

  4. Is there a specific range or scale you would like to use for the bubble sizes
  to represent "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added per worker (constant
  2015 US$)"?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the appearance and format of the x-axis and y-axis
  labels (e.g., font size, font type, rotation)?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines or any other specific background elements
  to enhance readability?

  7. Would you prefer the chart to have a title or subtitle, and if so, do you have

answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include a legend.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the format or placement of the text annotations.

  4. I am not sure about the specific range or scale for the bubble sizes.

  5. I do not have any specific preferences for the appearance and format of the x-axis
  and y-axis labels.

  6. Grid lines would be helpful to enhance readability.

  7. Yes, the chart should include a title. Something like "Agricultural Productivity
  per Worker Over Time Across Different Countries" would be good.'
