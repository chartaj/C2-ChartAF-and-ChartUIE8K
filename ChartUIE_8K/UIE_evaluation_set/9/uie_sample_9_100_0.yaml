initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map displaying the value added per worker in agriculture,
  forestry, and fishing across different countries from 1991. Highlight the countries
  with the highest and lowest values to emphasize disparities. Use text annotations
  to display the top 5 and bottom 5 performing countries' values. This visualization
  aims to provide a clear overview of agricultural productivity by country, helping
  identify regions with high and low efficiency. It's practical for analysts needing
  to quickly assess global agricultural productivity trends and disparities in crop
  yields and related economic activities.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?\n2. Should\
  \ the color scale be sequential or diverging?\n3. Do you want to include a legend\
  \ to explain the color scale?\n4. How would you like the highlighted countries (top\
  \ 5 and bottom 5) to be indicated? \n5. Do you have any preference for the placement\
  \ of text annotations?\n6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer\
  \ for the text annotations?\n7. Should the map include country names or codes for\
  \ reference?\n8. Would you like to display any additional contextual information\
  \ on the map?\n9. Are there any specific geographic projections you prefer for the\
  \ map?\n10. Should the title and labels be styled in a particular way?"
