initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the variation of features V1 to V24 for
  different samples from the Wall Following Robot Navigation Dataset. Highlight key
  deviations and annotate points where Class differs, focusing on V4 and V9.
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting key deviations?\n\
  2. Do you have a specific preference for line styles or markers to distinguish different\
  \ features (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.)?\n3. Should the x-axis represent the 'id'\
  \ of the samples? \n4. How would you like to see the y-axis scaled (linear, logarithmic)?\n\
  5. Do you have any specific preferences for annotations on points where Class differs\
  \ (text labels, arrows, etc.)?\n6. Are there any additional features you would like\
  \ to be focused on, besides V4 and V9?\n7. What level of grid detail do you prefer\
  \ (none, minor only, major only, both)?\n8. Would you like a legend to differentiate\
  \ features V1 to V24? \n9. Should we include titles and labels for the axes? If\
  \ so, do you have any specific wording preferences?\n10. Is there any specific format\
  \ or style you'd like for the data point labels or tooltips?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the x-axis should represent the ''id'' of the samples.

  4. Linear scale would be fine.

  5. Text labels would be good for annotations on points where Class differs.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Both minor and major grid details would be preferable.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate features V1 to V24.

  9. Yes, include titles and labels for the axes. For the title, something like "Variation
  of Features V1 to V24 in Wall Following Robot Navigation". For the x-axis, "Sample
  ID" and for the y-axis, "Feature Values".

  10. I have no specific preference.'
