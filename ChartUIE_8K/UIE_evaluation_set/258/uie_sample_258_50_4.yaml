initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the "Wall Following Robot Navigation
  Dataset" showcasing the distribution of V1 to V24 variables with respect to the
  "Class" attribute. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the violin plot?

  2. Would you like to include individual data points (jittered) on the violin plot?

  3. How would you prefer the axes to be labeled or formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  4. Should we display the mean or median within each violin?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the plot?

  6. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like on the plot?

  7. How should the violins be ordered on the plot (e.g., based on the median, mean,
  or a specific order)?

  8. Do you prefer any specific scale for the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Would you like to adjust the width of the violins to represent the number of
  observations in each class?

  10. Should we include a legend on the plot? If so, where would you prefer it to
  be placed?'
