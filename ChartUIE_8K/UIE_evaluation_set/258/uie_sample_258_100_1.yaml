initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the Wall Following Robot Navigation
  Dataset, highlighting the distribution of different variables (V1 to V24) for each
  class. Use text annotations to display key statistics like median, quartiles, and
  outliers for each variable. This will help identify variations and anomalies in
  the robot's navigation parameters. Ensure that changes in color emphasize important
  elements or differences between classes. The goal is to understand how each variable
  affects robot navigation performance and to identify any potential issues in the
  dataset. Add contextual annotations for a comprehensive understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  between classes?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for highlighting important elements
  or differences between classes?

  3. How detailed would you like the text annotations to be for key statistics (e.g.,
  decimal precision)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or any other descriptive labels in the chart?

  6. Is there any specific ordering of the variables (V1 to V24) you''d prefer in
  the box chart?

  7. Are there specific contextual annotations you would like to include for a comprehensive
  understanding, such as explanations of terminology or additional background information?

  8. Do you have preferences regarding the layout or orientation of the box chart
  (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  9. Are there any specific tools or software you prefer for creating the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the text annotations to be detailed with up to two decimal places
  for precision.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a legend or any other descriptive labels in the chart.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No specific preference, either vertical or horizontal is fine.

  9. I do not have any specific tools or software preferences.'
