initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of sensor
  readings from the Wall Following Robot Navigation Dataset. Use columns V1 to V24
  for the segments of the violin plot, and differentiate data points based on the
  'Class' label. Highlight the distribution and spread of the sensor readings as they
  relate to the different classes. This visualization will help understand the variation
  in sensor readings for the different navigation behavior classes.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different ''Class'' labels?

  2. Would you prefer to have the violin plot displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Do you need any specific statistical annotations on the plot (e.g., median, quartiles)?

  4. Should the plot include individual data points as a scatter overlay?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales you want for the y-axis representing
  the sensor readings?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  7. Do you want to include any specific titles, subtitles, or axis labels?

  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the plot?

  9. Do you require any specific styling for the plot (e.g., font type, background
  color)?

  10. Is there any additional information you would like to include in the plot, such
  as a summary of the data statistics?'
