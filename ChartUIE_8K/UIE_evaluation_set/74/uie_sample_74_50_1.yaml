initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to compare CEI, GCI, NCSI, and DDL values
  across different countries and regions. Highlight countries with the highest and
  lowest indexes. Use annotations to spotlight significant data points, such as leading
  cybersecurity performance. Provide contextual information to interpret regional
  differences.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like specific countries or regions to be highlighted with unique colors
  or patterns?

  3. How would you prefer the annotations to be displayed (e.g., callouts, text labels)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend for each index (CEI, GCI, NCSI, DDL)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order in which the indexes are stacked within
  the bars?

  6. How would you like the contextual information on regional differences to be presented
  (e.g., separate notes, integrated within the chart)?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the annotations
  and labels?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines or background shading for easier comparison?

  9. Is there a preferred orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional data points or metrics not mentioned
  in the initial request?'
