initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to various cybersecurity indexes for different
  countries categorized by region. I need to visualize the cybersecurity index data
  over different countries using bar charts. Specifically, I am interested in a bar
  chart that compares the CEI (Cybersecurity Efficient Index), GCI (Global Cybersecurity
  Index), NCSI (National Cyber Security Index), and DDL (Digital Data Literacy) values
  for a few selected countries from each region. The chart should effectively highlight
  the differences in these indexes across the countries. Please make the chart visually
  appealing and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should each index (CEI, GCI, NCSI, DDL) have its own color, or do you prefer
  another color-coding method?

  3. How many countries from each region would you like to include in the comparison?

  4. Do you want the country names to be displayed on the x-axis or as labels on the
  bars?

  5. Should the chart have a legend to identify each index?

  6. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for easier interpretation of values?

  8. Do you prefer values to be displayed on top of each bar?

  9. Should there be any specific styling or formatting for the axis labels?

  10. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text in the chart?

  11. Would you like to highlight any specific countries or regions in the chart?

  12. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, do you have any specific
  phrasing in mind?

  13. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include to
  emphasize certain points?'

  Indexes Across Selected Countries", Subtitle: "CEI, GCI, NCSI, and DDL Values".

  13. I am not sure.'
