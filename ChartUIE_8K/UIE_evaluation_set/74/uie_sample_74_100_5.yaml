initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the data from the given CSV file to
  visualize cybersecurity indexes across different countries and regions. The key
  indexes are CEI, GCI, NCSI, and DDL. Highlight the intensity of these indexes for
  each country to easily compare cybersecurity performance across regions such as
  Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Africa. Ensure that missing values are appropriately handled
  and clearly indicated in the heatmap. The goal is to provide a visual representation
  that can quickly show which countries are leading or lagging in cybersecurity measures
  based on the provided indexes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like to indicate missing values on the heatmap?

  3. Should the intensity scale be consistent across all indexes or vary for each
  one?

  4. Do you prefer a specific arrangement for the countries or regions (e.g., alphabetical
  order, by region)?

  5. Would you like to include labels for the actual index values within the heatmap
  cells?

  6. Is there a preferred method for handling missing values (e.g., interpolation,
  a specific marker)?

  7. Do you need a legend explaining the color intensities?

  8. Should specific regions (e.g., Asia-Pacific, Europe, Africa) be highlighted or
  separated visually in the heatmap?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the heatmap dimensions or aspect ratio?

  10. Would you like to include additional annotations or markers for extreme values
  or outliers?'
