initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of the Cybersecurity
  Indexes (CEI, GCI, NCSI, DDL) for different countries and regions. Highlight significant
  outliers or clusters to emphasize cybersecurity strengths or weaknesses in various
  regions. Add text annotations to label the countries with the top three highest
  and lowest index values. This visualization aims to give a clear, comparative overview
  of cybersecurity performance globally, helping identify areas needing improvement
  or further attention in cyber defense strategies. Please ensure the chart is easy
  to read and visually appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for differentiating between regions?

  2. Do you prefer a specific layout for annotations (e.g., side, top, embedded within
  bars)?

  3. Would you like the histogram bars to be grouped or stacked by region?

  4. Do you have any font preferences or size for the text annotations?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, corporate,
  vibrant)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend or any other specific labels?

  7. Do you have any preference for the bin size or range for the histogram?

  8. Should the outliers and clusters be highlighted using specific markers or colors?

  10. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to emphasize further within
  the visualization?'
