initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart that compares the cybersecurity indexes
  (CEI, GCI, NCSI, DDL) across different countries and regions. Highlight countries
  with missing values for a more informative overview. Display detailed annotations
  only for significant countries to emphasize their cybersecurity performance. Utilize
  highlights to distinguish regions, and vary colors to represent different indexes.
  This visualization helps to quickly grasp which regions lead or lag in cybersecurity
  and identify areas requiring attention. Focus on providing clear context and drawing
  attention to key elements using annotations and visual highlights.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for representing different
  indexes?

  2. Are there particular countries you consider significant and thus need detailed
  annotations?

  3. How would you prefer the regions to be highlighted or distinguished from each
  other?

  4. Do you have a preferred method for indicating countries with missing values?

  5. Would you like specific labeling or titling conventions on axes and legends?

  6. Is there a particular order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  (e.g., alphabetically, by region)?

  7. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for annotations and labels?

  8. Should the chart include any additional contextual information, such as average
  scores or benchmarks for comparison?

  9. Do you want any specific graphical elements (like shapes or icons) to be used
  for visual highlights?

  10. Are there any constraints on the dimensions or orientation of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the United States, China, and Germany should have detailed annotations.

  3. Highlight the regions using different shades or patterns.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Please display the countries by region.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include average scores for comparison.

  9. I do not have any specific preferences.

  10. I am not sure.'
