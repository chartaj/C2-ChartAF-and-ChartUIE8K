initial_prompt: 'Can you create a histogram to visualize the number of Electronic
  Waste Recycling Facilities across different counties? Make sure to use the data
  from the "Electronic Waste Recycling Facilities List" and focus specifically on
  the "County" column. I would like to see how the facilities are distributed across
  various counties, highlighting which counties have the most and least facilities.
