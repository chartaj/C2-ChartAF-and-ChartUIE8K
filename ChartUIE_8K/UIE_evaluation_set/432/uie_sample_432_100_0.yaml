initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the IMDB ratings versus total
  votes for each episode. Add text annotations to highlight the top 5 episodes with
  the highest ratings and votes to draw attention to these standout episodes. Use
  different colors or sizes for these highlighted points to make them stand out. This
  will help users quickly identify which episodes were most well-received. The scatter
  plot should give a clear view of general voting trends across different seasons
  and episodes.
