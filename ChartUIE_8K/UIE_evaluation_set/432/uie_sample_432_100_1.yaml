initial_prompt: Generate a line chart that illustrates the IMDb ratings across episodes
  for different seasons. Highlight peak rating episodes and use data-driven text annotations
  to show their exact IMDb ratings and air dates. Focus on making comparison easy
  between seasons, showing how ratings evolved over time. Ensure each season's line
  is visually distinct. This will help analyze trends in viewer ratings episode by
  episode. The data comes from the arts-and-entertainment sector, specifically IMDb
  votes per episode.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  seasons?

  2. How would you like the peak rating episodes to be highlighted (e.g., with markers,
  different colors)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the style of text annotations used for IMDb ratings
  and air dates?

  4. Would you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for each season?

  5. How detailed should the x-axis labels be (e.g., every episode, every few episodes,
  by season)?

  6. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the text annotations and labels?'
