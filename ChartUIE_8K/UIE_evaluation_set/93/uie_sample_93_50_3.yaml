initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating the world population growth from
  1951 to 2023. Use separate lines to depict population, yearly growth percentage,
  and population density. Ensure axes are labeled appropriately, with a legend for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different lines
  representing population, yearly growth percentage, and population density?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to have grid lines to make it easier to read the values?

  3. Should there be data point markers on the lines to indicate individual data points,
  or would you prefer smooth lines without markers?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a title? If so, what should the title be?

  5. Do you have any preference for the style of the legend (e.g., position, orientation)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels,
  legend, and title?

  7. Should the y-axis for population be on the left side and the y-axis for yearly
  growth percentage and population density be on the right side, or would you prefer
  another arrangement?

  8. Would you like to include annotations for notable events or significant changes
  in the data over the years? If so, where should these annotations be placed?

  9. Do you have a preference for the range or scale of the y-axes (e.g., linear or
  logarithmic scale)?

  10. Should there be a shaded area under the lines to highlight the trends, or would
  you prefer simple lines without shading?'
