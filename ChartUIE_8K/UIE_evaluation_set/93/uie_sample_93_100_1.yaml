initial_prompt: Create a population pyramid chart visualizing global population growth
  data from 1951 to 1953. Highlight the population size and yearly growth percentages
  for these years. Annotate specific years to emphasize notable growth trends. The
  chart should also include population density to give context to population distribution
  per square kilometer. Use color coding to differentiate between each year, and provide
  a textual annotation to explain the overall growth trend. The purpose is to analyze
  how the global population has increased and how density has changed over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Are there specific years you want to be prominently annotated for emphasis?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for textual annotations and labels?

  4. Should the population density be represented as bars or another format within
  the pyramid chart?

  5. Would you like gridlines or a specific background style for the chart?

  6. How should the legend be displayed (e.g., position, format)?

  7. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and their formatting (e.g., rotation,
  size)?

  8. Would you like any specific data points highlighted apart from the notable growth
  trend annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please emphasize the years 1951, 1952, and 1953.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure, maybe bars could work.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No, the notable growth trend annotations will be enough.'
