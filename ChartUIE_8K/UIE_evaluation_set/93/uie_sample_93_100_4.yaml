initial_prompt: I have a dataset on world population growth from 1951 to 1953 with
  columns for Year, Population, Yearly Growth %, Number, and Density (Pop/km2). I
  would like to create a column chart that visualizes the yearly population growth
  percentage over the years. The x-axis should represent the years, and the y-axis
  should show the yearly growth percentage. This will help to easily compare the changes
  in yearly growth during these years. Please format the y-axis in percentage to match
  the dataset. Make sure to use different colors for each year to make the chart visually
  appealing and easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each year in the column
  chart?

  2. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you prefer any particular title for the chart?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there any specific positioning you prefer for the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  6. Would you like to add data labels to each column to show the exact percentages?

  7. Do you have a preference for the width of the columns?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart for highlighting
  specific data points or trends?

  9. Do you prefer a specific background color or theme for the chart to enhance its
  visual appeal?

  10. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or should it be auto-scaled based
  on the data?'
