initial_prompt: I have a CSV file that tracks the number of babies given specific
  names from 1880 to 2020. The relevant columns include names like Amanda, Ashley,
  Betty, etc., with corresponding frequencies for each year. I need a heatmap representation
  to visualize the popularity trends over time for each name in the dataset. The x-axis
  should represent the years, while the y-axis lists the names. The color intensity
  within the heatmap should reflect the number of babies given each name in each specific
  year. Please ensure the axis labels are clear and add a color bar legend to aid
  in understanding the data distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to use a sequential, diverging, or qualitative color
  palette?

  3. Do you want to include grid lines in the heatmap for easier reading?

  4. How would you prefer the color bar legend to be positioned (e.g., right, bottom)?

  5. What font style and size would you like for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the formatting of the year labels on
  the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to display the exact frequency values within the heatmap cells?

  8. Do you have any preference for the range of color intensity used to represent
  the frequency values?

  9. Is there any specific template or style guide that you would like to follow for
  the overall appearance of the heatmap?'
