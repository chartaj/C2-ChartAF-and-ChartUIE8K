initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the baby name data, plotting each name (Amanda,
  Ashley, Betty, etc.) over the years from 1880 to 1882. Use text annotations to display
  specific values for key points, like the peak values for Helen and Betty. Highlight
  Amanda's growth trend and Helen’s peak using different colors to emphasize their
  importance. The chart should help visualize name popularity trends over time, useful
  for social-science students studying cultural shifts. Limit the x-axis to the years
  available and ensure the y-axis represents the number of babies.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for font style or size for the text annotations?

  2. Would you like the lines representing each name to have specific colors, or should
  they be chosen automatically for clarity?

  3. Do you have a preferred color for highlighting Amanda''s growth trend and Helen’s
  peak?

  4. Are there any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) you prefer for
  differentiating the names?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you want a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. What should be the labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Should there be a legend indicating which line corresponds to which name?

  9. Do you prefer any particular format for the numerical values on the y-axis (e.g.,
  commas for thousands)?

  10. Would you like to include any descriptive text or footnotes on the chart for
  additional context?'
