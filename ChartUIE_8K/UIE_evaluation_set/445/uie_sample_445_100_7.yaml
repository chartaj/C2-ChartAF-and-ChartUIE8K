initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap using the Dubois Challenge tweets
  dataset. Highlight the tweet density based on location data (lat, long). Show areas
  with higher tweet activity in warmer colors. Include additional layers indicating
  retweet counts and like counts as gradients or markers. Ensure it's interactive,
  allowing zooming into specific locations like New York, where there seems to be
  a concentration of data points. Display data labels like username and tweet content
  when hovering over any specific point. Make the map easy to understand and visually
  appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap, especially
  for representing higher tweet densities?

  2. How would you like the retweet and like counts to be visually differentiated
  on the map (e.g., specific marker shapes, sizes, or gradient colors)?

  3. Are there any particular map themes or styles you prefer (e.g., satellite view,
  street view, dark mode)?

  4. What level of zoom granularity would you like to be the default when the map
  is first loaded?

  5. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for data labels such as usernames
  and tweet contents?'
