initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the Dubois Challenge
  tweets data. Use the various counts (retweet_count, like_count, and quote_count)
  as the stacked components of each bar, with the 'datetime' as the x-axis representing
  each tweet's timestamp. Ensure different colors for the components for clarity.
  Make sure to label the axes and provide a legend. The chart should help in understanding
  the engagement trends over the timeline of the tweets, highlighting which tweets
  had the most interaction. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different components
  (retweet_count, like_count, quote_count)?

  2. What is the preferred date and time format for the x-axis labels?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., modern, classic)?

  4. Is there a specific font or font size you would like for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Should the data points on the x-axis be evenly spaced, or should they reflect
  the actual time intervals between tweets?

  6. Do you want any additional annotations or markers on the chart to highlight specific
  tweets or events?'
