initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot using the Dubois Challenge tweets data.
  Plot the ''datetime'' on the x-axis and ''like_count'' on the y-axis. Use different
  colors to distinguish between ''retweet_count'' values. Also, include tooltips to
  show ''content'' when hovering over the data points. This will help visualize tweet
  engagement over time and understand the correlation between time and likes for tweets
  participating in the #DuBoisChallenge.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different ''retweet_count''
  values?

  2. Would you like any specific markers or shapes for the data points?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the x-axis ''datetime'' be displayed with a specific date format (e.g.,
  "YYYY-MM-DD", "MM/DD/YYYY")?

  5. Do you need gridlines on the plot? If so, do you have preferences for their style
  or color?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing ''retweet_count''
  values? If yes, where should it be positioned?

  7. Do you have a preference for the title of the scatter plot? If yes, please specify
  the title.

  8. Should the tooltips display any additional information besides ''content'' (e.g.,
  ''datetime'', ''like_count'', ''retweet_count'')?

  9. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the scatter plot?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis scales (e.g., logarithmic
  scale, specific range limits)?'
