initial_prompt: Visualize tweet activity of the Dubois challenge participants with
  a dot plot. X-axis shows tweet timestamps (datetime), Y-axis displays usernames.
  Each dot corresponds to a tweet, sized by retweet_count and colored by like_count.
  Use highlights to emphasize tweets with high engagement (likes and retweets). Include
  text annotations for tweets with the highest retweet and like counts to draw attention.
  This will help understand user engagement patterns and key influential tweets. Highlight
  verified users differently to distinguish them. This analysis is practical for tracking
  campaign effectiveness and influential contributors.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the dot plot?

  2. Should the size of the dots have a specific range or scaling method for retweet_count?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style or shape for highlighting tweets with high engagement?

  4. Is there a preferred font size or style for text annotations?

  5. Should verified users be highlighted with a specific symbol or color?

  6. Are there any specific time intervals or ranges you want to focus on for the
  X-axis (tweet timestamps)?

  7. Do you prefer any particular way of sorting or ordering the usernames on the
  Y-axis?

  8. Is there a maximum or minimum threshold for retweets and likes that defines "high
  engagement" for the highlights?

  9. Do you have a preference for the background color or grid style of the plot?

  10. Should there be a legend or key to explain the sizes and colors of the dots?'
