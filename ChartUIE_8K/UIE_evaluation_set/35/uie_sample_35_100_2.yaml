initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the 'Attrition_Flag' against 'Customer_Age'
  and 'Income_Category'. Use text annotations to highlight the key values, drawing
  attention to the distribution of different age groups across income categories.
  Emphasize the attrition status with highlights, modifying the appearance (e.g.,
  color) of bars to distinguish between 'Existing Customer' and 'Attrited Customer'.
  This visualization will help analyze the relationship between customer retention,
  age, and income category, which is crucial for understanding the business dynamics
  of credit card customers and targeting retention strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''Existing Customer'' and ''Attrited Customer''?

  2. Do you want to include a legend to explain the colors used for different attrition
  statuses?

  3. Should the age groups be categorized into specific intervals, such as 10-year
  increments, or should each unique age be represented individually?

  4. Is there a preferred way you would like the income categories to be ordered (e.g.,
  ascending, descending, custom-specific order)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the text annotations, such as font size,
  color, or position?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in what
  style?

  7. Should there be any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  8. Do you want to include any additional context or descriptions in the chart title
  or subtitle?'
