initial_prompt: I want a line chart that visualizes the trend of the Total_Trans_Amt
  over time (Months_on_book) for customers categorized by Income_Category. Additionally,
  include different lines to show the variation by Gender to see if there's any noticeable
  difference in transaction amounts between males and females over the same period.
  This will help in analyzing customer behavior across different income brackets and
  genders over their relationship duration with the bank.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different Income_Category
  lines?

  2. Should different Genders be represented by different line styles or colors?

  3. Do you want data points to be marked on the lines, or just the lines themselves?

  4. Would you prefer a specific type of line smoothing (e.g., straight lines, spline)?

  5. Should the x-axis (Months_on_book) be uniformly scaled, or would you like any
  specific intervals?

  6. Do you need any specific labels or annotations on the chart to highlight key
  points?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want set for the y-axis (Total_Trans_Amt)?

  8. Would you like a legend to be displayed, and if so, do you have a preference
  for its location on the chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the background style (e.g., gridlines, backgrounds)?

  10. Should any data labels or values be displayed directly on the chart lines?'
