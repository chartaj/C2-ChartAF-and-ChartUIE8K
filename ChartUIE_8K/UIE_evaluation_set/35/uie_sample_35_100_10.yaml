initial_prompt: I want a heatmap showing the relationship between different features
  of credit card customers. Specifically, visualize customer age, income category,
  and their average utilization ratio. Also, include how dependent count and education
  level correlate with credit limits and total transaction amounts. The intent is
  to understand patterns that may influence customer behavior and attrition. Use color
  gradients to clearly represent high and low values, helping us easily identify trends
  and outliers in the data. This will be useful for our business to tailor better
  services for our clients.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to normalize the data before visualizing it?

  3. What scale type do you prefer for the heatmap (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  4. Would you like the data to be clustered or sorted in any specific way?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the heatmap''s layout (e.g., square cells, rectangular
  cells)?

  6. Should the heatmap include labels for the axes and individual cells?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  8. Would you like any specific annotations to be added to the heatmap for certain
  data points?

  9. Are there any specific ranges for the color gradients you''d prefer to highlight
  high and low values?

  10. What level of granularity or aggregation do you expect for the data attributes?'
