initial_prompt: I'd like to see a bubble chart visualizing the behavior of credit
  card customers. For the bubbles, use 'Income_Category' and 'Card_Category' combinations.
  The bubble size should represent 'Credit_Limit'. On the X-axis, plot ‘Total_Trans_Amt’
  and on the Y-axis, plot ‘Avg_Utilization_Ratio’. Utilize colors to differentiate
  between 'Attrition_Flag'. This will help us understand how different customer segments
  behave in terms of transaction amounts and credit utilization, with a focus on their
  income category and card type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to differentiate between
  ''Attrition_Flag'' categories?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or scaling of the X-axis (''Total_Trans_Amt'')
  and Y-axis (''Avg_Utilization_Ratio'')?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability or keep
  it minimalistic?

  4. Should the chart include data labels on the bubbles, such as ''Income_Category''
  and ''Card_Category'' combinations, or just use tooltips on hover?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like to set any specific margins or spacing between the chart elements?

  7. Is there a need for a legend explaining the colors and bubble sizes, or will
  the chart be self-explanatory?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette for ''Attrition_Flag'', so I’ll
  leave it to your discretion.

  2. I do not have any specific preferences for the range or scaling of the X-axis
  and Y-axis.

  3. I am not sure about gridlines, let''s go with what you think looks best.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for data labels on the bubbles; tooltips
  on hover sound good.

  5. I do not know, so please choose a professional looking font style and size.

  6. I am not sure about specific margins or spacing between the chart elements.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the colors and bubble sizes.'
