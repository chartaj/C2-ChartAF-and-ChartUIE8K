initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing TV shows on Netflix, Prime Video,
  Hulu, and Disney+. The x-axis will represent the IMDb ratings, while the y-axis
  will show Rotten Tomatoes scores. Include text annotations for shows with the highest
  IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores to highlight standout content. Use color to differentiate
  between streaming platforms, enhancing the contrast between different services.
  The purpose is to help viewers quickly identify top-rated shows and see which platform
  offers them. This visualization will be useful for audience members deciding on
  streaming services based on top-rated TV content.
