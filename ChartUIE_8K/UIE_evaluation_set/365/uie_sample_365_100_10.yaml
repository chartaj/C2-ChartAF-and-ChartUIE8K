initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the availability of TV shows
  across Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. Use the 'Title' column for the X-axis
  and the streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+) for the Y-axis
  values. Each bar should represent a TV show, stacked to show which platforms the
  show is available on (1 for available, 0 for not available). Make sure to use different
  colors to represent each streaming platform distinctly. This will help in comparing
  the distribution of TV shows across these platforms conveniently.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing the different
  streaming platforms?

  2. Are there any specific labels you would like on the X-axis (for TV show titles)
  if the number of titles is large?

  3. Do you want the chart to include a legend to differentiate the streaming platforms?

  4. Should any tooltips or hover text be included to show more details when hovering
  over a bar?

  5. Do you want the bar chart to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the TV shows to be displayed
  on the X-axis (alphabetical, by release year, etc.)?

  7. Would you like any additional grid lines or reference lines for better readability?

  8. Should the availability values (1 for available, 0 for not available) be displayed
  on the bars or only indicated by the color stack?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to the
  chart?

  10. Is there a specific chart title or subtitle you would prefer?'
