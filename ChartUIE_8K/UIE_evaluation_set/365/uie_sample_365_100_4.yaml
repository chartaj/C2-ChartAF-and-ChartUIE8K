initial_prompt: Please provide a histogram that visualizes the distribution of TV
  shows across different years (Year column) present in the dataset. The x-axis should
  represent different years, while the y-axis should indicate the frequency of TV
  shows released in each year. Also, distinguish the bars by the 'Age' category using
  different colors to show the age rating distribution over the years. This will help
  in understanding the trend of TV shows' releases over time and their corresponding
  age ratings. Additionally, highlight or annotate the year(s) with the highest number
  of releases.

  ''Age'' categories?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style for the labels and annotations?

  4. Should the bars be displayed with borders or without borders?

  5. Do you have any preference for the orientation of the labels on the x-axis (e.g.,
  angled, horizontal, vertical)?

  6. Would you like a legend to explain the different colors used for the ''Age''
  categories?

  7. Do you prefer the histogram to have a specific title or subtitle?

  8. How would you prefer the year(s) with the highest number of releases to be highlighted

  data?'
