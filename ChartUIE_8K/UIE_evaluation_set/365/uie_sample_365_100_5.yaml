initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart that shows the distribution of TV shows
  available on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. The x-axis should represent
  different streaming platforms, and the y-axis should show the count of TV shows.
  Each bar group should be divided based on the 'Age' rating categories. The chart
  should help understand which platform has more shows for different age groups like
  '18+', '16+' etc. Utilize the sample data provided (Titles, Platforms, and Age).
  Please ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret.
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for each streaming platform in the grouped
  bar chart?

  2. Should the age categories have distinct colors or patterns within each bar group?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  5. Should the counts of TV shows be displayed on top of each bar for better clarity?

  6. Do you want a legend included to clearly indicate which color or pattern corresponds
  to which age category?

  7. Would you like a title and axis labels included on the chart? If yes, do you
  have specific wording in mind?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text in the chart (e.g.,
  axis labels, title, legend)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  4. Horizontal orientation for the x-axis labels would be fine.

  5. Yes, please display the counts of TV shows on top of each bar.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to indicate which color or pattern corresponds to
  which age category.

  7. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. For the title, you could use "Distribution
  of TV Shows by Age Rating Across Streaming Platforms." X-axis label can be "Streaming
  Platforms" and Y-axis label can be "Count of TV Shows."

  8. I am not sure.'
