initial_prompt: I want to visualize the distribution of TV shows available on different
  streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). Please create a pie chart
  that shows what percentage of TV shows are available on each platform using the
  data provided. Include labels and percentages on the chart for clarity, and ensure
  the colors are distinct for each platform. This will help me understand the platform
  distribution better. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each streaming platform
  in the pie chart?

  2. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and percentages
  on the chart?

  3. Do you want any particular formatting for the percentages (e.g., decimal places,
  rounding)?

  4. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the chart to follow (e.g.,
  modern, classic, minimalist)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, or do you prefer the labels directly on the
  pie slices?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions you would like the pie chart to be (e.g., width
  and height)?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or notes on the chart to provide more
  context?'
