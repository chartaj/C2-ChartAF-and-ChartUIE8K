initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the availability of TV shows across
  different streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). Each dot represents
  a show, categorized by its availability on the four platforms. Use the "Year" column
  for the x-axis to show the release year and the "IMDb" rating for the y-axis. Differentiate
  each streaming platform with unique colors. Additionally, include the "Age" rating
  as a secondary marker to show the suitability of the content for various age groups.
  This will help understand the distribution and popularity of shows across the streaming
  services over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  differentiate the streaming platforms?

  2. Would you like the dots to have varying sizes based on the "IMDb" rating or remain
  uniform?

  3. How would you prefer the "Age" rating to be visually represented as a secondary
  marker (e.g., using different shapes, labels, or marker sizes)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and title of the chart?

  5. Should the "IMDb" ratings be displayed in a specific format on the y-axis (e.g.,
  9.4, 9.4/10)?

  6. Would you like to include legends or any form of annotations to enhance the clarity
  of the dot plot?

  7. Do you prefer any specific range or intervals for the x-axis (release year) and
  y-axis (IMDb rating)?'
