initial_prompt: '<start of user instruction>

  I want to visualize the monthly trends in Weekly Sales from the Walmart Sales data.
  Can you create a bar chart that shows the total Weekly Sales for each month? I''d
  like to see the months on the x-axis and the total Weekly Sales on the y-axis. Maybe
  use different colors or patterns for bars representing holiday weeks. Thanks!

  <end of user instruction>'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the bars representing
  holiday and non-holiday weeks?

  2. Would you prefer any specific patterns or textures for the bars representing
  holiday weeks?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each bar showing the total Weekly Sales values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the typeface and size of the labels and axis titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish holiday weeks from non-holiday
  weeks?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the months to be displayed on the x-axis
  (e.g., full month names or abbreviations)?

  7. Should the y-axis display units in a particular format (e.g., in thousands, millions,
  with currency symbols)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include in
  the chart (e.g., specific high-sales periods, notable events)?'
