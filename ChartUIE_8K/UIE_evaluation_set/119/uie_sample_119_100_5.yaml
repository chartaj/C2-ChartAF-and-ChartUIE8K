initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Walmart sales which includes Store number, Date,
  Weekly Sales, Holiday Flag, Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment. I'd
  like to visualize the correlation between these variables using a heatmap. The heatmap
  should help me understand how these factors influence weekly sales and if there
  are any patterns or significant relationships among the variables, especially during
  holidays. Provide a detailed, easy-to-understand heatmap showcasing correlations
  clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include labels for the correlation values within each cell?

  3. Would you prefer the heatmap to have a particular range for correlation values
  (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  4. Are there specific variables you want to highlight or emphasize in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like a title or specific annotations for the heatmap?

  6. Should we include grid lines in the heatmap for better differentiation of cells?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color gradient?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text within the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, include labels for the correlation values within each cell.

  3. Yes, please use the range -1 to 1 for correlation values.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a title like "Correlation Heatmap of Walmart Sales Dataset".

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color gradient.

  9. I do not know.'
