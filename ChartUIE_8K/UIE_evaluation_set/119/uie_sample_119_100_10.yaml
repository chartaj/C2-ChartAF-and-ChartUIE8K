initial_prompt: I need a dot plot for a Walmart sales analysis. The x-axis should
  represent the Date and the y-axis should represent the Weekly Sales. Each dot on
  the plot should represent a specific date and its corresponding weekly sales. Use
  different colors or shapes to indicate whether the week had a holiday (Holiday_Flag).
  Include Temperature and Fuel Price as additional dimensions in the plot, perhaps
  through color intensity or size of the dots. The overall aim is to visualize sales
  trends over time, especially distinguishing holidays and non-holidays.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the plot, especially for
  distinguishing holiday and non-holiday weeks?

  2. Would you like to customize the dot shapes beyond the default circle, perhaps
  using different shapes for holidays and non-holidays?

  3. How should the temperature and fuel price be represented on the dots? Would you
  prefer color intensity, size, or both?

  4. Is there a specific date format you would like to be displayed on the x-axis
  labels?

  5. Are there any specific holidays or notable dates that you want to highlight on
  the plot?

  6. Do you prefer additional grid lines or reference lines on the chart for better
  readability of trends?

  7. Would you like to add any annotations or labels for specific data points on the
  chart? If so, what information should be included in these labels?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specific scale or range, or should it be automatically
  determined based on the data?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme, as long as
  holidays and non-holidays are distinguishable.

  2. I am not sure about customizing dot shapes; circles should be fine.

  3. I would prefer both color intensity and size to represent temperature and fuel
  price, respectively.

  4. I don''t have a specific date format in mind.

  5. I do not know of any specific holidays or notable dates to highlight.

  6. I am not sure about this.

  7. I do not have a preference for annotations or labels for specific data points.

  8. The y-axis scale should be automatically determined based on the data.'
