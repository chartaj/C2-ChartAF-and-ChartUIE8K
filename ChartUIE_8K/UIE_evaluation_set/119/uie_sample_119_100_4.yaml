initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart that visualizes weekly sales over time for each
  store. Each line should represent a different store, showing how sales trends change
  over the given dates. Please include markers for holiday weeks and annotate with
  the unemployment rate. The x-axis should represent the date, and the y-axis should
  be the weekly sales figures. Additionally, consider including a secondary axis for
  fuel price. This will help us understand if there's a correlation between fuel prices,
  unemployment, and sales. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different stores?

  2. How would you like the holiday markers to be represented (e.g., specific symbols
  or colors)?

  3. What specific annotation style do you prefer for the unemployment rate (e.g.,
  text labels, tooltips)?

  4. Do you have a preferred format for the secondary y-axis (e.g., scaling, positioning)?

  5. Would you like gridlines for both y-axes, and if so, how should they be styled?

  6. Do you prefer any specific line styles or markers for the data points?

  7. How should the legend be displayed (e.g., position, format)?

  8. Are there any specific date formats you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  9. Would you like any specific emphasis on certain data points (e.g., peak sales
  weeks)?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title or axis labels?'
