initial_prompt: Create a histogram that visualizes the Weekly_Sales from the Walmart
  Sales data. The purpose is to understand the distribution of weekly sales across
  different stores and dates. Include text annotations for peaks in sales to highlight
  important values. Utilize highlights to differentiate between normal and holiday

  any patterns or anomalies in sales, which is crucial for business insights and decision-making.
  Aim for a clear, informative chart that emphasizes key data points and trends.
