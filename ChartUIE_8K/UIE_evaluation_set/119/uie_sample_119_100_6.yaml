initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the Walmart Sales data. Use the "Weekly_Sales"
  on the y-axis and the "Temperature" on the x-axis to visualize the relationship
  between these variables. Differentiate data points with a unique color based on
  the "Holiday_Flag" status to see if holidays have any impact on the sales-temperature
  relationship. Ensure the chart is clear, with labeled axes, a legend to distinguish
  holiday and non-holiday data points, and include grid lines for better readability.
  This will help in analyzing how temperature affects weekly sales during holiday
  and non-holiday periods.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the data points based
  on the "Holiday_Flag" status?

  2. What title would you like to give to the scatter plot?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  4. Do you want to include any specific annotations or markers for certain data points?

  5. Should the y-axis (Weekly_Sales) or x-axis (Temperature) be set to a specific
  scale (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  6. Would you like to include a trend line or fit line in the scatter plot? If yes,
  which type (linear, polynomial)?

  7. Is there a preferred position for the legend on the chart?

  8. Should we apply any custom grid line styles or intervals?

  9. Do you prefer any specific padding or margins around the chart elements?'
