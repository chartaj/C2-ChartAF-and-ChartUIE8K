initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart for Walmart Sales data. I want
  to visualize the comparison between Weekly Sales, Temperature, and Fuel Price over
  different dates, broken down by Store. Ensure each stack represents a separate Store
  ID, showing the contribution of Weekly Sales, Temperature, and Fuel Price. Highlight
  holiday weeks for better understanding. This should help in identifying any trends
  or correlations between sales, weather, and fuel prices, while considering holiday
  impacts. The unique values can guide the color coding of different stacks. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different Store IDs
  in the stacked column chart?

  2. How would you like the holiday weeks to be highlighted in the chart (e.g., with
  a different color, markers, or shading)?

  3. Would you prefer any specific ordering for the data stacks on each column (e.g.,
  Weekly Sales at the bottom, Temperature in the middle, Fuel Price at the top)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the date formatting on the x-axis?

  5. What level of granularity would you like for the x-axis (e.g., daily, weekly,
  or monthly intervals)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to be included on the chart?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between different data attributes
  (Weekly Sales, Temperature, Fuel Price) and stores? If so, where would you like
  it positioned?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?'
