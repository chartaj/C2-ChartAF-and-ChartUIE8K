initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the age distribution from the
  Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset. Use different colors to represent different
  countries (RU, etc.) and include data-driven annotations for the age groups with
  the highest frequency. Ensure that gender (FEMALE) is also highlighted if it impacts
  the age distribution. This visualization will help us understand the demographics
  of age and country effectively, aiding in psychological analysis. Annotate the key
  data points that attract the most attention to facilitate immediate insights into
  age trends within the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different countries?

  2. How would you like the impact of gender (FEMALE) to be highlighted in the histogram?

  3. Are there specific age group intervals you prefer for the histogram (e.g., 10-year
  intervals)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend or any specific labels for the different colors
  used?

  5. Do you have a preference for the style of annotations for the age groups with
  the highest frequency (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the histogram for easier readability?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or orientation of the histogram
  (e.g., horizontal vs vertical bars)?

  9. Are there any specific margins or padding you prefer around the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the key data points to be highlighted in a specific manner
  (e.g., bold, larger size, different color)?'
