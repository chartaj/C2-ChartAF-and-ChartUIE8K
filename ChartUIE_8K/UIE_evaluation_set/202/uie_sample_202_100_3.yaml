initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between age, gender,
  and country from the given Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset. The heatmap should
  display the intensity of the relationship between these variables, helping to identify
  any patterns or significant associations within the dataset. Ensure the data is
  labeled clearly and the axes are marked with the appropriate variables. Include
  a color bar to indicate the strength of the correlations. This will provide a clear
  and comprehensive view of how these demographic factors interrelate.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific numerical values displayed within each cell of the heatmap?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the scale or range on the color bar?

  4. Should any particular age ranges or gender categories be highlighted?

  5. Are there specific labels or annotations you would like added to the heatmap?

  6. What level of granularity do you prefer for the age attribute (e.g., specific
  ages, age ranges)?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the countries on the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  size, aspect ratio)?

  9. Would you like to include any additional descriptive statistics or summary information
  alongside the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, displaying specific numerical values would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. No, I have no specific preference for highlighting particular age ranges or gender
  categories.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Age ranges would be preferred.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No specific preference for layout or orientation.

  9. No, additional descriptive statistics are not necessary.'
