initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of gender
  and age within the Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset. I want the x-axis to represent
  the gender categories (FEMALE, MALE) and the y-axis to show the count of individuals.
  Additionally, I would like the bars to be color-coded based on age groups (e.g.,
  20-29, 30-39, and 40-49). This way, we can easily see how different age groups are
  distributed across genders in this psychology dataset. The chart should help us
  understand demographic patterns in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used for
  the age groups?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be segmented (e.g., 10-year intervals, custom
  intervals)?

  3. Is there a particular order you would like the gender categories to appear on
  the x-axis?

  4. Would you like to include data labels showing the count of individuals on the
  bars?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style or formatting for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish the age groups, and if so, where
  would you like it to be positioned?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for text elements in the
  chart (e.g., title, labels)?

  8. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, do you have a specific
  title in mind?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  in the chart?

  10. Would you prefer specific gridline settings (e.g., major/minor gridlines) on
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. 10-year intervals, like 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49, would be fine.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include data labels showing the count of individuals on the bars.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the style or formatting of the axis labels
  and titles.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to distinguish the age groups, positioned to the
  right of the chart.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, a title would be great. Maybe something like "Age and Gender Distribution
  in Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset".

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
