initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing facial emotion recognition data, specifically
  focusing on psychological aspects. It includes columns for set_id, gender, age,
  and country. I need a scatter plot where each point represents an individual's data.
  The x-axis should represent age, and the y-axis should represent set_id. Different
  genders should be color-coded, and data points from different countries should have
  different marker styles. This visualization will help in understanding the demographic
  distribution and the variability in the set data. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  genders?

  2. Which specific marker styles would you like to use to differentiate data points
  from different countries?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis scales (linear, logarithmic,
  etc.)?

  4. Would you prefer labels on the axes? If so, what labels would you like to use
  for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the plot? If so, should they be for both axes or just
  one?

  6. Do you require a legend to explain the color-coding and marker styles? If yes,
  where would you like it positioned on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific ranges for the axes that you would like to set (e.g.,
  age range from 20 to 60)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers?

  9. Would you like to include any additional annotations or highlights on the chart?

  10. Is there a specific title you would like to give to this scatter plot?'

  "Set ID".

  5. Yes, I would prefer gridlines on both axes.
