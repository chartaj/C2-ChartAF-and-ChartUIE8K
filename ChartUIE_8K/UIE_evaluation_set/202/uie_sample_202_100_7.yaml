initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart for the Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset.
  The x-axis should represent the 'set_id' ranging from 0 to 19, and the y-axis should
  show 'age'. Each spline line should represent different 'countries' (RU, etc.) and
  use different colors for 'gender' (male, female). This chart should help us visualize
  the age distribution for different genders and countries. It is important to differentiate
  between the lines and use legends. Dataset spans over ages 20 to 60. Missing values
  are zero.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  genders?

  2. Would you like specific markers or line styles for each country to enhance differentiation?

  3. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  5. Do you require gridlines on the chart for better readability of the data?

  6. Would you like to include data labels for each point on the spline?

  7. Is there a particular title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you want on specific data
  points or ranges?'
