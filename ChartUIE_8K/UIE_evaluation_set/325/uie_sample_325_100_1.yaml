initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart visualizing the stock data for Quantum
  Computing Inc. (QUBT). The x-axis should show dates, and the y-axis should display
  stock values like open, high, low, and close prices. Each column can stack these
  values to compare their parts visually. Highlight significant price changes or trends
  over time with different colors. Add annotations for dates with notable events or
  significant price movements to draw attention. This chart will help in understanding
  the fluctuations and trends in QUBTâ€™s stock prices over the given period.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the significant price changes
  or trends?

  2. What specific dates or events would you like annotated on the chart?

  3. How detailed do you want the annotations to be (e.g., short labels, detailed
  notes)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and annotations?

  5. Are there any other visual elements or indicators you would like to include (e.g.,
  gridlines, legends)?

  6. Is there a specific date range you want to focus on for this visualization?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the overall style and design of the chart
  (e.g., minimalist, detailed)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a preferred color scheme for significant price changes
  or trends.

  2. I would like annotated the dates when quarterly earnings were reported, major
  product launches, or significant stock price spikes/drops occurred.

  3. Short labels for the annotations would be fine.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  5. I think gridlines and a legend would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure about a specific date range.

  7. I have no specific preference regarding the overall style and design of the chart.'
