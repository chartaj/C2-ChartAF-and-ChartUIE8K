initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart to visualize voter demographics.
  Use the categories '18-29', '30-49', and '50-64' along the x-axis. For each category,
  display stacked columns showing the count of 'Vote for Clinton' and 'Vote for Trump'.
  The chart should clearly differentiate the votes counted for Clinton and Trump within
  each age group category. Make sure to include a legend identifying the different
  sections of each stack, and label the axes appropriately. This visualization will
  help us better understand the voting patterns across different age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the stacks representing
  ''Vote for Clinton'' and ''Vote for Trump''?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on top of each stack to show the vote counts?

  3. Is there a specific order in which the age groups (''18-29'', ''30-49'', ''50-64'')
  should be displayed on the x-axis, or is the default order acceptable?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  5. Should the y-axis display the vote counts as absolute numbers or percentages?

  6. Are there any gridlines or background styles you prefer for the chart?

  7. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left) on the chart?'
