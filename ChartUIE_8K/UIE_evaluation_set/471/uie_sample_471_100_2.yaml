initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing voter demographics. Use age
  groups as categories and display two bars for each, representing votes for Clinton
  and Trump. Highlight the age group with the highest votes for each candidate using
  distinct colors. Add data-driven text annotations for the exact vote counts on top
  of each bar. This chart aims to compare voting patterns across different age groups,
  making it easy to identify which age groups predominantly supported each candidate.
  Keep the layout simple for easy interpretation, focusing on clarity and direct comparison
  of voting trends by age.
