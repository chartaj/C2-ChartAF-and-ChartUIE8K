initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize student performance data using a grouped bar
  chart. The chart should compare 'Curricular units enrolled', 'Curricular units approved',
  and 'Curricular units evaluated' for both the 1st and 2nd semesters across different
  student demographics like 'Age at enrollment', 'Gender', and 'Scholarship holder'.
  Please ensure that the bars are grouped by semester and labeled with the specific
  curriculum category. Additionally, distinguish the student outcomes using different
  colors or patterns to indicate 'Target' statuses like 'Dropout' and 'Graduate'.
  This will help in identifying trends in student success and struggles.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for representing the ''Target'' statuses
  like ''Dropout'' and ''Graduate''?

  2. Do you have any preferred patterns or textures to distinguish ''Dropout'' and
  ''Graduate'' bars?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show the specific values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the demographic categories like ''Age
  at enrollment'', ''Gender'', and ''Scholarship holder''?

  5. Should the demographic groups be displayed in a specific sequence?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legends?

  7. Would you like to add any annotations or reference lines to highlight key data
  points or trends?

  8. Is there a preferred way to display the legend (e.g., at the top, bottom, or
  side of the chart)?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any supplementary information, such as average performance
  or distribution trends, in the chart?'
