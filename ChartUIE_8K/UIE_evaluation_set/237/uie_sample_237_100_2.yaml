initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the graduation and dropout
  rates across different courses. Use the "Course" as the x-axis and the count of
  "Dropout" and "Graduate" from the "Target" column as the stacked bars. Apply text
  annotations to highlight the courses with the highest dropout rates prominently.
  Additionally, include highlights to make the "Graduate" counts visibly distinct.
  This will help understand which courses have better retention and graduation rates,
  aiding in assessing course effectiveness. Include non-data-driven annotations to
  provide context on overall student performance trends.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for distinguishing between "Dropout"
  and "Graduate" in the stacked bar chart?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations highlighting
  the courses with the highest dropout rates?

  3. How would you like to represent the course names on the x-axis (e.g., full name,
  abbreviation)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  5. Would you like to include any legends or labels, and if so, where would you like
  them to be placed?

  6. Are there any specific colors or graphical styles you would prefer for highlighting
  the "Graduate" counts distinctively?

  7. How detailed should the non-data-driven annotations about overall student performance
  trends be (e.g., brief summary, detailed notes)?

  8. Would you like to include a title for the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  9. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you have any preferences for
  their appearance?

  10. Do you prefer a specific orientation for your chart (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  bars)?

  11. Are there any other stylistic preferences or design elements you''d like to
  include in the chart?'
