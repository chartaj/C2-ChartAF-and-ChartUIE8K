initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the 'Admission grade' of students.
  Annotate significant data points to highlight differences between 'Graduate' and
  'Dropout' categories. Use colors to emphasize these groups. This will help in understanding
  how admission grades correlate with student outcomes.
questions: '1. What specific colors would you like to use to represent the ''Graduate''
  and ''Dropout'' categories?

  2. How would you like the significant data points to be annotated (e.g., text labels,
  arrows)?

  3. Do you have a preferred bin size for the histogram?

  4. Do you want to include any specific titles or labels for the chart, axes, and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to set a specific range for the x-axis (Admission grade) or y-axis
  (frequency)?

  6. Are there any additional statistical annotations (e.g., mean, median) you would
  like to include on the histogram?'
