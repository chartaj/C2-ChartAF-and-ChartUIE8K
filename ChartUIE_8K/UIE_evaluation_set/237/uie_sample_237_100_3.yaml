initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the differences in the 'Admission
  grade' and 'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)' over time for students based on 'Course'.
  The x-axis should represent the 'Age at enrollment' and the y-axis should represent
  the 'Grades'. Different lines should represent different 'Courses'. Also, indicate
  the 'Target' during the timeline by using different colors or markers to highlight
  'Dropout' and 'Graduate' statuses. Add a legend and labels for clarity. This is
  for understanding how students' initial performance impacts their course completion.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for highlighting the ''Dropout''
  and ''Graduate'' statuses?

  2. Would you prefer solid or dashed lines for different ''Courses''?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the labels and
  legend?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  5. Is there a particular way you want the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  6. Should we include gridlines in the chart? If so, in both directions or just one?

  7. Would you like any annotations or additional markers for specific data points?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the thickness of the lines representing
  different ''Courses''?

  9. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific ranges or intervals?

  10. Would you like a specific background color for the chart?'
