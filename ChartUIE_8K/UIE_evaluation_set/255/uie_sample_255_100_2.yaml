initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize Bitcoin's key metrics from
  2014 to 2022. Use the annotations to highlight significant points in the 'priceUSD',
  'transactions', and 'activeaddresses' columns. The aim is to easily observe trends
  and spikes in Bitcoin's performance. Emphasize the periods with maximum values in
  price and transaction activities. Implement highlights to make these periods stand
  out. This visualization will help in understanding the growth and market behavior
  of Bitcoin over the years in cryptocurrency and blockchain industries. Ensure the
  chart is visually engaging and informative.
