initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize Bitcoin's transaction fees over time.
  Annotate standout points where transaction fees significantly increased or decreased.

  or transactions?

  4. Should the y-axis display transaction fees in a particular format (e.g., with
  a certain number of decimal places, or currency symbols)?

  5. Would you like a grid or background pattern to be included in the histogram for
  better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations and axis labels?

  7. Are there particular time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) you would
  like to segment the data into for the histogram bins?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include in the histogram?

  9. Do you want a legend or any additional text explanations on the chart?
