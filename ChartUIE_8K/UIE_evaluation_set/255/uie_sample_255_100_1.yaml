initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the Bitcoin data from April 9, 2014,
  to December 30, 2022. Highlight key trends over the years using data-driven text
  annotations on significant price changes or transaction volumes to draw the viewer's
  attention. Include annotations to explain historical market cap peaks or dips and
  note high-volume transaction days. Use highlights to distinguish between years for
  better visual clarity. This chart should help analyze long-term trends in Bitcoin's
  market behavior, useful for investors or researchers studying cryptocurrency and
  blockchain trends over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the years or
  highlights to distinguish between different years?

  2. Would you prefer the histogram bins to be aggregated by day, week, month, or
  year?

  3. Are there any specific historical events or time periods in the Bitcoin market
  that you would like highlighted with more detailed annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the placement of annotations (e.g., above peaks,
  below troughs, side of the bars)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the different color highlights and
  annotations used?

  6. Do you want to include any additional data attributes, such as ''trading volume''
  or ''active addresses'' for further context?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations and
  labels?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific ranges or scalings (e.g., logarithmic
  for price)?

  9. Are there any branding elements or logos that need to be included in the chart
  for consistency with your other materials?

  10. Would you like a trend line to be added to the histogram to show overall price
  movement over the years?'
