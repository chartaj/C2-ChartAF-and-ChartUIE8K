initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap based on the Bitcoin data from 9th-Apr-2014
  to 30th-Dec-2022. The heatmap should visualize the correlation between different
  numerical variables such as 'priceUSD', 'size', 'transactions', 'mining_profitability',
  'marketcap', 'transactionfees', 'tweets', and 'google_trends'. This will help to
  understand how these variables are interconnected. Make sure to handle any missing
  values and use an appropriate color gradient to differentiate the levels of correlation.
  The axes should be properly labeled for clarity.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used in\
  \ the heatmap?\n2. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the heatmap\
  \ to follow?\n3. Do you have any specific size requirements for the heatmap?\n4.\
  \ Would you like to include any titles or footnotes on the heatmap? If yes, please\
  \ specify.\n5. Are there any specific font types or sizes you prefer for the labels\
  \ and titles?\n6. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the correlation\
  \ values? \n7. Do you prefer a specific range of correlation values (e.g., -1 to\
  \ 1) to be highlighted in the heatmap?\n8. Would you like the heatmap to show only\
  \ significant correlations above a certain threshold?\n9. Are there any particular\
  \ annotations or markers you would like to add to the heatmap for better clarity?\n\
  10. Do you have a preference for the format of the correlation values (e.g., decimal\
  \ places) displayed on the heatmap?"
