initial_prompt: I would like a line chart visualizing Bitcoin data from 9th-Apr-2014
  to 30th-Dec-2022. The x-axis should represent the "Date," while the y-axis should
  have different lines for "priceUSD," "marketcap," "transactions," and "activeaddresses."
  Please ensure each line is a different color for clarity, and include a legend.
  Use the provided data columns for plotting. The chart should help visualize trends
  and correlations over time in the Bitcoin market. Make sure the chart is clear and
  easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color scheme for the lines on the chart?

  2. What style or type of line (solid, dashed, dotted) do you prefer for each data
  attribute?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines? If so, any specific markers
  (circle, square, triangle)?

  any preference for the gridline style?
