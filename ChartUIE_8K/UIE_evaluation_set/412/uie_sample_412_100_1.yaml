initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart illustrating how European countries generated
  electricity from 2016 to 2018, focusing on three energy types: Conventional thermal,
  Nuclear, and Hydro. Highlight the trends for Belgium by distinguishing its lines,
  perhaps using different colors or thickness. Annotate key data points for Belgium
  in each year to emphasize significant changes. Use text annotations to provide context
  and facilitate comparison among the countries. The purpose of this visualization
  is to analyze energy generation trends over these years and draw attention to noteworthy
  shifts in Belgium''s energy production.'
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for the lines representing the different
  energy types?

  2. How would you prefer Belgium''s trends to be distinguished? Do you prefer different
  colors, line thickness, or another method?

  3. Do you have a specific style or format preference for the annotations on key
  data points?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the energy types and
  countries? If yes, where would you prefer the legend to be placed?

  5. Do you have a preferred font and size for text annotations and labels?

  6. Would you like gridlines in the background of the chart? If yes, should they
  be major gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  7. Do you want the x-axis and y-axis titles to be labeled with specific text? If
  so, what should they be?

  8. Should the chart include any specific annotation or highlight for the overall
  trend comparison among countries, aside from Belgium?

  9. Do you prefer any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratio?'
