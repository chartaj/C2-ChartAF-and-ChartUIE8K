initial_prompt: Create a line chart displaying the trend in discounted prices over
  different models for each brand. Use the "brand_name" and "model_name" on the x-axis
  and "discounted_price" on the y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. How would you like the brands to be distinguished on the chart (e.g., different
  line styles, colors, or markers)?

  3. Do you want to include data labels for specific points on the lines?

  4. Should the x-axis labels rotate for better readability, given that both brand
  and model names will be displayed?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to identify the brands and models?

  6. What level of detail do you prefer for the y-axis (e.g., should it include grid
  lines, specific labeling increments)?

  7. Do you want the chart to display any specific annotations or highlights for certain
  data points or trends?

  8. Should the chart include a title and, if so, what should it be?

  9. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the chart text (axes
  labels, title, etc.)?

  10. Would you like to add a secondary y-axis for any additional data attributes,
  or should the focus remain solely on discounted prices?'
