initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the changes in "discounted_price"
  over different "ratings" for the various smartphone models. Ensure the x-axis represents
  "ratings" and the y-axis represents "discounted_price." Use different lines to distinguish
  between "brand_name" for a clear comparison. This will help identify how discounted
  prices vary with customer ratings across different smartphone brands in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between different
  brands?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) used
  for different brands?

  4. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines, such as circles or squares
  at each data point?

  5. Do you need labels or values to be displayed directly on the data points?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used for the axis labels
  and legend?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned (e.g., right, bottom, top)?

  8. Would you prefer a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you want any specific annotations or markers for highlighting key points or
  trends?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to include in
  the chart (such as a note or data source)?'
