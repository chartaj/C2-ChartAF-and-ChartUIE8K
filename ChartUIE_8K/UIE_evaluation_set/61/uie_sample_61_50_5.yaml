initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between the numeric
  features: discounted_price, original_price, rating, rom, ram, screen_size_cm, display_size_inch,
  front_camera, rear_camera (binary encoding), and battery (mAh extracted). Highlight
  strong positive and negative correlations.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display correlation coefficients as text annotations?

  3. Do you have a specific range or threshold for what constitutes ''strong'' correlations
  that you want highlighted?

  4. Should the heatmap include a color bar or legend indicating the correlation coefficient
  values?

  5. Do you have a preferred order for the features, or should they be ordered based
  on the correlation hierarchy?

  6. Is there a specific title or labels you would like included on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please display the correlation coefficients as text annotations.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include a color bar or legend indicating the correlation coefficient
  values.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.'
