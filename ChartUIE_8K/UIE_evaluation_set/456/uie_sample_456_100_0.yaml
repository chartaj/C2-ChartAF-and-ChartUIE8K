initial_prompt: I would like a line chart that visualizes the "Overall score" for
  different countries in Europe, as specified in the provided data. The x-axis should
  represent the countries, and the y-axis should show the "Overall score." Highlight
  the countries with the highest and lowest scores using different colors or markers.
  Add data-driven text annotations to emphasize these scores, and provide context
  about the food security index. Ensure the chart is easy to read and visually engaging,
  drawing attention to the key elements highlighted. The chart should help viewers
  quickly understand the overall food security status across European countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like a specific type of marker for highlighting the highest and lowest
  scores?

  on the x-axis?

  or the overall chart?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors or markers used in the
  chart?

  7. Is there any additional context or information about the food security index
  that you would like to include in the chart?'
