initial_prompt: I need a choropleth map visualization for the Global Food Security
  Index, focusing on Europe. The map should highlight different regions (NEU, WEU)
  within Europe, showcasing individual countries like Finland, Ireland, and the Netherlands
  with their respective overall scores. Make sure to color-code each country based
  on their score, so it's easy to compare food security levels across the regions.
  Analyze the missing data for regions, and handle them appropriately to ensure the
  map's accuracy. Additionally, include a legend explaining the color gradient representing
  the overall scores.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the color gradient be continuous or categorical?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for how missing data should be handled or
  indicated on the map?

  4. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the map for key countries?

  5. Do you require any specific map projection for the choropleth map?

  6. Would you like additional data points or metrics to be included in the tooltip
  or on-hover display?'
