initial_prompt: I'd like to create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of
  the "Major Area" column data. This will help to understand the proportion of the
  overall food security index across different regions. The chart should clearly label
  each slice with the respective "Major Area" and show the percentage of the total
  for each. Please ensure that the colors used for each slice are distinct and easy
  to differentiate. The goal is to represent the global food security index visually
  by highlighting the major areas contributing to it.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or a color palette you would
  like to use for the distinct slices in the pie chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels on each slice?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend in addition to the labels on each
  slice?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the slices to be arranged (e.g.,
  ascending, descending, alphabetical)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout and design of the pie chart
  (e.g., 3D effects, shadows, borders)?

  6. Would you like to include any additional text or annotations on the chart, such
  as a title or subtitle? If so, please specify.'
