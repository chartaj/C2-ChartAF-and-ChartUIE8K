initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the Meta company dataset to visualize
  the relationship between 'Date' and 'Close' prices. Ensure data points are clearly
  marked, with 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' prices on the y-axis. Make sure to
  handle the date format accurately. Additionally, include data point colors to differentiate
  the trading volumes using a color gradient. This will help in understanding how
  the trading volume impacts the closing prices over time. The chart should be interactive
  to easily hover over and see date and closing price values. Thank you!

  volumes?
