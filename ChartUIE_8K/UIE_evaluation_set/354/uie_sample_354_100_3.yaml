initial_prompt: I would like to create a heatmap to visualize the Meta company's stock
  data over time. The data includes columns such as Date, Open, High, Low, Close,
  Adj Close, and Volume. Specifically, I want to see how trading volumes fluctuate
  over different days, and how the stock's price range (highs and lows) vary over
  time. Use colors to represent different ranges of trading volumes and price variations,
  so it's easy to spot trends and outliers. Make sure the heatmap is easy to interpret,
  even for someone with a basic understanding of stock data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to represent different
  ranges of trading volumes and price variations?

  2. How would you like the color gradients to be represented? For example, do you
  prefer darker colors for higher values or lighter colors?

  3. Should the heatmap include annotations for specific values, such as the highest
  and lowest trading volumes or price ranges?

  4. Do you prefer a specific time interval for the data display, such as daily, weekly,
  or monthly?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines or separators to distinguish between different
  days or time intervals?

  6. Do you want labels on the axes to display the specific dates and price/volume
  ranges, or do you prefer a more minimalist design?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend that explains the color coding for different
  ranges of trading volumes and price variations?

  8. Do you have any preference for the orientation of the heatmap (horizontal vs.
  vertical)?

  9. Would you like any particular highlights, such as marking weekends or significant
  events on the timeline?

  10. Is there a specific style or theme you would prefer for the overall look and
  feel of the heatmap (e.g., modern, classic, etc.)?'
