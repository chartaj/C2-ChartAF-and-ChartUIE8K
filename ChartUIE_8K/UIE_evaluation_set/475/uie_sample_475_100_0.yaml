initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the distribution of immigrants
  from different regions to a particular country over the years. Use data columns
  like 'Region and country of last residence 1', 'Austria-Hungary', 'Germany', 'Ireland',
  'Italy', etc. Highlight regions with the highest immigration numbers to show trends.
  Include text annotations for key years or notable changes in the data to draw attention.
  This visualization can help government agencies understand immigration patterns,
  aiding in policy-making and resource allocation for immigrant communities.
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the choropleth map?\n\
  2. Are there any particular regions you want to emphasize or highlight distinctly?\n\
  3. What type of text annotations or labels do you prefer for indicating key years\
  \ or notable changes?\n4. Do you have a preferred range of years to focus on for\
  \ the trend analysis?\n5. Would you prefer to display the data on a world map or\
  \ a map focused on specific continents/regions?\n6. Do you have any preferred font\
  \ styles or sizes for text annotations to ensure readability?\n7. Are there any\
  \ specific immigration metrics or statistics you want to feature prominently besides\
  \ the raw numbers? \n8. How do you prefer to handle regions with zero immigration\
  \ numbers in the visual representation? \n9. Do you have any preferences for the\
  \ layout or orientation of the legend on the map?"
