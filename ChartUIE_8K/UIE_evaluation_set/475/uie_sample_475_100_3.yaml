initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize immigration data from 1825,
  1835, and 1845, showing different regions and countries of last residence. Use columns
  for each year and stack them by regions like Europe (Austria-Hungary, Germany, Ireland,
  etc.), Asia (China, India, etc.), America (Canada, Mexico, etc.), Africa, Oceania,
  and Not Specified. Highlight significant immigration trends and regional contributions
  for each year. This will help in comparing regional shifts over the years and identifying
  patterns in historical immigration data. Ensure that all values are accurately represented
  in respective stacks for each year.
