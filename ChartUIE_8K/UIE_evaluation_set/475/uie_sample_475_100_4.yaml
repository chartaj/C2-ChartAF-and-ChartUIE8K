initial_prompt: I need a histogram visualizing the immigration trends over years for
  different regions and countries of last residence. The x-axis should represent the
  "Years" from the "Region and country of last residence 1" column, and the y-axis
  should show the "Number of immigrants." Each bar in the histogram should be color-coded
  to represent different regions or countries, including "Germany," "Ireland," "Italy,"
  "Russia," "Norway and Sweden," "United Kingdom," "China," "India," "Philippines,"
  and others. The data should come from the columns listed.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different regions
  or countries in the histogram?

  2. How do you prefer to handle the "others" category that is not explicitly listed?

  3. What is your preference for the bar width and spacing between the bars?

  4. Do you want to include a legend indicating which color corresponds to which region
  or country?

  5. Are there any specific labeling requirements for the x-axis (Years) and y-axis
  (Number of immigrants)?

  6. Would you like the histogram to include grid lines for easier reading of values?

  7. Do you want the histogram to have a title, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Would you prefer the histogram to include any annotations or data labels indicating
  the exact number of immigrants for each bar?

  9. Do you have any specific font or styling preferences for the axis labels and
  titles?

  10. Are there any additional notes or contextual information you want to include
  in the chart to help interpret the data?'
