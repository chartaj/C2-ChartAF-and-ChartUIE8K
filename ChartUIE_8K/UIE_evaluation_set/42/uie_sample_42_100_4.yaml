initial_prompt: 'Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the data in ''../Extra_datas/data/42.csv''.
  This dataset contains information on "Kidney Stone Prediction based on Urine Analysis"
  with columns: gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, calc, and target. I want the chart
  to show the distribution of the target variable (0 or 1) across these parameters.
  Use different colors to represent each target category, and stack the bars accordingly
  for each parameter to display the comparisons effectively. Make sure all data points
  are represented. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing each category
  of the ''target'' variable?

  2. Would you prefer any particular order for the parameters on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want to include labels for each bar segment to represent the actual counts
  or percentages?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors used for each ''target''
  category?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines to help in comparing values across parameters?

  7. Do you want to see the values on the y-axis represented in raw counts or percentages?

  8. Would you like to add any specific title or subtitle to the chart?

  9. Should we include any annotations or additional text to highlight key insights
  from the data?

  10. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I would like to include labels for each bar segment to represent the actual
  counts.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, the chart should include gridlines.

  7. Raw counts.

  8. Title: "Distribution of Target Variable Across Parameters in Kidney Stone Prediction"

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Vertically.'
