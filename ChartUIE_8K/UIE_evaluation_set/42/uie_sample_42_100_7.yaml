initial_prompt: Create a histogram for the Kidney Stone Prediction dataset to visualize
  the distribution of 'gravity', 'ph', 'osmo', 'cond', 'urea', and 'calc'. Ensure
  each variable has its own subplot. Use different colors for each histogram to distinguish
  them clearly. The x-axis should represent the value ranges of each variable, and
  the y-axis should show the frequency of occurrences. This will help identify any
  patterns or anomalies in the urine analysis data that could be relevant for predicting
  kidney stones.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histograms?

  2. What bin width would you like to use for each histogram?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles for better clarity?

  4. Do you prefer a specific arrangement for the subplots (e.g., in rows or columns)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the histograms?

  6. Should the histograms include any summary statistics, such as mean or median,
  overlaid on the plots?

  7. Is there a specific range for the x-axis values that you would like to focus
  on for each variable?

  8. Do you prefer solid fills or transparent fills for the histograms?

  9. Should the y-axis be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  10. Do you need to include annotations for any specific data points or ranges?'
