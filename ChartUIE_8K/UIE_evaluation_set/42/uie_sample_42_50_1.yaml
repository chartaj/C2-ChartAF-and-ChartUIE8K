initial_prompt: I want a line chart visualizing the urine analysis data for predicting
  kidney stones. Highlight key data points and use text annotations to display values.
  Ensure the chart includes gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, and calc, with target classification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the chart?

  2. How would you like the key data points to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  larger size, etc.)?

  3. Where should the text annotations be placed relative to the data points?

  4. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the different
  data attributes?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the data attributes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the axis scales (linear or logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like the chart to display any gridlines for better readability?

  8. How do you prefer the "target" classification to be indicated on the chart (e.g.,
  color-coded areas, markers)?'
