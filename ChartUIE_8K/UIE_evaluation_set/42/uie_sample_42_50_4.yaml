initial_prompt: 'Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the unique values of each
  feature (columns: gravity, ph, osmo, cond, urea, calc) in the kidney stone dataset.
  Each bar should represent a feature, with stacks showing different ranges of unique
  values.'
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the stacks in the bar chart?

  2. Do you have specific ranges in mind for each feature, or should they be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  3. Should the ranges be uniform across all features or customized individually for
  each feature?

  4. Would you like data labels displaying the count of unique values within each
  range in the stacks?

  5. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the bars in the chart?

  6. Is there a specific ordering of features you would like for the bars, or should
  they follow the order from the dataset?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better visual
  separation of the stacks?

  8. Do you have any particular font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  9. Should there be any specific annotations or markers to highlight key insights
  on the chart?

  10. Do you prefer a specific chart title and axis labels for better context? If
  so, please provide them.'
