initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the given urine analysis data to visualize
  trends in 'gravity', 'ph', 'osmo', 'cond', 'urea', and 'calc' values over multiple
  samples. Highlight critical points, such as max and min values, with text annotations
  for better visibility. This will help with kidney stone prediction by showcasing
  variations and significant patterns in the data, aiding health professionals in
  identifying potential concerns at a glance. Focus the viewer's attention on key
  outliers and unusual trends. Consider color-coding the lines for clear differentiation
  between each variable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  to use for each variable line?

  2. How would you like the critical points (max and min values) to be annotated (e.g.,
  specific text format, arrow indicators)?

  3. Do you have a specific style in mind for the line types (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted)?

  4. Would you prefer a particular type of legend placement or style for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific axis labels or ranges you would like to set up for the
  chart?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart? If so, should they be
  for both axes or just one?

  7. Is there a specific font or text style you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  8. Do you have any preference for the chart title and subtitle format?

  9. Are there any secondary visual elements you want to include, such as moving averages
  or trend lines?'
