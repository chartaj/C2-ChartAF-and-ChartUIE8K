  Use annotations to show top-rated albums and artists. Emphasize countries with more

  via color intensity or numerical labels)?

  5. Are there any specific geographic regions or countries you want to emphasize
  or exclude?

  6. What level of annotation detail do you prefer for the artists (e.g., include
  album names, release dates)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map''s projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. Is there a specific layout or arrangement you prefer for the annotations to minimize
  clutter?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as genre
  or artist popularity?

  10. Should the heatmap consider album release years, and if yes, how should they
  be aggregated (e.g., by decade)?'
