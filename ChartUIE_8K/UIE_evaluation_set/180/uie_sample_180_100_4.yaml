initial_prompt: I want to create a line chart to visualize the average ratings of
  albums over time. From the "Top 5000 Albums of All Time" dataset, plot the "Release
  Date" on the x-axis and the "Average Rating" on the y-axis. This will help me see
  how the average ratings have changed across different years. Make sure to properly
  handle the date format and missing values. Use a line to connect the points for
  a clear trend analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to include markers for each data point on the line?

  3. Do you want gridlines in the background for better readability?

  4. Should the axes have specific labels or titles?

  5. What date format would you prefer to be displayed on the x-axis?

  6. Do you want to smooth the line (e.g., with a moving average) to better show the
  trend?

  7. How would you like us to handle the missing values in the data?

  8. Would you like to add any specific annotations or highlights on particular years
  or ratings?'
