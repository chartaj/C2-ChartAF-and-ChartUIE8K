initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize employee attrition based on education
  levels. Highlight the education levels with the highest attrition rates. Add text
  annotations to show the percentage of employees who left for each education level.
  The purpose of this chart is to identify if certain education fields are more prone
  to attrition. Use distinct colors to differentiate between attrition and non-attrition
  for better clarity. Include annotations to provide context about why specific education
  levels might have higher attrition rates.

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the bar chart?

  4. Should the text annotations for the percentage of employees who left be placed
  on top of the bars or inside the bars?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text annotations
  and titles?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the chart to help with value estimation?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  8. Should the chart include any specific context or notes about why certain education
  fields might have higher attrition rates?

  9. Are there any additional filters or categories you would like to see included
