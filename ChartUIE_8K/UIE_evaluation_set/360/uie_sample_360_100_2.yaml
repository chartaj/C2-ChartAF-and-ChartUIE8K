initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize employee attrition by education
  level. Use different colors to represent attrition status (Yes/No). Annotate the
  bars with the percentage of attrition within each education level to highlight key
  differences. Include a legend for clarity. The chart should help HR analyze the
  correlation between education levels and attrition rates. Emphasize the differences
  to identify any significant trends or patterns.

  to make trends more noticeable?'
