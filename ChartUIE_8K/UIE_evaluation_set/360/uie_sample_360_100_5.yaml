initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing employee attrition trends over the
  years, focusing on the impact of education levels. The x-axis should represent years
  at the company, and the y-axis should show the number of employees who left. Please
  differentiate the lines by education levels (e.g., 1 to 5). Make sure to label the
  axes clearly and include a legend for the education levels. This will help us understand
  how education influences attrition rates over time for better strategic HR planning.
  Thank you!

  different education levels?

  lines)?

  chart?
