initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the student performance data.
  The chart should display the scores of students in math, reading, and writing, broken
  down by their gender. The purpose of this visualization is to analyze the performance
  differences between male and female students and identify any notable patterns.
  Additionally, include data-driven annotations on a few data points to highlight
  exemplary or concerning scores. Finally, use highlights to differentiate between
  the scores, ensuring the colors represent the subjects clearly. This should help
  in understanding how gender might influence academic performance in different subjects.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing the subjects
  (math, reading, writing) in the stacked bar chart?

  2. What type of annotations would you like to see on the data points (e.g., numerical
  values, percentage change, labels)?

  3. How many exemplary or concerning scores would you like to highlight with annotations?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the bar chart (horizontal
  vs. vertical)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to clearly differentiate between the subjects,
  and if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned?'
answers: '<start user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Numerical values would be good.

  3. I would like to highlight around 3-5 exemplary or concerning scores.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I am not sure about the position, maybe in a
  corner?
