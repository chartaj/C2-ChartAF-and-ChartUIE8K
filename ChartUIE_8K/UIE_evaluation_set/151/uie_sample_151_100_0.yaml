initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing student performance by gender, showcasing
  average math, reading, and writing scores. Highlight differences between male and
  female students' scores to emphasize performance disparities. Annotate key data
  points to draw attention to noteworthy scores in each subject. The chart should
  help educators understand gender-related performance trends and identify areas needing
  support.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer to use to differentiate between
  male and female students'' scores?

  2. Do you have any specific font preferences for annotations and labels?

  3. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the bar chart?

  or both?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for the legend to indicate gender?

  8. Are there any specific ranges you want to highlight on the axis (e.g., score
  ranges that denote high or low performance)?

  10. Would you like any additional summary statistics to be displayed on the chart,
  such as standard deviations or percentiles?'
