initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showcasing the correlation between gender, race/ethnicity,
  parental education, lunch, test prep course, and scores in math, reading, and writing.
  Annotate key points such as highest and lowest scores to highlight performance patterns.
  Use highlights to emphasize notable trends. This will help in understanding factors
  affecting student performance in education. Ensure the visualization is clear and
  insightful for educators to identify areas needing attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the correlation values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for annotations on the heatmap?

  4. How would you like the highlights to be represented, e.g., bold outlines or different
  colors?

  5. Should the highest and lowest scores be annotated with specific labels or icons?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout of the heatmap, such as cell size
  or spacing?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines or separators between the heatmap cells?

  8. Are there any specific trends or performance patterns you are particularly interested
  in highlighting?

  9. Should the heatmap include labels for each axis, and if so, do you have a preference
  for their wording or orientation?

  10. Do you want the heatmap to have a title? If so, what should it be?'
