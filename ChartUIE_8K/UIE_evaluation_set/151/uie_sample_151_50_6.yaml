  5. Do you have a preference for the order of the axes on the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  6. Would you like any specific filtering or highlighting options (e.g., highlight
  students who completed the test preparation course)?

  7. Are there any specific comparisons you would like to emphasize within the chart?
