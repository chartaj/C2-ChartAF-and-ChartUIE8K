initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart to visualize the average scores of students
  in math, reading, and writing across different races/ethnicities. Use data from
  Student performance prediction. Group columns by race/ethnicity and have separate
  colored bars for each subject. Label the x-axis with race/ethnicity groups and the
  y-axis with average scores. Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret, showcasing
  performance comparisons among groups. Please include a legend to differentiate between
  subjects. Add a title such as "Average Student Performance by Race/Ethnicity". This
  will help in understanding educational disparities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing each
  subject?

  2. What font style or size would you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on each bar for better readability?

  be displayed on the x-axis?

  5. Is there a specific format you would prefer for the legend (e.g., position, font
  size, etc.)?

  6. Are there any specific guidelines for the height and width of the chart?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines for easier comparison of scores across different
  races/ethnicities?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the style or format of the y-axis labels
  (e.g., number formatting, intervals)?'
