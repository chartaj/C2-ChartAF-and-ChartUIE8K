initial_prompt: 'I have a student performance dataset with several categorical and
  numerical features including gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education,
  lunch type, test preparation course, and scores in math, reading, and writing. I
  need a Parallel coordinates chart to visualize this data. This should help explore
  the relationships and patterns between different features and scores among students.
  Use all the columns provided: gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education,
  lunch, test preparation course, math score, reading score, and writing score. Ensure
  each line represents a student. No missing values.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different categories
  or lines in the chart?

  2. Would you like to highlight certain categories or data points within the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order of the axes for the features in the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  4. Should the chart include axis labels and legends, and if so, any specific formatting
  for them?

  5. Would you like to apply any particular scaling methods to the numerical data
  (e.g., standardization or normalization)?

  6. Are there specific line styles or thickness preferences for better clarity in
  the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any specific plot annotations or data highlights (e.g.,
  mean values, outliers)?'
