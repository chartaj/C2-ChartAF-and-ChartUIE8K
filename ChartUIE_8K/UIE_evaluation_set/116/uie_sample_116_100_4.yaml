initial_prompt: I need a heatmap for the Coffee Taste Test dataset. The heatmap should
  visualize how different coffee attributes (like bitterness, acidity, and personal
  preference) vary by age demographics. Include different types of coffee (A, B, C,
  D) and their respective attributes on one axis. Use age groups on the other axis.
  Ensure that the color gradient clearly represents the intensity of each attribute,
  which will help identify preferences and trends. For more thorough analysis, it
  would be great if the missing values were represented distinctly or noted. This
  visualization is intended for food-and-drink insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color gradients for representing the intensity
  of attributes?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be represented in the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the age groups on the axis?

  4. Should there be any special highlighting or annotations for specific age groups
  or coffee attributes?

  5. Is there any particular labeling or formatting style you prefer for the axes
  and legends?

  6. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes that you prefer for the text within
  the heatmap?

  8. Do you need any specific threshold indicators or guidelines to identify trends?'
