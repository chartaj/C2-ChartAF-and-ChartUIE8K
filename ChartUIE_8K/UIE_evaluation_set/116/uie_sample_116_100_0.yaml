initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the "age" distribution from the Coffee
  Taste Test dataset. Use text annotations to highlight specific age groups with the
  highest and lowest participation. Add highlights to the bars of these age groups
  to emphasize their importance. The purpose is to understand the demographic range
  of participants, focusing attention on prominent and less-represented age groups.
  Include a title that reflects the importance of age demographics in coffee preferences.
  Display the number of participants on the y-axis and age groups on the x-axis. Ensure
  it's visually engaging and informative.
