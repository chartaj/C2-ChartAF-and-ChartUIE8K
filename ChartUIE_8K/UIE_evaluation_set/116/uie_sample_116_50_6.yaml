initial_prompt: Create a line chart for the Coffee Taste Test dataset. Plot age groups
  on the x-axis and the average coffee bitterness ratings for coffee types A, B, C,
  and D on the y-axis. Use different lines for each coffee type to see bitterness
  trends across different age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart lines representing
  different coffee types?

  2. Should the age groups on the x-axis be sorted in ascending order?

  based on the data range?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  coffee type?

  6. Should data points be marked with symbols on the line chart?

  7. Would you like labels or annotations for specific data points or trends?

  8. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?
