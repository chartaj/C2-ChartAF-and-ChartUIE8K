initial_prompt: I have coffee tasting survey data and I want to visualize the results
  in a stacked bar chart. Specifically, I need to compare the different coffee drinkers'
  preferences based on their age groups. The chart should show the favorite coffee
  types (e.g., Regular drip coffee, Iced coffee) across different age ranges (e.g.,
  18-24, 25-34). Each bar should represent an age group and be stacked to show the
  distribution of favorite coffee types within that group. Include labels and a legend
  for clarity.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different coffee types in the
  stacked bar chart?

  2. Do you have a specific order in which age groups should appear on the x-axis?

  3. Should the chart include data labels showing the number of respondents for each
  coffee type?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to display the percentage distribution of favorite coffee types
  within each age group in the stacks?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. No, I do not have a specific order for the age groups.

  3. Yes, the chart should include data labels showing the number of respondents for
  each coffee type.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. I am not sure.'
