initial_prompt: Create a radial bar chart to visualize the coffee preferences from
  the coffee taste test data. Highlight age groups and favorite coffee types to emphasize
  trends. Annotate key points like the most popular brewing methods and additions,
  especially the contrasts in black coffee versus sweetened coffee. Focus on making
  it easy to compare different demographics, like age groups and gender differences.

  unique preferences and spending habits. This will help us understand diverse coffee
  consumption behaviors and preferences, making the visualization informative and
  engaging.
