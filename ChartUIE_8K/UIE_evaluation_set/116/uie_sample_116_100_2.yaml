initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize coffee drinkers' preferences and
  attributes from the "Coffee Taste Test" data set. Label the axes with attributes
  like age ranges, preferred brewing methods, and favorite coffee types. Use color
  highlights to distinguish different age groups and favorite coffee styles. Add text
  annotations for key data points, such as the most popular brewing method or any
  notable trends in coffee preferences among different demographics. This will help
  in visually understanding the preferences and patterns in coffee consumption. The
  purpose is to focus on highlighting key elements to understand consumer preferences.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to highlight
  different age groups?

  2. Are there particular colors you would like to use to distinguish between favorite
  coffee styles?

  3. Should the age ranges be grouped into specific intervals, or would you prefer
  detailed age categories?

  4. How would you like the preferred brewing methods to be displayed on the chart?
  (e.g., in alphabetical order, by popularity, etc.)

  5. Are there any specific data points or trends you want text annotations to focus
  on, aside from the most popular brewing method?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend for the color highlights, or should
  the color distinctions be self-explanatory?

  7. Should the favorite coffee types be displayed on the x-axis or the y-axis?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the chart?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations
  on the chart?

  10. Would you like to add any additional filters or segmentations to break down
  the data further, such as by geographical region or coffee consumption frequency?'
