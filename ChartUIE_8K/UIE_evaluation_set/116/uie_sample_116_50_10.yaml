  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling for the axes or any additional annotations?

  4. Should the age groups be represented as continuous or categorical data on the
  x-axis?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you would like the y-axis (expertise levels)
  to be set to?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between different coffee brewing
  methods?

  7. Are there any specific gridlines or background styles you prefer for the scatter
  plot?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size of the markers in the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific data points or clusters within the scatter
  plot?'
