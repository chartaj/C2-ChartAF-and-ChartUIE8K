initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the "Title of News" and "News Channel
  Name" linkage. Use different colors to emphasize occurrences for each news channel
  and type of news. Highlight channels frequently mentioned and distinguish children-related
  news. Text annotations should be included to mark important highlights, focusing
  viewer attention on more frequent or significant events. This will help analyze
  coverage trends and channel focus in reported news. Add a legend to aid interpretation.
  This visualization will be useful for community event analysis and understanding
  news distribution patterns across different channels.
