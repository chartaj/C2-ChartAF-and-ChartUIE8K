initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the frequency of news articles
  per news channel from the Community Events Report Dataset. Use the 'News Channel
  Name' column to plot the distribution and highlight the count of articles each channel
  has reported. This will help identify which news channels are most actively reporting
  in the dataset. Make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret with clear
  axis labels and a descriptive title. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars in the histogram?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for easier interpretation?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the histogram display exact counts or percentages on the bars themselves?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the labels on the x-axis (horizontal,
  tilted, vertical)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or key, even if it''s not strictly necessary
  for a histogram?

  7. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the chart area?

  8. Should there be any annotations or extra textual information besides the axis
  labels and title?

  9. Do you want to set a specific range for the y-axis, or should it auto-adjust
  to fit the data?

  10. Would you like to highlight or emphasize any particular news channels in the
  histogram?'
