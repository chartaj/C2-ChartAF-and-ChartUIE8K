initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the number of unique news titles and descriptions
  over time, with different lines for each news channel. Highlight points where significant
  news events occurred, like a missing child, a robbery, or a fatal accident. Annotate
  these points to provide more context. This visualization will help understand trends
  in news reporting frequency by different channels and draw attention to key events.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific time range or time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly) that you prefer for the x-axis?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the different news channels?

  3. How would you like the significant news events to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, shape, or size of points)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of the annotations for significant
  news events?

  5. Should the y-axis represent the number of unique news titles, descriptions, or
  a combination of both?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., right, top, bottom,
  or left)?

answers: '1. I''m not sure about the time range, but weekly intervals might work.

  2. I do not know, any readable color scheme would be fine.

  3. Different color and size of points would be good for highlighting significant
  news events.

  4. I don''t have a specific preference for the style of annotations, as long as
  they are clear and readable.

  5. The y-axis should represent a combination of both unique news titles and descriptions.

  6. I am not sure about fonts or font sizes, just standard readable options are fine.

  7. I have no specific preference for the placement of the legend, wherever it fits
  best.'
