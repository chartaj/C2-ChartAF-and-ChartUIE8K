initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the mean
  radius and the mean perimeter of breast tumor cells. Please color-code the points
  based on the diagnosis category (M for malignant and B for benign). The x-axis should
  represent the radius_mean, and the y-axis should represent the perimeter_mean. Include
  a legend to differentiate between malignant and benign diagnoses. Make sure the
  plot has axis labels and a title, “Mean Radius vs. Mean Perimeter of Breast Tumor
  Cells.” This will help us understand if there is a trend between these two features
  in the dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the scatter plot points?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the marker style or size?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines in the background of the plot?

  4. Should the plot have any annotations or text labels for specific data points?

  5. Do you have any particular font preferences for the title, axis labels, and legend?

  6. Is there any specific placement you prefer for the legend?

  7. Would you like to apply any transformations or scaling to the axes (e.g., log
  scale)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges you want to set for the x-axis or y-axis?

  9. Would you like to add a trendline to the scatter plot to help visualize the correlation?

  10. Is there any additional statistical information you''d like to see on the plot
  (e.g., correlation coefficient)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like to include grid lines in the background.

  4. I do not have any specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. No, standard scaling is fine.

  8. No, the default ranges are fine.

  9. Yes, a trendline would be helpful.

  10. I do not know.'
