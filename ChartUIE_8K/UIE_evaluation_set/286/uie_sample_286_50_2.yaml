initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart to visualize mean radius, perimeter, and area
  over different IDs. Highlight IDs with unique diagnosis categories. Annotate the
  highest and lowest values on the lines. Purpose: Track the progression and correlation
  of these metrics in breast cancer diagnosis.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''radius_mean'', ''perimeter_mean'', and ''area_mean''?

  2. What format or style do you prefer for the highlighting of IDs with unique diagnosis
  categories (e.g., different line styles, colors, or markers)?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for annotating the highest and lowest values (e.g.,

  8. Would you like to include a title or subtitle on the chart? If so, do you have
  any specific text in mind?

  9. Should the x-axis (IDs) be evenly spaced, or should the spacing represent actual
  data intervals?

  10. Do you prefer the y-axis to have a specific range or be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?'
