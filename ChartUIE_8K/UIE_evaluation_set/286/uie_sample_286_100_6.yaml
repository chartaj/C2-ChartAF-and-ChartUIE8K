initial_prompt: I need a column chart that visualizes the average values of the mean
  attributes (like radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, area_mean, etc.) for
  the diagnosis categories (M and B). This should show a comparison between malignant
  (M) and benign (B) tumors across all these mean attributes. Highlight the significant
  differences clearly. Make sure the chart is labeled properly for easy understanding,
  as it will be used for a healthcare presentation on breast cancer diagnosis. The
  x-axis should represent the different attributes, and the y-axis should show their
  average values. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns representing
  malignant (M) and benign (B) tumors?

  2. Would you like to include any annotations or markers to highlight significant
  differences directly on the chart?

  3. Is there a preferred order for the mean attributes to be displayed along the
  x-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style or font for the labels and titles on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include any gridlines or background elements to enhance readability?

  6. Is there any specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of the legend?

  8. Should the chart include error bars to show variability around the mean values?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would like to include annotations or markers to highlight significant
  differences.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a preference for the style or font.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines to enhance readability.

  6. The title should be "Comparison of Mean Attributes Between Malignant and Benign
  Tumors."

  7. I am not sure about the placement and style of the legend.

  8. I do not know if error bars should be included.'
