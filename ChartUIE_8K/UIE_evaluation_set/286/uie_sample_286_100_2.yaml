initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize breast cancer data with a focus on
  early diagnosis. Include text annotations to highlight key metrics like 'radius_mean',
  'texture_mean', and 'area_mean' for better comparison among samples. Highlight variations
  in these metrics across different diagnoses ('M' for malignant and 'B' for benign)
  to make patterns stand out. This will help healthcare professionals to quickly assess
  and identify potential malignancies. Also, highlight any extreme values or outliers
  for further analysis. Ensure the chart is clear, contextual, and aids medical decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different diagnosis
  categories (malignant and benign)?

  2. Would you prefer any particular style or format for the text annotations highlighting
  key metrics?

  3. How would you like extreme values or outliers to be represented on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the legend on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  6. Are there any specific gridline preferences (e.g., color, density) you want on
  the chart?

  7. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or notes on the
  chart?

  8. Are there any specific axis scale preferences (e.g., logarithmic, linear) you
  would like to use for the chart?

  9. Would you prefer the line chart to be displayed with markers on each data point?

  10. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you would like the chart to have?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for different diagnosis
  categories.

  2. I am not sure about the style or format for the text annotations.

  3. I would like extreme values or outliers to be clearly highlighted, maybe with
  a different color or marker style.

  4. I have no specific preference for the layout or positioning of the legend.

  5. I do not know about the font style or size for the labels and annotations.

  6. I am not sure about any specific gridline preferences.

  7. I do not know about including additional contextual information or notes on the
  chart.

  8. I have no specific preference for axis scale.

  9. Yes, I would prefer the line chart to be displayed with markers on each data
  point.

  10. I do not have a specific aspect ratio or size requirement for the chart.'
