initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the mean, standard error, and
  worst values for radius, texture, perimeter, and area across different diagnosis
  types (M and B). This will help visualize differences and patterns in breast cancer
  data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the grouped
  bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be arranged in a particular order (e.g., by diagnosis type or
  by attribute)?

  3. Do you want to include error bars to depict standard error values?

  4. Would you prefer to have axis labels and titles for clarity?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you would like to use for the y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preference for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to identify different diagnosis types and value
  types (mean, SE, worst)?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart
  (e.g., labels, title, legend)?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific data points or trends within the chart?

  10. Do you want to add annotations or notes to provide additional insights or explanations?'
