initial_prompt: Create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of tumor sizes
  using the 'radius_mean' column from the breast cancer dataset. Ensure the x-axis
  represents different range bins for the radius mean and the y-axis shows the frequency
  of occurrences within each bin. This will help identify the most common tumor sizes
  in the dataset. Please ensure the bins are appropriately sized to capture meaningful
  insights without being too granular or too broad. Include labels and a title for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  2. What labels would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or number of bins on the x-axis?

  4. Are there any specific color schemes or themes you would like for the histogram?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines or not?

  6. Should we add any annotations or markers to highlight certain data points within
  the histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a specific title.

  2. X-axis: "Mean Radius"; Y-axis: "Frequency"

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have any specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.'
