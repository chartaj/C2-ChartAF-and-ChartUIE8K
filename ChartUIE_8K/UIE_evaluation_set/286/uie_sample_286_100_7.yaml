initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize the breast cancer dataset. The x-axis
  should represent the "radius_mean" and the y-axis should be the "texture_mean."
  Different dot colors for each diagnosis category ("M" for Malignant and "B" for
  Benign) would be great to see the distribution clearly. Additionally, the size of
  each dot should represent the "area_mean" to add another dimension of analysis.
  This will help me understand the relationship between radius, texture, and area
  in diagnosing breast cancer.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating the diagnosis
  categories?

  2. What is your preferred dot size or range for representing the "area_mean" values?

  3. Should the axes have specific limits or a certain range for "radius_mean" and
  "texture_mean"?

  4. Do you have preferences for the appearance of the axes (e.g., gridlines, ticks,
  labels)?

  5. Would you like to add any specific annotations or labels to the data points?

  6. Do you need any additional statistical information to be displayed on the chart
  (e.g., mean lines, trend lines)?

  7. Is there a preferred background style or theme for the chart (e.g., light, dark)?

  8. Do you want the chart to include a legend for the color-coded diagnosis categories
  and dot sizes?

  9. Would you like to specify any data transformation or scaling for the "radius_mean"
  and "texture_mean" axes?

  10. Should the chart include any supplementary information, such as a title, subtitle,
  or footnotes?'
