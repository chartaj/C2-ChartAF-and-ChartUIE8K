initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the breast cancer dataset, plotting
  'radius_mean' on the x-axis and 'area_mean' on the y-axis. Differentiate the points
  by 'diagnosis' to understand how measurements cluster between malignant and benign
  cases.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent malignant
  and benign cases?

  2. Would you like to include axis labels and titles? If so, what should they be?

  3. Do you prefer a legend to identify the different diagnoses? If yes, where would
  you like it positioned (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  4. Do you have specific requirements or preferences for the size and shape of the
  scatter plot points?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot? If so, should they
  be major, minor, or both?

  6. Is there a specific style or theme you prefer for the scatter plot (e.g., minimalist,
  scientific, colorful)?

  7. Should the axes have specific ranges or should they auto-scale based on the data?

  8. Do you want to include any annotations or labels on specific points in the scatter
  plot? If yes, please specify which points and the details for the annotations.

  9. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the text in the scatter
  plot, such as labels and titles?'
