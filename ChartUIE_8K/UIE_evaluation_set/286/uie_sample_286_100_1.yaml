initial_prompt: Create a violin plot showing the distribution of 'radius_mean' values
  for each 'diagnosis' category (M and B). Highlight the mean and median values within
  each violin for comparison. Use text annotations to display the actual mean and
  median values on the plot. This visualization aims to provide a clear understanding
  of the range and central tendencies of 'radius_mean' in malignant and benign cases,
  aiding in the assessment and differentiation of breast cancer diagnostics. Enhance
  the chart with color differentiation to make the categories distinct for better
  visual analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for differentiating the ''diagnosis''
  categories (M and B)?

  2. What color scheme would you like for the highlights of the mean and median values
  within each violin?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations displaying the
  mean and median values?

  4. Would you like any specific titles or labels for the axes and the overall plot?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the violins (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any specific gridline preferences or background styles you would like
  for the plot?

  7. Would you like a legend included in the plot, and if so, where would you like
  it positioned?

  8. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the plot?'
