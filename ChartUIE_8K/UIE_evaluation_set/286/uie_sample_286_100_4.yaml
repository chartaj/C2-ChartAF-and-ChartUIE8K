initial_prompt: I want a grouped bar chart that compares the mean values of the radius,
  texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry,
  and fractal dimension for different diagnosis types (M and B) in breast cancer data.
  Each group should represent a specific diagnosis and within each group, individual
  bars should display the mean values of the different attributes. This will help
  visualize the differences in these attributes between malignant and benign cases
  better. Ensure each attribute is labeled clearly along the x-axis, and diagnosis
  types are distinguished by different colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  the diagnosis types (M and B)?

  2. Would you prefer any specific ordering of the attributes on the x-axis?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  4. Would you like to include any specific grid lines, or should they be omitted
  from the chart?

  5. Is there a particular way you want the legend to be displayed (e.g., position,
  format)?

  6. Would you like to add data labels to individual bars showing their mean values?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart title text?

  8. Is there any specific background color or styling preference for the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or callouts on the chart to highlight
  key points?

  10. Do you have any preference for the spacing between the bars within each group?'
