initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the dataset provided, focusing on the change
  in forest area from 1990 to 2020 by country. Highlight the deforestation rates from
  2015-2020 and areas affected by fire in 2015. Use color intensity to show higher
  and lower values. Label each country clearly, and ensure the proportions of forest
  area relative to total land area for 2020 are well-delineated. The heatmap should
  provide a visual summary of forest area trends over the decades and visualize the
  impact of deforestation and fires globally.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for showing higher and lower values
  in the heatmap?

  2. How prominently would you like the labels of each country to be displayed?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the color intensity range used to highlight
  the deforestation rates and areas affected by fire?

  4. Would you prefer the proportions of forest area relative to total land area for
  2020 to be displayed using a specific color gradient or pattern?

  5. Is there any specific layout arrangement you would like for the countries in
  the heatmap (e.g., alphabetical order, by continent, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the labels of each country to be displayed clearly but not too prominently.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. By continent, please.'
