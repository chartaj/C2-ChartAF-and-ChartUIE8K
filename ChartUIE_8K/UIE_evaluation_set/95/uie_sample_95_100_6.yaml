initial_prompt: 'Please create an area chart showcasing Global Forest Insights from
  1990-2020, focusing on the changes in forest area over time across different countries
  and regions. Use the columns ''Forest Area, 1990'', ''Forest Area, 2000'', ''Forest
  Area, 2010'', ''Forest Area, 2015'', and ''Forest Area, 2020''. Highlight the trends
  and provide a proportional analysis of total land area. Include the ''Forest Area
  as a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020''. This will visualize deforestation and
  reforestation patterns over the three decades.

  '
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the area chart, especially
  to distinguish between different countries and regions?

  2. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal)?

  3. Are there any particular countries or regions you would like to emphasize or
  highlight more prominently in the chart?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between each country''s data?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for the trend lines (smooth, straight, etc.)?

  6. Would you like to add data labels to the chart, showing specific values at key
  points (e.g., start and end years)?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight significant
  events or periods?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines to assist in reading the values?

  9. Should the chart include a secondary y-axis to represent ''Forest Area as a Proportion
  of Total Land Area, 2020''?

  10. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, do you
  have specific text in mind?'
