initial_prompt: I want to visualize the global forest data from 1990 to 2020. Please
  create a histogram showing the distribution of countries based on their forest area
  in 2020. Use the 'Forest Area, 2020' column to create the bins for the histogram.
  The x-axis should represent different ranges of forest areas, and the y-axis should
  show the number of countries falling into each range. Additionally, please highlight
  the average forest area in 2020 with a vertical line. This will help me understand
  how forest distribution varies among countries globally.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. What color would you like the vertical line (representing the average forest
  area) to be?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins for the histogram?

  4. Would you like the x-axis and y-axis to have specific labels or titles?

  5. Is there a specific range for the x-axis you would like to set?

  6. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the histogram include a legend for clarity?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or gridlines?

  9. Would you like to include any specific annotations or callouts on the chart?

  10. Do you have a title in mind for the histogram?'
