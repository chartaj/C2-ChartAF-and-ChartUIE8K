initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the forest area from 1990 to
  2020 for different countries. Use the columns 'Country and Area', 'Forest Area,
  1990', 'Forest Area, 2000', 'Forest Area, 2010', 'Forest Area, 2015', and 'Forest
  Area, 2020'. Each bar should represent a country, with different segments for each
  year. Highlight how the forest area has changed over time for each country. Use
  a different color for each year. Add labels on the x-axis for countries and the
  y-axis for forest area. Include a legend to clearly differentiate between the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  years in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer any specific arrangement or ordering of the countries on the
  x-axis?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines on the y-axis for better readability?

  5. Would you like the chart to display numerical values on the bars for each segment?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the width or height of the bars in the
  chart?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location, such as the top, bottom,
  left, or right of the chart?

  8. Are there any countries you specifically want to highlight or focus on in the
  chart?

  9. Would you like to include any additional annotations or comments on the chart
  to emphasize particular trends or data points?

  10. Do you have any preference for how we should handle missing data points for
  certain countries or years?'
