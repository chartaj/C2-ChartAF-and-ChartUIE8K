initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize the global forest area data
  from 1990 to 2020. Use "Country and Area" for the x-axis, "Forest Area as a Proportion
  of Total Land Area, 2020" for the y-axis, and "Forest Area, 2020" for the bubble
  size. Highlight trends and regional differences in forest coverage over time. Include
  a legend and tooltip for easier interpretation. Label axes appropriately and use
  distinct colors for different regions. Provide data points for key countries to
  show deforestation rates between 2015-2020, adding depth to the visual insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to represent different
  regions?

  2. Would you like to specify any particular countries that must be highlighted in
  the chart?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include for key countries?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style or format for the axis labels and legend?
