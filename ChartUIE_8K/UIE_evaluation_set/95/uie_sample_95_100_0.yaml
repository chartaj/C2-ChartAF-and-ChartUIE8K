initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize global forest area changes from 1990
  to 2020. Highlight significant changes and deforestation rates between 2015-2020,
  emphasizing regions with extreme values. Use text annotations to display important
  data points and notes about the proportion of forest area relative to total land
  area. The chart should provide a clear summary of trends per decade, identifying
  areas with unusual deforestation or reforestation trends. Add contextual comments
  about the environmental impact and global comparisons. This visualization will help
  policymakers and researchers understand and address forest area changes.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for highlighting significant changes and
  extreme values?

  2. What style of text annotations do you prefer for displaying important data points
  and notes?

  3. Do you want a specific format for contextual comments about environmental impacts
  and global comparisons?

  4. Should the chart include legends or labels for different regions?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the box chart (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  6. Are there specific regions you want to emphasize or display in more detail?

  7. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations and
  labels?

  8. Do you require any specific references or footnotes on the chart about data sources
  or methodology?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the chart should include legends or labels for different regions.

  6. Yes, I want to emphasize the Amazon basin, Southeast Asia, and Central Africa.

  7. I do not have any specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include references or footnotes about the data sources or methodology
  used.'
