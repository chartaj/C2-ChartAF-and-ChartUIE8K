initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the age-standardized suicide rates
  per 100,000 population across different countries for the year 2019. On the X-axis,
  we'll have the different countries (Location), and on the Y-axis, the suicide rates
  (FactValueNumeric) for both sexes combined, male, and female (Dim1). This will help
  understand the gender differences in suicide rates among various nations. Add data
  points for each combination of country and gender, with varying colors or markers
  to distinguish between male, female, and both sexes categories. Ensure it's clear
  and distinguishable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between male,
  female, and both sexes categories?

  2. Would you like to use specific markers (e.g., circles, triangles, squares) to
  represent different genders?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the size of the markers in the scatter
  plot?

  4. Should we add gridlines for better readability, or do you prefer a cleaner look
  without them?

  5. Do you want any specific formatting for the X-axis labels, such as rotation or
  font size?

  6. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., right, bottom, top)?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis titles and labels?

  8. Should we include a title for the scatter plot? If yes, do you have a specific
  title in mind?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or text that you want to include on the
  plot for better context or clarity?

  10. Are there specific ranges or limits you would like to set for the X-axis (countries)
  and Y-axis (suicide rates)?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please rotate the X-axis labels by 45 degrees for better readability.

  6. Legend at the bottom would be fine.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, the title should be "Age-Standardized Suicide Rates by Country and Gender
  (2019)".
