initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize age-standardized suicide rates (per
  100,000 population) for different countries within the Americas region from 2000
  to 2019. Use the columns 'Period' for the x-axis and 'FactValueNumeric' for the
  y-axis. Different lines should represent 'Male', 'Female', and 'Both sexes'. Add
  text annotations to highlight key data points or trends, and use highlights to emphasize
  significant changes or outliers. This visualization will help to understand the
  trends in suicide rates over the years and spot significant differences between
  genders.
