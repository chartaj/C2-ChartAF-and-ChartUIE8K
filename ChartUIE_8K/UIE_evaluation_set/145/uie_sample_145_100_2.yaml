initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing the age-standardized suicide
  rates for specific locations in the Americas (e.g., Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados).
  Group bars by gender (Male, Female, Both sexes) and display the data for the latest
  year, 2019. Use text annotations to highlight the exact suicide rates and their
  confidence intervals for each group. Employ highlights to differentiate between
  genders visually. This chart will help in understanding the suicide rate differences
  by gender in various countries within the Americas. Ensure axes are properly labeled
  and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  genders (Male, Female, Both sexes)?

  2. What level of granularity would you like for the axis labels (e.g., should country
  names be abbreviated or fully spelled out)?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you prefer the confidence intervals to be displayed using error bars or another
  method?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  6. Should the chart include country-specific symbols or flags next to the country
  names for better identification?

  7. Do you have a specific title or subtitle in mind for the chart?

  8. Is there any additional descriptive text or context you would like to be included
  in the chart area?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for colors.

  2. Fully spelled out country names would be preferred.

  3. I am not sure about specific fonts or font sizes.

  4. I am not sure, maybe error bars could work.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific title in mind.

  8. I do not have any additional descriptive text to include.'
