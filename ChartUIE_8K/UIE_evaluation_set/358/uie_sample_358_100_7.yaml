initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of age groups among
  students in online education. The data should show the frequency of each age group
  ('16-20', '21-25', etc.) present in the dataset. Label the x-axis as "Age Groups"
  and the y-axis as "Number of Students." Use different colors to differentiate the
  bars. Make sure to include a title, possibly "Distribution of Age Groups in Online
  Education," to make the chart clear and informative. The chart will help in understanding
  which age group is most prevalent in online education.
