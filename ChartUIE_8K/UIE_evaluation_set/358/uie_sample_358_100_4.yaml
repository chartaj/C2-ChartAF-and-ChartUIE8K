initial_prompt: I have data on students' adaptability levels in online education,
  including demographics like age, gender, education level, and more. I want a column
  chart to compare the "Adaptivity Level" across different "Education Level" groups.
  Use the sample data provided to create this visualization. Include categories like
  "College" and "University" on the x-axis, and plot their corresponding "Adaptivity
  Level" on the y-axis. This will help analyze how education level affects adaptability
  in online learning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars?

  3. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the categories on the x-axis?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the y-axis for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular font style and size you would prefer for the text elements?

  8. Should the chart display the exact values of "Adaptivity Level" on the y-axis?

  chart?
