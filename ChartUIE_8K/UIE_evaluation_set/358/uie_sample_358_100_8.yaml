initial_prompt: I want a table chart showing the adaptability level of students in
  online education based on different factors. Please include columns for Gender,
  Age, Education Level, Institution Type, IT Student, Location, Load-shedding, Financial
  Condition, Internet Type, Network Type, Class Duration, Self Lms, Device, and Adaptivity
  Level. The rows should represent individual student data. This table should help
  in understanding the correlation between these variables and student adaptability
  in online learning environments. Make sure to highlight any patterns or notable
  insights derived from the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the table
  chart?

  2. Would you like the table to include row numbering or student IDs for easier reference?

  3. Are there any specific columns you would like to prioritize or highlight in the
  table?

  4. Are you interested in any specific statistical metrics or summaries to be included
  alongside the table (e.g., averages, standard deviations)?

  5. Do you prefer the data to be sorted by a particular column by default?

  6. Should notable patterns or insights be highlighted using colors, icons, or text
  annotations?

  7. Would you like to use any specific font styles or sizes for better readability?

  8. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation (landscape/portrait) of
  the table if it will be printed?

  larger text for readability)?'
