initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot chart for the "Indian Cities Distance Dataset".
  The chart should visualize the distances between different city pairs listed in
  the dataset. Use the "Origin" on the x-axis and plot individual dots for each "Destination"
  on the y-axis, with the "Distance" determining the position of each dot. This will
  help in quickly identifying the relative distances between cities. Ensure all unique
  city pairs are represented, and make the chart easy to interpret for transportation
  and logistics analysis. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the dots or background
  of the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to include grid lines for better readability? If yes,
  should they be both horizontal and vertical, or just one of the two?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each dot indicating the exact distance values,
  or should it only display dots?

  4. Do you want any specific markers or shapes for the dots, or are default circular
  dots acceptable?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend or additional annotations for better
  understanding?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the distances be represented in km or miles, or should it be indicated
  in both units?

  8. Is there a specific order you want the cities (Origins) to be displayed on the
  x-axis (e.g., alphabetical or by some other criteria)?

  9. Are there any specific city pairs or distances that you want to highlight or
  emphasize in the chart?

  10. Would you like to set a limit on the range of distances displayed on the y-axis,
  or should it auto-adjust to the data?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would prefer the chart to include grid lines. Both horizontal and vertical
  grid lines would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Default circular dots are acceptable.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Kilometers (km) are fine.

  8. Alphabetical order for the cities (Origins) on the x-axis would be good.

  9. No, I do not have any specific city pairs or distances to highlight.

  10. It should auto-adjust to the data.'
