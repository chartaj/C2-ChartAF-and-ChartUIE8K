initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique
  city pairs (Origin-Destination combinations) in the Indian Cities Distance Dataset.
  The chart should highlight the top 10 most common routes by frequency, showing how
  often each route appears within the dataset. Make sure the pie chart segments are
  labeled with the Origin-Destination pairs and the corresponding percentage or count.
  This chart will help understand the most frequently traveled routes between various
  cities in India, which is crucial for transportation and logistics planning. Include
  a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart segments?

  2. Would you prefer the pie chart to display percentages, counts, or both for each
  segment?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the labels and
  legend?

  4. Should the pie chart have 3D effects or remain flat?

  5. Do you want the chart background to be a specific color or pattern?

  6. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the pie chart?

  7. Would you like the segment labels to be displayed inside the pie chart or outside
  with leader lines?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or highlights besides the legend to further
  clarify the data?

  9. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) on the chart?

  10. Are there any specific routes (Origin-Destination pairs) you would like to highlight
  distinctly in the chart?'
