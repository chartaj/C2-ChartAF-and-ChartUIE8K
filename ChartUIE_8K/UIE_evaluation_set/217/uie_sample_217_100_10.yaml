initial_prompt: I have a dataset that shows distances between various Indian cities.
  It includes columns for origin, destination, and distance. I would like a column
  chart that visualizes the distance between each pair of cities. The x-axis should
  represent the Origin-Destination pairs, and the y-axis should represent the distances.
  Ensure the chart is easy to read and compare the distances directly. The dataset
  mentioned does not contain any missing values, so you should be able to use the
  entire dataset for visualization. Include appropriate labels and title for the chart.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for coloring the columns in the chart?

  2. What style or font would you prefer for the labels and title?

  3. Should the column chart have grid lines for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the Origin-Destination pairs
  to be displayed?

  5. Would you like the distances to be displayed on or above the columns for quick
  reference?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (horizontal
  or rotated)?

  7. Should there be any specific annotations or highlights on certain Origin-Destination
  pairs?

  8. Would you like to include a legend in the chart, even if the information is relatively
  straightforward?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s background and border style?'
