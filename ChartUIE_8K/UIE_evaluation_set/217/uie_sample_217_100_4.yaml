initial_prompt: I have a dataset about distances between various Indian cities from
  the transportation and logistics sector. I would like to create a Choropleth map
  that visualizes the distances between different origins and destinations. The map
  should highlight city pairs based on the distance value, showing connections between
  cities with graduated color scales indicating the distance. Ideally, cities with
  shorter distances should be in one color, while longer distances should be in another.
  This visualization should help in understanding the spatial distribution and connectivity
  between these key locations in India.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  to use for representing shorter and longer distances on the Choropleth map?

  2. Would you like the map to include city names or labels for easier identification
  of the origins and destinations?

  3. Should the map display any additional geographical features such as state boundaries
  or major rivers?

  4. Do you have a preferred geographic projection for the map (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Do you want any specific legend design or placement for indicating the distance
  values on the map?

  6. Are there any specific cities that you would like to emphasize or highlight more
  prominently on the map?

  7. Would you like the map to include a title and/or subtitle? If so, what should
  the text be?

  8. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the map (e.g., modern, classic,
  minimalistic)?

  9. Do you want to include any tooltips or annotations that provide additional information
  about the distances between city pairs when hovered over?'
