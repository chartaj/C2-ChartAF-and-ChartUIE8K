initial_prompt: I have a dataset of distances between Indian cities. I want to create
  a scatter plot to visualize the data. On the x-axis, let's plot the Origin cities,
  and on the y-axis, the Destination cities. Each point on the scatter plot should
  represent the distance between these cities. Please make sure to label the axes
  and provide a title for the chart, such as "Distances Between Indian Cities." This
  visualization will help in understanding the distribution and relationship of travel
  distances among different cities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the chart title and
  axis labels?

  4. Should the points in the scatter plot have different shapes or sizes based on
  specific criteria?

  5. Would you like to include data labels or annotations for specific points on the
  scatter plot?

  6. Do you want to add a legend for the scatter plot points?

  7. Would you prefer the chart to have a specific size or aspect ratio?

  8. Do you want the axes to have specific ranges or should they be auto-scaled based
  on data?

  9. Should there be any specific highlights or markers for distances that meet certain
  conditions, like above or below a threshold?

  10. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart?'
