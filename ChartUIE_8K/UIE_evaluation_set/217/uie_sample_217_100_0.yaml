initial_prompt: I need a parallel coordinates chart visualizing the distances between
  various Indian cities. Use columns for Origin, Destination, and Distance from the
  dataset and highlight the shortest and longest routes to emphasize them visually.
  Annotate a few data points with the exact distances to draw attention to specific
  routes, like those connecting major cities (e.g., Agra to Delhi). This will help
  in understanding transportation and logistics patterns across these cities. Ensure
  annotations provide context for better clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for highlighting the shortest and
  longest routes?

  2. Would you like the annotated distances to be displayed in a specific format (e.g.,
  rounded to the nearest kilometer)?

  3. Are there specific major cities or routes you would like to ensure are annotated
  besides Agra to Delhi?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style of annotation (e.g., arrows, labels)?

  5. Is there a preferred order for displaying the origins and destinations in the
  parallel coordinates chart?

  6. Would you like any additional contextual information to be included in the annotations,
  such as average travel time or transportation mode?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or dimensions of the chart to
  ensure clarity and readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Besides Agra to Delhi, please ensure routes like Mumbai to Bangalore and Chennai
  to Kolkata are annotated.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. I do not know.'
