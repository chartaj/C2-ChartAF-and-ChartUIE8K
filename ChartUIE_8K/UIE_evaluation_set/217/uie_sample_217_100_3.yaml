initial_prompt: Could you create a violin plot for me using the Indian Cities Distance
  Dataset? I want to visualize the distribution of distances between different pairs
  of origin and destination cities. Highlight the spread and density of distances
  across these city pairs. As the dataset contains information about various cities
  and their respective distances, the plot should allow me to compare the distance
  distributions between multiple origin and destination pairs, if possible. This will
  help me understand the variability in travel distances between different city pairs
  efficiently. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the violin plot?

  2. Would you prefer the plot to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  3. Should the plot include individual data points or summary statistics such as
  means or medians?

  4. Do you want to group the distances by both origin and destination cities, or
  just by one of these attributes?

  5. Are there any particular origin and destination city pairs you would like to
  highlight or focus on?

  6. Should the plot include axes labels and titles? If yes, please specify any preferences
  for the wording.

  7. Do you have any preference for the scale of the axes (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included in the plot? If yes, what specific details
  should it contain?'
