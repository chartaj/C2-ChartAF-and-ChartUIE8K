initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization of the Indian Cities Distance
  Dataset. Highlight the varying distances between origins and destinations to showcase
  patterns in transportation logistics. Ensure different cities and their connections
  are distinctly represented.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the treemap to
  represent different cities and their connections distinctly?

  2. Should the treemap include labels for each city pair directly on the chart, or
  would you prefer a tooltip to reveal this information upon hovering?

  3. How would you like the distances to be represented (e.g., size of the rectangles,
  color intensity, or gradient)?

  4. Would you prefer a gradient scale legend to be included to help interpret the
  varying distances?

  5. Do you have specific preferences for the font style and size for the city labels
  and any legends or annotations?

  6. Is there a need to focus on certain cities or regions more prominently in the
  treemap visualization?

  7. Should the chart include any specific annotations or highlights for particularly
  significant distances or connections?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout or structure within the treemap to reflect
  the geographical proximity of cities realistically?'
