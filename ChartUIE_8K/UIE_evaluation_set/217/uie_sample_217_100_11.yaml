initial_prompt: I have a dataset with distances between various Indian cities from
  the transportation and logistics sector. The data includes 'Origin', 'Destination',
  and 'Distance'. I want to visualize this using a Treemap chart. Each section in
  the Treemap should represent a unique origin city, and within each section, there
  should be further divisions for each destination city showing the distance traveled.
  This way, I can easily see the distribution and distance relationships between cities.
  Please make sure that the sizes of the blocks in the Treemap correspond to the distances.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you''d like the
  Treemap to use?

  2. Should the distances be represented using a specific unit of measurement or format?

  3. Would you like to include labels for the distance values within each block, or
  should these be displayed on hover?

  4. Do you prefer a particular layout style for the Treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  5. Should the blocks for origin cities have a specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  size-based)?

  6. Would you like a legend to differentiate the origin cities?

  7. Do you want to highlight any specific origin or destination cities?

  8. Should the chart include a title, subtitle, or any descriptive text?

  9. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the Treemap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color schemes or palettes.

  2. I do not know; any standard unit of measurement is fine.

  3. I would like to include labels for the distance values within each block.

  4. I prefer a squarified layout style.

  5. I am not sure; maybe alphabetical order is fine.

  6. Yes, a legend to differentiate the origin cities would be helpful.

  7. I do not know if specific cities should be highlighted.

  8. Yes, please include a title and any necessary descriptive text.

  9. I have no specific preference for the size or aspect ratio.'
