initial_prompt: I have data on distances between Indian cities, specifically origins
  and destinations with their distances. I'm looking to create a geographic heatmap
  that visually represents these distances. The heatmap should show the cities with
  nodes and use color intensity or gradients to indicate the distance between the
  origins and destinations. Highlight major routes such as from Agra to Delhi, Lucknow,
  and Kanpur, and ensure that the entire range of the dataset is represented. Include
  a legend to interpret the distances and ensure the visualization is clear and easy
  to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme or palette used in
  the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to specify any particular dataset ranges to be highlighted with
  specific colors?

  3. Should the nodes (representing cities) be depicted with specific sizes or shapes?

  4. Are there any particular geographical boundaries (like state borders) that you
  would like to include in the map for context?

  5. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator) or region focus for the
  map?

  6. Should there be any additional annotations or labels on the map, apart from the
  legend?

  7. How detailed should the legend be (e.g., detailed with increments or more general
  gradients)?

  8. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the visualization?

  9. Are there any font preferences for labels and annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. More general gradients would be fine.

  8. No specific titles or subtitles needed.

  9. I do not have any font preferences.'
