initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the "age" distribution from the Heart
  Disease Dataset. Highlight important age ranges associated with higher heart disease
  risk. Use text annotations to mark age intervals with the most data points. This
  visualization helps to understand the age demographics most affected by heart disease,
  aiding in targeted health interventions. Ensure the chart is easy to read, with
  clear labels and legends. This way, one can immediately grasp which age groups have
  higher incidences, making it practical for health professionals to analyze and interpret
  the data effectively.

  age groups of 10 years)?

  2. Is there a specific color scheme you prefer for the histogram and highlighted
  age ranges?

  3. Do you have a preference for font style and size for the text annotations and
  labels?

  4. Would you like the important age ranges to be highlighted in a specific way (e.g.,
  distinct colors or patterns)?

  5. Are there any particular standards for legends and labels you would like to follow?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical)?

  7. Are there any additional details or elements you would like included in the chart
  for clarity?'
