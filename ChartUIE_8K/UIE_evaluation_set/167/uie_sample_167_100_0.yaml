initial_prompt: Please create a Box chart to visualize the age distribution categorized
  by chest pain type from the Heart Disease Dataset. Highlight outliers to emphasize
  unusual data points. Add text annotations for the median values of each chest pain
  type to focus the viewer's attention on central tendencies. The chart should help
  to identify any significant age differences between the various chest pain categories,
  which could be crucial for understanding age-related risks associated with different
  types of chest pain in heart disease patients.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be marked with specific colors or shapes?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations of
  the median values?

  4. Should the chart include a grid or background lines for better readability?

  5. Do you have a title preference for the chart?

  6. Would you like to include axis labels and, if so, do you have specific wording
  in mind?

  7. Should the legend for the chest pain categories be placed in a specific location
  on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the width or spacing of the boxes in the box chart?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical information displayed on the chart,
  such as quartiles or confidence intervals?'
