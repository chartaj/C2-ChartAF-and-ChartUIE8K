initial_prompt: I'd like to see a line chart showing the variation in cholesterol
  levels, resting blood pressure, and max heart rate across different age groups,
  differentiating by sex. This should help us analyze heart disease trends in this
  dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between sexes?

  2. Would you like the age groups to be grouped into specific ranges (e.g., 10-year
  intervals)?

  3. Should the chart include markers on the data points for better visibility?

  4. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for males and females?

  5. Should the chart display a legend indicating cholesterol levels, resting blood
  pressure, and max heart rate?

  6. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations for critical points
  or observations on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Should we include gridlines for easier interpretation of data values?

  9. Is there a particular order you want the variables (cholesterol, resting blood
  pressure, max heart rate) to be displayed in?

  10. Would you prefer to see confidence intervals or error bars for the data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, 10-year intervals would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I prefer solid lines for both.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I would like clear axis labels and a title.
