initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the heart disease dataset. Highlight
  the importance of variables like 'age', 'cholesterol', and 'max heart rate' by modifying
  their appearance. Use text annotations to highlight high cholesterol levels and
  high resting blood pressure. The purpose is to understand risk factors associated
  with heart disease. The chart should effectively display data comparisons across
  different categories for better insights into heart health. This visualization will
  help focus attention on critical health parameters, offering clarity on their impact
  on heart disease.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for highlighting the variables ''age'',
  ''cholesterol'', and ''max heart rate'' on the chart?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations to be represented or formatted?

  3. Are there specific thresholds for ''high cholesterol levels'' and ''high resting
  blood pressure'' you would like to use for the annotations?

  4. Do you have a specific order in which you want the categories to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  5. Would you like any particular styling for the axes titles and labels (e.g., font
  size, font color)?

  6. Is there any specific way you want the data comparisons to be grouped or categorized?

  7. Do you have preferences for the overall layout and design of the chart (e.g.,
  gridlines, background color)?

  8. Are there any other variables or data points that you would like to include or
  emphasize besides the specified ones?

  9. Would you like a specific title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  10. Are there any other specific visual elements or annotations you would like to
  include on the chart?'
