initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the Heart Disease Dataset. Plot 'age' on
  the x-axis and 'cholesterol' on the y-axis. Use different colors to differentiate
  between the 'sex' category (0 for female, 1 for male). Include a legend to indicate
  the sex of the individuals. Make sure to label the axes and title the chart appropriately.
  Additionally, use different markers to represent the 'target' variable (0 for no
  disease, 1 for disease). This will help visualize the relation between age, cholesterol
  level, and the occurrence of heart disease.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or specific colors you would
  like to use for differentiating between the sex categories?

  2. Is there a specific title you would prefer for the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the labels of the x-axis (''age'') and
  y-axis (''cholesterol'')?

  4. For markers representing the ''target'' variable, do you have any preferred shapes
  or symbols you would like to use for ''no disease'' and ''disease''?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the chart
  text (title, axis labels, legend)?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the position of the legend on the chart
  (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  7. Would you like to add any additional annotations or highlights to the chart to
  emphasize particular data points or trends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, maybe "Heart Disease: Age vs Cholesterol Levels".

  3. No specific preferences.

  4. I do not know, just something distinguishable.

  5. No specific preferences.

  6. Top right might be good.

  7. I am not sure.'
