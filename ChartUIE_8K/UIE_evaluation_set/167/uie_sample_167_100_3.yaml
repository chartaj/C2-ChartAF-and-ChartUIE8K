initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the "Heart Disease Dataset". Specifically,
  one line should represent "age" and another line for "max heart rate". Both lines
  should plot across the same set of patients. The x-axis should be patient index
  and the y-axis for both lines should represent their respective values. Add a legend
  to differentiate between age and max heart rate, and ensure the chart is easy to
  interpret. Please ensure the chart is clear and informative, reflecting the heart
  health data effectively. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''age'' and ''max heart rate''?

  2. Would you like to display grid lines on the chart for easier interpretation?

  3. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) of ''age''
  and ''max heart rate''?

  5. Would you like to add any annotations or markers on the chart for specific data
  points?

  6. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so, do you have specific text for
  these titles?

  7. Do you want the chart to have a specific background color or theme (light, dark,
  custom)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the y-axis values?

  9. Would you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific location on the chart
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  10. Is there any additional context or textual information you would like to include
  on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would like to display grid lines on the chart.

  3. I am not sure about the font style and size, just make it clear and readable.

  4. I do not know, any style that makes it easy to differentiate the lines is fine.

  5. I am not sure about annotations or markers, maybe just make sure key points are
  visible.

  6. Yes, please include axis titles. Something like "Patient Index" for the x-axis
  and "Values" for the y-axis.

  7. I have no specific preference for background color or theme.

  8. I do not have any specific ranges or limits in mind for the y-axis values.

  9. I would prefer the legend to be placed at the bottom of the chart.

  10. No additional context or textual information is needed.'
