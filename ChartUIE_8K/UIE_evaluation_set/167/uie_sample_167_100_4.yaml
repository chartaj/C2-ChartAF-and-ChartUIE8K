initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the age distribution of patients
  grouped by chest pain type. Each bar should represent a different age group (e.g.,
  30-39, 40-49, etc.), and segments within each bar should show proportions of the
  four chest pain types (0, 1, 2, 3). Use different colors for each chest pain type
  to make the distinctions clear. The x-axis should represent the age groups, and
  the y-axis should represent the count of patients. Title the chart "Age Distribution
  by Chest Pain Type". This should help identify if certain age groups are more prone
  to specific chest pain types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to represent
  the different chest pain types?

  2. Would you like any additional information or annotations on the chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart title and labels?

  4. Is there a specific order you would like the age groups to be displayed on the
  x-axis?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, do you
  have a preference for their style?

  6. Do you require a legend to identify the different chest pain types? If yes, do
  you have preferences for its placement?

  7. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  8. Would you like to add data labels to each segment of the bars?

  9. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  10. Is there any additional text or notes you would like to include within or alongside
  the chart?'
