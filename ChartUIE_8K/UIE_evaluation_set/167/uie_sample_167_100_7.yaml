initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the Heart Disease Dataset to visualize
  the correlation between different attributes such as 'age', 'sex', 'chest pain type',
  'resting bp s', 'cholesterol', 'fasting blood sugar', 'resting ecg', 'max heart
  rate', 'exercise angina', 'oldpeak', 'ST slope', and 'target'. This will help us
  understand how these variables interact with each other and identify potential indicators
  of heart disease.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include color gradients to indicate different levels of correlation
  strength?

  3. Should the heatmap display correlation values (numbers) within each cell?

  4. Do you prefer any specific range for the correlation values (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  5. Would you like to have labels on the axes to include full or abbreviated attribute
  names?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color scale?

  7. Do you have any font size preferences for labels and titles on the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to cluster similar attributes together in the heatmap for better
  visualization?

  9. Do you have any specific layout preferences for the heatmap (e.g., aspect ratio,
  size of the chart)?

  10. Would you like to include grid lines or borders between the cells for better
  readability?

  11. Are there any specific attributes among the given list that you want to highlight
  more prominently?

  12. Do you need a specific title or annotation to be added to the heatmap?'
