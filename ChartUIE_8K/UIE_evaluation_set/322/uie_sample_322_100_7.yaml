initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to analyze the stock market data for Google.
  Plot the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' prices on the y-axis. Each point should
  represent a specific date with its closing stock price. Use different colors to
  highlight trends over the years. Add markers for significant dates, like Google's
  IPO and other key events. Ensure that the chart is clear and easy to interpret for
  trend analysis and historical performance insights. A legend and labels for axes
  would be helpful. Make sure the visualization is engaging and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight trends
  over the years?

  2. Are there any specific significant dates or key events you would like to be marked,
  apart from Google''s IPO?

  3. What type and size of markers would you prefer for the significant dates?

  4. Do you have any particular style or formatting preferences for the legend and
  axis labels?

  5. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the font style and size used in the chart?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to include on the
  chart?

  8. Would you like to see any additional statistical overlays (such as trendlines)
  on the scatter plot?'
