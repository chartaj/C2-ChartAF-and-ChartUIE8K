initial_prompt: I need a bar chart showing the daily opening and closing stock prices
  for Google from the provided CSV data. Specifically, display the 'Open' and 'Close'
  prices on the y-axis against the date on the x-axis. Highlight significant changes.
  Include a key to differentiate between the 'Open' and 'Close' data points. Also,
  explain any visible trends or patterns in the stock prices over time. Make sure
  the data for the founding years of Google is clearly represented to provide historical
  insight. The chart should be easy to interpret even for someone without a finance
  background. Thank you.
