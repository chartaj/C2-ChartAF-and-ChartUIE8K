initial_prompt: I want a violin plot chart to visualize Google's stock market data
  in its founding years. The chart should display the distribution of the 'Open',
  'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices. Make sure to highlight key points like the highest
  and lowest prices to emphasize significant trends. Also, add text annotations to
  specific data points to highlight important values. This will help in understanding
  the performance over different dates, with focus on notable shifts in stock prices.
  Use colors to make outliers stand out. The goal is to quickly grasp the stock's
  volatility and trends from 2004 to 2008.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Are there specific text annotations you want on the highest and lowest prices,
  or any other key points?

  3. Should the date range be broken down further into months or quarters, or keep
  it yearly?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for the violin plot, like a smooth or rigid
  kernel density estimate?

  5. Would you like grid lines or any other guide marks to be included for better
  readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font or size of text annotations and labels?'

  2. Yes, please add text annotations on the highest and lowest prices.

  3. I am not sure.
