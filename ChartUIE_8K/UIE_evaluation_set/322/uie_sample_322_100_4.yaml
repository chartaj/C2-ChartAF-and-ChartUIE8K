initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize historical stock market data
  for Google. The data contains attributes like Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj
  Close, and Volume spanning Google's founding years. Each box should represent the
  distribution of stock prices (Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close) over these years,
  showcasing central tendency and variability. Highlight outliers, if present. Also,
  include the trading Volume as an additional dimension, perhaps with color intensity
  or box width. The chart should help analyze stock performance trends and volatility
  over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  years or volume intensity?

  2. Should the x-axis be divided by specific time intervals, such as months, quarters,
  or years?

  3. Do you want to include a legend for trading volume, indicating different color
  intensities or box widths?

  4. Is there a specific range of years you would like to focus on, or should all
  historical data be included?

  5. Do you prefer any particular order for the box plots (e.g., chronological)?

  6. Would you like to add any specific annotations or markers to highlight significant
  events or trends?

  7. Do you prefer any specific style (e.g., traditional, modern, minimalistic) for
  the overall appearance of the chart?'
