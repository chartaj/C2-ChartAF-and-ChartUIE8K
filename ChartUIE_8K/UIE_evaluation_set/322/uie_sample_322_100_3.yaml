initial_prompt: I need a candlestick chart for analyzing Google's stock price movements
  during its founding years. Use data from the CSV file, including columns like Date,
  Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. I want to visualize daily stock performance
  from 2004 onward. Ensure the candlestick chart plots the opening, closing, high,
  and low prices. Highlight any significant volume changes, especially during the
  early years. This will help me understand the initial market reaction and trends
  for Google's stock. Please make the chart interactive, if possible, for a more detailed
  analysis.
