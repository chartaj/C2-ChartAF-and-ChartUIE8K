initial_prompt: I want a box plot visualization that shows the distribution of Max_Speed,
  Mileage, Power, and Weight for different car Types from a car dataset. Summarize
  key statistics and highlight any outliers. The chart should help identify trends
  or unusual values within these categories. Include text annotations for specific
  outliers, noting their values and significance. Utilize different shades or colors
  to distinguish between car types, emphasizing any remarkable differences between
  them. This visualization will be used to understand the general performance and
  attributes of various types of cars.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to distinguish between
  car types?

  2. Would you like the box plots to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. How detailed should the text annotations for outliers be? For example, should
  they include just the outlier value or additional context?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for summarizing key statistics (e.g.,
  mean, median, quartiles)?

  5. Are there any specific design elements (grid lines, axis labels, legends) you
  want to emphasize or avoid in the chart?

  6. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for text annotations and labels?

  7. Should the chart include any specific title or subtitle?

  8. Do you want labels for the y-axis to include units of measurement?

  9. Are there any specific car types you want to highlight more prominently in the
  visualization?

  10. How would you like the data to be sorted within the box plots (e.g., by car
  type, by a specific attribute)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer the box plots to be displayed vertically.

  3. Just the outlier value with a brief context would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I want to emphasize grid lines, axis labels, and legends.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific title or subtitle is needed.

  8. Yes, labels for the y-axis should include units of measurement.

  9. I do not know.

  10. By car type.'
