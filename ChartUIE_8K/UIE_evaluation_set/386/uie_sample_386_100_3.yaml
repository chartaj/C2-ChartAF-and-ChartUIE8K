initial_prompt: I am looking for a stacked bar chart that visualizes the given dataset
  about automobiles. Specifically, I'd like to see the comparison of 'Max_Speed',
  'Mileage', 'Power', and 'Weight' across different types of cars ('Sedan', 'Hatchback',
  etc.). The chart should show how these attributes stack up against each other for
  each car type. This will help me understand the performance and efficiency characteristics
  of various types of cars in a single view. Please include a legend to differentiate
  the attributes and make the chart easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different attributes in
  the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars themselves for better readability?

  3. Is there a specific order you would like the car types to be displayed in?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to show percentages or absolute values for the stacked
  segments?

  5. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart to fit into
  your presentation or report?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better reference, or do you prefer a
  cleaner look without them?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?'
