initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the semiconductor shortage
  data. The x-axis should represent the 'DATE', and the y-axis should show 'No. of
  employed peoples in semiconductor industry'. Additionally, I'd like to compare 'Producer
  Price Index(By Industry in $)' on the same chart. Please ensure the chart highlights
  trends affecting the semiconductor industry over time, to understand the relationship
  between employment and producer pricing. Also, indicate any missing or incomplete
  data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart and line representing
  the ''Producer Price Index(By Industry in $)''?

  2. Would you like the missing data points to be distinctly marked, and if so, how?

  3. Do you have a specific format for the dates on the x-axis (e.g., month-year,
  year only)?

  4. Should there be a secondary y-axis for ''Producer Price Index(By Industry in
  $)'', or should both metrics share a single y-axis?

  5. Do you prefer any specific style or thickness for the trend lines?

  6. Are there specific annotations or labels you would like to include on the chart?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  8. Are there any specific threshold lines or markers you want to be added to highlight
  certain values?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, please mark the missing data points distinctly, maybe with a different color
  or an ''X''.

  3. Month-year format for the dates on the x-axis would be ideal.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, include a legend. I do not have a specific preference for its position.

  8. I do not know.'
