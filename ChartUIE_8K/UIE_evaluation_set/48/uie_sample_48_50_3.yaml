initial_prompt: Create a treemap chart from `48.csv`. Visualize the relative importance
  weights, producer price index, number of employed people in the semiconductor industry,
  and industrial production values. Highlight missing values and export-import price
  indexes related to semiconductors distinctly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to distinguish between
  different data attributes or categories?

  2. Would you like to indicate the missing values using a specific color or pattern?

  3. Should the chart display labels on each rectangle, such as the exact values or
  percentages?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout algorithm for the treemap, such as squarify,
  slice, or dice?

  5. How would you like the size of each rectangle to be determinedâ€”by relative importance
  weights or another attribute?

  6. Would you like tooltips or hover information to be included for additional details
  on each data point?

  7. Should there be a legend explaining the colors and patterns used in the treemap?'
