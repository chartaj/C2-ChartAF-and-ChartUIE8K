initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization using the provided data focusing
  on the semiconductor industry. Highlight key metrics such as the Producer Price
  Index, Export and Import Price Indexes for semiconductors, and the number of employed
  people in the semiconductor sector. Make sure to include the contribution to the
  total industrial production index as well. This will help in understanding the relative
  weight and economic impact of the semiconductor shortages and related indices on
  the broader industry. Prioritize clarity and readability in the visualization for
  better insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different metrics in
  the treemap?

  2. Do you have any preference for a particular ordering or hierarchy within the
  treemap?

  3. Would you like labels to be displayed directly on the treemap segments, or would
  you prefer a legend?

  4. Do you prefer to showcase the data with percentages or absolute values on the
  treemap?

  5. Are there any particular visual styles or themes that you would like the treemap
  to adhere to?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio of the treemap?

  7. Would you prefer a border or separation between different sections within the
  treemap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer a legend.

  4. Absolute values would be better.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a border or separation between different sections would be helpful.'
