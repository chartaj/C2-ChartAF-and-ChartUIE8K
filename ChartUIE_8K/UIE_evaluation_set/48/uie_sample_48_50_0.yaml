initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between export/import price
  indices, industrial production, and employment in the semiconductor industry. Highlight
  significant changes over time, focusing on periods with missing values to identify
  potential trends during semiconductor shortages. Add annotations to explain important
  data points or notable trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include color gradients to represent the strength of the correlations?

  3. Do you have any specific annotations or labels you want to be included in the
  heatmap?

  4. How would you prefer missing values to be displayed or handled in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include a timeline or time markers to highlight significant
  periods?

  6. Do you prefer specific notes or text explanations for notable trends and data
  points on the heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific intervals or date ranges you want to focus on?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines or any specific axis formatting?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or orientation of the heatmap
  (horizontal or vertical)?

  10. Are there any specific statistical metrics or thresholds you would like to use
  to highlight significant correlations?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, color gradients to represent the strength of the correlations would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure how missing values should be displayed, maybe just make it clear
  that they are missing.

  5. Yes, a timeline or time markers to highlight significant periods would be helpful.

  6. Yes, specific notes or text explanations for notable trends and data points would
  be useful.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for date ranges.

  8. I am not sure about grid lines or axis formatting.

  9. I do not have a preference for the layout or orientation.

  10. I do not know about specific statistical metrics or thresholds.'
