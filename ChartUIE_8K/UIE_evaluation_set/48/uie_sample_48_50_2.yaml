initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to highlight the trends in semiconductor industry
  employment and price indices over time. Annotate key data points to emphasize significant
  changes. Use different colors to distinguish between Export and Import indices,
  focusing on noticeable fluctuations post-1985.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer to distinguish between Export and Import
  indices?

  2. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the different indices?

  3. Are there specific dates or years you want to highlight with annotations?

  4. Would you like to set a specific range for the y-axis values?

  5. Do you prefer a particular marker style or shape for the scatter plot points?

  6. Is there a specific format for the date on the x-axis that you prefer (e.g.,
  MM-YYYY, YYYY)?

  7. How detailed should the annotations be for the key data points (e.g., brief notes
  or comprehensive explanations)?

  8. Would you like a legend included to explain the different colors and markers
  used in the chart?

  9. Do you need any gridlines or background elements for better readability?

  10. Are there particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?'
