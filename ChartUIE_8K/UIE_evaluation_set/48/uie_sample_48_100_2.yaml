initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the "Producer Price Index
  (By Industry in $)" versus "No. of employed peoples in semiconductor industry."
  Highlight key data points to emphasize changes over time. Add text annotations to
  important points to draw attention to significant shifts in the Producer Price Index
  and employment. Use varying colors to differentiate between data points. This will
  help understand the industry's impact during the semiconductor shortage in the computers-and-technology
  context. Include additional context or editorial comments to provide insights on
  the trends and their practical implications.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the data
  points?

  2. Are there specific key data points or dates you would like to be highlighted?

  3. What information or labels would you like included in the text annotations for
  significant shifts?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the design or placement of the text annotations?

  5. Would you like any specific editorial comments or contextual information to be
  included on the chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s title and axis labels?

  7. Are there any specific trends or patterns you are particularly interested in
  emphasizing?

  8. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text annotations and
  labels?

  9. Would you like gridlines or other background elements included in the scatter
  plot?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the size or orientation of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Key data points could include dates and values where there were significant changes
  in the Producer Price Index or employment numbers.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include contextual information about the semiconductor shortage and
  how it impacted the industry.

  6. I prefer the title to be "Impact of Semiconductor Shortage on Producer Price
  Index and Employment". Axis labels could be "Producer Price Index (in $)" for the
  Y-axis and "Number of Employed People" for the X-axis.

  7. Emphasize any noticeable increase in Producer Price Index and its correlation
  with employment numbers during the semiconductor shortage.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  10. I do not have a specific preference.'
