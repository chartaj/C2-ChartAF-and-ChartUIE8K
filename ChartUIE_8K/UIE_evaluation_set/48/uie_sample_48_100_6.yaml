initial_prompt: Please create a line chart illustrating the trends over time using
  the data from the semiconductor industry. Specifically, I want to see the trends
  for the Producer Price Index, Export Price Index (End Use of semiconductors), Import
  Price Index, and the number of employed people in the semiconductor industry. Make
  sure the DATE is on the x-axis and the different indices and employment numbers
  are on the y-axis. This will help visualize the impact of semiconductor shortages
  on price indices and employment in the industry.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the axes have a logarithmic or linear scale?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  4. Do you prefer a particular line style (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) for differentiating
  the data series?

  5. Would you like to include data points markers on the lines?

  6. Should there be labels directly on the lines indicating the values at key points?

  7. How would you like the legend to be positioned (top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Do you want to add any annotations or text boxes to highlight significant events
  or trends?

  9. Is there a specific date range you would like to focus on?

  10. Should the y-axis have a shared scale for all indices and employment numbers,
  or separate scales?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Linear scale.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, include data points markers.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Right.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Shared scale.'
