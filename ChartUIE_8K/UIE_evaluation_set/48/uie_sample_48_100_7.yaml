initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize the semiconductor industry data
  from the file '48.csv'. The chart should display the 'Producer Price Index (By Industry
  in $)' over time, using the 'DATE' column as the x-axis. Additionally, overlay the
  'No. of employed peoples in semiconductor industry' on the same chart, utilizing
  a secondary y-axis. Highlight data gaps and missing values for better clarity. This
  will help understand trends and the impact of semiconductor shortages on employment
  and producer prices over time. Please ensure the chart is clear and informative,
  with appropriate labels and legends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the area chart and
  the secondary y-axis overlay?

  2. Are there specific labels or titles you would like on the x-axis, primary y-axis,
  and secondary y-axis?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for highlighting data gaps and missing values,
  such as using different colors or markers?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on both axes for better readability?
  If yes, should they be solid, dashed, or dotted?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels, legends,
  and titles?

  7. Do you want to include any annotations or markers for significant events or time
  periods within the data?

  8. Should the chart include tooltips or hover information to show exact values on
  the points of the chart?

  9. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  10. Do you have any preference for the thickness of the area filling and line plot
  in the overlay chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. X-axis: "Date", Primary y-axis: "Producer Price Index ($)", Secondary y-axis:
  "No. of Employed Peoples".

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, displaying gridlines would be helpful; they can be solid.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. YYYY-MM format would be fine for the x-axis labels.

  10. I am not sure.'
