initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the fluctuation of key indices related
  to the semiconductor industry over time. Highlight areas with missing data using
  different shades to draw attention. Include text annotations for crucial dates and
  data points like significant spikes in import/export price indexes and employment
  numbers. This visualization aims to understand the trends and issues relevant to
  the semiconductor shortage, facilitating better insight for stakeholders in the
  computers and technology sector. Ensure annotations provide context and highlight
  the importance of each element.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (font size, color, etc.)?

  3. Do you have specific dates or events that must be annotated?

  4. Should the heatmap highlight only the missing data, or do you want to differentiate
  between different types of missing data?

  5. How granular should the time axis be (days, months, years)?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  orientation)?

  7. Is there a specific way you''d like to group or categorize the indices on the
  heatmap?

  8. Would you like a legend to explain the different shades of missing data?

  9. Are there any specific indices you want to prioritize or highlight more prominently?

  10. Should the heatmap include any gridlines or borders for better readability?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, specific events like significant spikes in import/export price indexes and
  changes in employment numbers should be annotated.

  4. Highlight all missing data but differentiate between different types if possible.

  5. The time axis should be granular by months.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, a legend to explain the different shades of missing data would be useful.

  9. Prioritize import/export price indexes and employment numbers.

  10. Yes, please include gridlines or borders for better readability.'
