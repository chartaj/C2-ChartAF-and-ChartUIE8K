initial_prompt: I want to visualize the relationship between Product Price and Product
  Rating for Nykaa cosmetics products. Please create a scatter plot where the x-axis
  represents the Product Price and the y-axis represents the Product Rating. Different
  markers should be used for different Product Categories to distinguish them. This
  will help analyze if higher priced products generally have better ratings or if
  there is no significant correlation between price and rating. Ensure to label the
  axes and include a legend to identify the categories. Thank you!
questions: '1. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the markers representing different
  product categories?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot?

  4. Do you have specific axis ranges in mind for Product Price and Product Rating?

  5. What font style and size would you prefer for the axes labels and legend?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?

  7. Would you prefer any particular style or theme for the scatter plot (e.g., minimalist,
  vibrant)?

  8. Do you want any annotations for specific data points or categories in the plot?'
