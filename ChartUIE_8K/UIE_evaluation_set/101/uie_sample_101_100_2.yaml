initial_prompt: Visualize product prices across different markets using a Choropleth
  map. Highlight countries with higher average prices for beauty products. Annotate
  the top 3 countries with detailed product price data and category counts to emphasize
  price variations. This will help identify geographical pricing trends in the beauty
  industry. Additional data annotations can include the number of products reviewed
  in each country. Utilize the product price, market, and product reviews count columns
  from the dataset for the map and annotations. Focus on making geographical comparisons
  of product prices and their popularity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the Choropleth
  map?

  2. How would you like the countries with higher average prices to be highlighted
  (e.g., darker shades, specific colors)?

  3. Would you prefer the annotations for the top 3 countries to be placed on the
  map directly or in a side panel?

  4. What format do you prefer for displaying detailed product price data and category
  counts in annotations?

  5. Should the number of products reviewed be shown as a separate label or integrated
  within the annotations for each country?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to indicate different price ranges and review
  counts on the map?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds for "higher average prices" that you would
  like to set?

  8. Would you like to display market data for all countries or only those with significant
  data points?'
