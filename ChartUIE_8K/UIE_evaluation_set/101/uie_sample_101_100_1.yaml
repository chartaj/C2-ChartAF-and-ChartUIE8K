initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing product prices over different retailers
  from the provided dataset. Use the 'Product Price' for the Y-axis and 'Product Brand'
  as the X-axis. Highlight the highest and lowest prices with distinct colors. Annotate
  these points with their price values and product names. This chart aims to show
  price variation across brands and emphasize the most expensive and cheapest products.
  Additionally, use data-driven text annotations to display product ratings next to
  the price points to provide context on consumer perception relative to price.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  and positioning)?

  3. Should the line representing product prices be smooth or straight?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, do you have a preference for their
  style and color?

  5. Would you like the chart to have a title and, if so, what should the title be?

  6. Do you prefer any specific axis labels or styles for the X and Y axes?

  7. Should there be a legend on the chart, and if so, do you have a specific preference
  for its position and appearance?

  8. Is there a particular way you would like the highest and lowest prices to be
  highlighted (e.g., specific shapes or colors for markers)?

  9. Are there any additional labels or markers that you would like to include on
  the chart?'
