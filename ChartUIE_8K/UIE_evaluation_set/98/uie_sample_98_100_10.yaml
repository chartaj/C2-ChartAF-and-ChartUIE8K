initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap for my supermarket sales dataset. Specifically,
  I want to visualize the relationship between the Branch and City. The heatmap should
  show the count of transactions based on different branches (A, B, C) in various
  cities (Yangon, Naypyitaw, Mandalay). This will help in understanding which branches
  are recording more sales in which cities. Please use a color gradient that is easy
  to interpret, ranging from light (few transactions) to dark (many transactions).
  Ensure the heatmap is clear and labels for both axes are readable.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color gradient used in the
  heatmap?

  2. What font size do you prefer for the axis labels to ensure readability?

  3. Do you want to include any specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include annotations for the counts of transactions within
  each cell?

  5. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to have gridlines for better separation of cells?

  7. Would you like to have a legend or key explaining the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  8. Do you want the heatmap to be displayed in a specific orientation (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  9. Are there any specific aesthetic enhancements you prefer for the heatmap, such
  as borders, specific axis formats, or background color?

  10. Do you prefer to include any additional context or notes directly on the heatmap
  for the understanding of the prospective audience?'
