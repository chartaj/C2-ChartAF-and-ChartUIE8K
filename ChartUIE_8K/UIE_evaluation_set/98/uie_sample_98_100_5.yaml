initial_prompt: Hey, can you create a line chart for me using the dataset of supermarket
  sales? I want to visualize how the total sales amount fluctuates over time. Specifically,
  plot the "Date" on the x-axis and the "Total" sales on the y-axis. This will help
  me understand the sales trend over the given period. Please ensure the dates are
  sorted in chronological order, and make the chart easy to read with clear labels
  for both axes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific date format preference (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the line in the chart?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines to enhance readability?

  4. Should the chart include data points markers on the line?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Do you want to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  7. Are there specific intervals you would like for the x-axis labels (e.g., daily,
  weekly, monthly)?

  8. Would you like to add a trendline to the chart to highlight the overall trend?

  9. Should the y-axis start at zero, or would you prefer it to be auto-scaled based
  on the data range?

  10. Do you have any preference for the chart''s background color?'
