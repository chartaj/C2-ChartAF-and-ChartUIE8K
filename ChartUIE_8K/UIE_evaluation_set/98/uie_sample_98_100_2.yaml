initial_prompt: I need an area chart that shows the total sales over time for a supermarket
  business. Each area's color should represent different branches (A, B, C), and within
  each branch, differentiate between members and normal customers. Please highlight
  the points of highest sales with text annotations showing the exact total and the
  date. Additionally, use visual highlights to distinguish days with high ratings
  (greater than 9) by making those areas pop out in the chart. The purpose is to visualize
  sales trends and identify peak performance periods and their associated customer
  segments.
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for each branch (A, B, C) and customer
  type (members, normal customers)?

  2. Do you have any preference for the style or format of the text annotations for
  the highest sales points?

  3. How would you like the areas with high ratings (greater than 9) to be visually
  distinguished (e.g., different color, pattern, opacity)?

  4. What date format would you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  5. How granular do you want the time intervals to be on the x-axis (e.g., daily,
  weekly, monthly)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s overall color scheme or
  design style (e.g., minimalist, vibrant)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the branches and
  customer types?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or subtitle of the chart?'
