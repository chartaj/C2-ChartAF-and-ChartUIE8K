initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map to visualize the sales performance
  of our supermarket across different cities. Utilize the 'City', 'Total', and 'Branch'
  columns to represent these metrics geographically. The map should show which cities
  are generating higher sales by using varying shades, with darker shades indicating
  higher sales totals. Include interactive features so users can hover over each city
  to see detailed information such as sales total, branch, and customer type. Add
  a legend to make it easy to understand the different shades representing sales figures.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the varying shades representing
  different sales totals?

  2. Would you like the map to show sales performance per branch within each city
  or an overall total for all branches in a city?

  3. Is there a specific geographic level of detail you prefer (e.g., city boundaries,
  postal codes)?

  4. Would you like to include any additional data layers or annotations on the map
  apart from the sales performance?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the styling and positioning of the legend?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text elements on the map?

  7. Are there any specific cities or regions that you would like to highlight or
  focus on?'
