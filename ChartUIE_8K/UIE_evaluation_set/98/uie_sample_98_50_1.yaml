initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart to visualize total sales by product line.
  Highlight product lines with the highest and lowest total sales. Add annotations
  for significant outliers to draw attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting the highest and lowest total sales?

  2. Would you like specific shapes or markers for the lollipops representing each
  product line?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for easier comparison, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference for the annotations and labels on the
  chart?

  5. How detailed do you want the annotations for significant outliers to be? Should
  they include just the value, or also some context or comments?

  6. Would you like the product lines to be arranged in a specific order on the chart
  (e.g., ascending or descending by total sales)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would prefer a cleaner look without grid lines.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Just the value is fine for the annotations.
