initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart for the "Sales of a Supermarket" dataset. Plot
  the bubble chart using 'Product line' on the x-axis and 'City' on the y-axis. The
  size of the bubbles should represent 'Total' sales, and the color of the bubbles
  should indicate 'Gender'. This will help visualize how different products are performing
  in different cities and the gender composition of the customers making these purchases.
  Please make sure each bubble is labeled with the 'Customer type' to add more context.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for representing ''Gender''?

  2. Do you have a specific font preference for labeling the ''Customer type'' on
  the bubbles?

  3. Should the chart include a legend for ''Gender'' explicitly?

  4. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific order in which the ''Product line'' categories should be
  displayed on the x-axis?

  6. Do you have any preference for the axis labels design (e.g., bold, italics, color)?

  7. Should the bubbles have borders, and if so, what color and thickness would you
  prefer?

  8. Is there a particular size range you want for the bubbles (minimum and maximum
  size)?

  9. Would you like the chart to have a title and subtitles? If so, please specify
  the text and style.'
