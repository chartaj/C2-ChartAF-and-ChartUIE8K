initial_prompt: I want to visualize the sales data of the supermarket with a scatter
  plot. Please create a scatter plot where the x-axis represents the 'Quantity' of
  products sold and the y-axis represents the 'Total' sales amount. Additionally,
  use different colors to distinguish different 'Product line' categories. Include
  labels and a legend to make the plot clear. Moreover, differentiate the points based
  on 'Customer type' by using different markers or shapes. I'm interested in understanding
  the relationship between the quantity sold and the total sales, and how it varies
  across different product lines and customer types.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  product lines?

  2. Are there specific shapes or markers you prefer to use for different customer
  types?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart?

  4. What font style and size would you like for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the title of the chart?

  6. Would you like the axes to have specific ranges or should they be determined
  based on the data?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart?'
