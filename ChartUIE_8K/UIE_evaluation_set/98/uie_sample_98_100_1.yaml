initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart to visualize the total sales for each city
  within the supermarket dataset. Highlight the cities with the highest and lowest
  total sales to emphasize their significance. Annotate the specific sales values
  for these highlighted cities, focusing the viewer's attention on these data points.
  This will help to understand the distribution of sales across different locations
  and identify key areas of performance. Use different colors for each city to enhance
  visual distinction and to make the chart more intuitive and informative for business
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the cities in the chart?

  2. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the annotations?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitles? If so, do you have
  any specific text in mind?

  4. Do you prefer the sales values to be annotated inside the lollipop markers or
  adjacent to them?

  5. Should the lollipop stems have a specific width or style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the axis labels or grid lines in terms of style
  or visibility?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish the colors representing each
  city? If so, where should it be positioned?

  8. Is there any specific ordering of the cities you would like (e.g., alphabetical,
  ascending/descending by total sales)?'
