initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the distribution of possum
  populations. Highlight specific sites and annotate with data values like 'Pop',
  'sex', 'age', 'hdlngth', and 'totlngth'. Emphasize differences in these attributes
  per site. This is for a zoological regression study on possum demographics. Include
  annotations to highlight important data points and insights. Use color variations
  to represent different sites and populations, ensuring the most significant variations
  are visually prominent. The visualization should help in understanding possum distribution
  patterns and key demographic statistics across different geographical sites.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for representing different sites
  and populations?

  2. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., tooltips, labels, callouts)?

  3. Are there any specific geographical regions or sites you want to be highlighted
  more prominently?

  4. Do you prefer a particular color palette for the heatmap to emphasize variations
  effectively?

  5. How detailed do you want the annotations to be? Should they include all the data
  attributes or only the most significant ones?

  6. Are there any specific data points (outliers or key insights) that you already
  know should be highlighted?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to be overlaid on a specific type of map (e.g., satellite,
  terrain)?

  8. Are there any other graphical elements you would like included to enhance understanding
  (e.g., legends, scale bars)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I am not sure, but highlighting key areas with high possum populations could
  be useful.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Include only the most significant attributes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I don''t have a preference for the map type.

  8. Yes, please include legends and scale bars to enhance understanding.'
