initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize possum traits from the dataset. Highlight
  and annotate key values like `hdlngth`, `skullw`, and `totlngth` for different populations.
  Emphasize the differences in `footlgth` and `earconch` between sexes. This will
  help in understanding the distribution of physical characteristics among possum
  populations. Include text annotations for the maximum and minimum values in each
  highlighted category to draw attention to the variations. The chart will aid in
  better understanding zoological differences in possum characteristics for research
  and analysis. Make sure it's easy to compare the values visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between different
  populations and sexes?

  2. Should the bars be grouped or stacked to make comparison easier?

  3. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or subtitle?

  4. Do you have any preference for the positions of text annotations (e.g., above
  the bar, inside the bar)?

  5. Do you want gridlines or reference lines for better visual clarity?

  6. Should the chart include a specific font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for labels (e.g., horizontal, vertical, or angled)?

  8. Would you like to include legends for the populations and sexes? If so, any specific
  preference for their placement?'
