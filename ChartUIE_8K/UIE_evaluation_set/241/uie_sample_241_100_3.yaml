initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of baby names
  by their rank from the dataset. The x-axis should represent the rank of the names,
  and the y-axis should show the count of names that fall within each rank range.
  Use different colors to distinguish between different ethnicities, making it easy
  to compare name popularity across ethnic groups. The focus should be on the years
  covered in the dataset, highlighting how ranks of baby names vary over time. Tailor
  the visualization to reflect popular trends in baby names for both genders as described.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for distinguishing between
  different ethnicities?

  2. What range or specific bins would you prefer for the x-axis (rank) in the histogram?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the y-axis scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  4. Should the histogram display legends or labels in a particular format or location?

  5. Are there any specific years or time periods you want to be particularly highlighted
  in the visualization?

  6. Do you have preferences for the order or grouping of ethnicities on the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or markers to emphasize particular
  trends or notable data points?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  9. Do you want to apply any smoothing techniques or trend lines to the histogram
  to better reflect popular trends over time?

  10. Are there specific gender-related comparisons or breakdowns you want to highlight
  within the histogram?'
