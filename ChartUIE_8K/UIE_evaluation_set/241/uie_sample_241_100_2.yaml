initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of "Gender" and "Ethnicity"
  from the baby names dataset. Use text annotations to display the percentage of each
  segment. Highlight the largest segments in the chart. This chart aims to provide
  insight into the diversity of baby names based on gender and ethnicity. It will
  help understand trends and preferences in naming conventions across different demographics.
  Ensure that annotations are clear and that highlights effectively draw attention
  to significant data points. The chart should be visually appealing and informative.

  3. Do you prefer the text annotations to be inside the segments, outside, or connected
  with lines?

  4. What font style and size would you like for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like a legend included in the chart to indicate what each color/segment
  represents?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the segments to be arranged

  largest segments?'
