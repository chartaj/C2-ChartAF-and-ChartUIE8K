initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trends in baby names over the
  years based on the given data. The x-axis should represent the Year of Birth and
  the y-axis should represent the Rank of the baby names. Use different lines to represent
  different Ethnicities and further differentiate by Gender. We aim to identify popularity
  trends for various names across demographic groups. Title the chart "Trends in Popular
  Baby Names by Ethnicity and Gender." The chart should offer clear insight into how
  the popularity of certain names changes over time for different communities.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  differentiate between ethnicities and genders?

  2. Would you like the chart to include markers for each data point, or just the
  lines connecting the points?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify the different ethnicities and genders?

  4. Are there any specific ethnicities or genders you would like to highlight or
  emphasize in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer the y-axis (Rank) to be inverted so that Rank 1 is at the top of
  the chart, indicating higher popularity?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included for easier reference, and if so, should
  they be major grid lines, minor grid lines, or both?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or labels on the chart to mark significant
  trends or changes in popularity?

  8. Should the chart include axis labels with detailed descriptions, or will simple
  labels like ''Year'' and ''Rank'' suffice?

  9. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the chart titles
  and labels?

  10. Would you like to include any external reference lines, such as average rank
  over the years?'
