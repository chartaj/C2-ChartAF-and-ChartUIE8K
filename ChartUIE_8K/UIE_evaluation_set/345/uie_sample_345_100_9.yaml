initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique job titles
  mentioned in the Internshala Jobs Dataset related to "data-science-and-analytics."
  The chart should display the proportion of different job titles such as "WordPress
  Development Intern" and "ERPNext And HRMS Admin Intern," among others. Each slice
  of the pie should represent a job title, and the size should correspond to the number
  of unique occurrences of that job title. This will help understand the variety and
  frequency of job titles in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the pie chart?

  2. Should the chart include a legend indicating the job titles corresponding to
  each slice?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size for the text
  in the chart?

  4. Would you like the percentages to be displayed within the slices of the pie chart?

  5. Do you want the chart title to be included, and if so, what should it be?

  6. Should the chart include labels for each slice with the job title and the number
  of occurrences?

  7. Do you prefer a 2D or 3D style for the pie chart?

  descending order of frequency)?'
