initial_prompt: I'd like to create a stacked bar chart using the Internshala Jobs
  Dataset. The chart should display the 'JobTitles' on the X-axis and stack 'Skills'
  within these job titles. I'd like to see how different skills contribute to various
  job roles. The Y-axis should represent the count of each skill within a job title.
  This visualization can help understand the demand for different skills in job roles.
  Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret with a legend. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the stacked bars?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size for the axis
  labels?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines or not?

  4. Do you have any preference for the chart title and subtitle?

  5. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Are there any specific colors you would like to avoid in the chart?

  7. Do you want the X-axis labels to be rotated for better readability?

  8. Would you prefer the bars to be of a specific width or accept the default width?

  9. Is there any specific order in which you want the job titles to be displayed
  on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by count)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the format of the Y-axis labels (e.g., plain
  numbers, percentages)?'
