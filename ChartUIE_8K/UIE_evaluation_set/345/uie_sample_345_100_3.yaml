initial_prompt: Create a spline chart to visualize the distribution of unique values
  across different columns in the Internshala Jobs Dataset. The x-axis should represent
  the column names (Company_Name, JobTitles, Skills, Description, Stipend, Links)
  and the y-axis should indicate the number of unique values for each column. This
  will help us understand which columns have the most variation, providing insights
  into the dataset's diversity in job postings, skills required, and other attributes.
  Use data from the given formats to ensure comprehensive coverage.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color scheme for the spline chart?

  2. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, please provide the desired
  title.

  3. Should the chart include labels for each data point on the spline?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Would you like to add legends to the chart?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  7. Do you prefer markers on the spline to emphasize each unique value point? If
  yes, any specific marker style?

  8. Should the chart include annotations or notes for significant data points?

  9. Do you have preferences for the chart''s background color or style?

  10. Would you like to display the exact number of unique values next to or on each
  data point on the spline?'
