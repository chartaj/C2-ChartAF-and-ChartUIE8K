initial_prompt: I have a dataset from the Internshala Jobs Dataset focusing on data
  science and analytics internships. I'd like to create a density plot to visualize
  the distribution of stipends offered for different internships. The key columns
  we need are 'Company_Name', 'JobTitles', and 'Stipend'. The plot should show the
  density of stipends across various internships to understand the common stipend
  range. Can you generate this density plot?
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the density plot?

  2. Do you want to differentiate stipends by ''JobTitles'' or ''Company_Name'' using
  color or shading?

  3. What labels or titles would you like on the axes?

  4. Would you prefer the plot to include a legend?

  5. Should the density plot include grid lines for better readability?

  6. What specific range of stipends are you most interested in?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Differentiate stipends by ''JobTitles'' using color.

  3. X-axis: "Stipend", Y-axis: "Density"

  4. Yes, include a legend.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.'
data_attributes:
- Company_Name
- JobTitles
- Stipend
