initial_prompt: I want to visualize internship opportunities based on the stipend
  offered and the number of skills required. Create a bubble chart where the x-axis
  represents different companies, and the y-axis represents the stipend amount. The
  size of the bubble should indicate the number of skills required for each role.
  Use different colors to distinguish job titles. This will help identify which companies
  offer higher stipends and the skill requirements for their internships. Ensure that
  the legend clearly differentiates job titles, and the chart is easy to read and
  interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing job titles?

  2. Do you want the companies on the x-axis sorted in any particular order?

  3. Would you prefer the y-axis (stipend amount) to be in specific currency formatting?

  4. Do you have any particular font style or size preferences for the chart labels?

  5. Should the bubbles have any specific opacity level for better readability?

  6. Do you need axis titles or additional annotations in the chart for better clarity?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the chart to help with interpreting data?

  8. Should there be a tooltip feature to display detailed information when hovering
  over bubbles?'
