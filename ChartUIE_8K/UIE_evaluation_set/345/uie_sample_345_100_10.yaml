initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the number of unique values in
  each column of the dataset titled "Internshala Jobs Dataset" from the data-science-and-analytics
  category. The x-axis should represent the column names (Company_Name, JobTitles,
  Skills, Description, Stipend, Links), and the y-axis should depict the count of
  unique values. Each bar group will distinguish the different columns, highlighting
  the diversity within each data field. Please ensure the chart is color-coded for
  clarity and includes labels for both axes and a legend to make understanding easier.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors that should
  be used for the bars?

  2. Do you have a preferred style for the bar edges (e.g., solid, dashed, no border)?

  3. Should the y-axis use a specific scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic), or should
  it be automatically scaled based on the data?

  4. Is there a particular font style and size you prefer for the axis labels, legend,
  and title?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability, and
  if so, should they be styled in a particular way?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the spacing or width of the bars within
  each group?

  7. Should the legend be positioned in a particular location on the chart (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or data labels directly on the bars to show
  the exact count of unique values?

  9. Is there a preferred background color or texture for the chart overall?

  10. Would you like to see any additional information or notes included on the chart
  (e.g., source of data, date of dataset)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette or specific colors.

  2. I have no specific preference for the bar edges.

  3. The y-axis can be automatically scaled based on the data.

  4. I am not sure about the font style and size; default settings should be fine.

  5. Including gridlines would be helpful for readability, but I have no preference
  for their style.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the spacing or width of the bars.

  7. The legend can be positioned where it fits best.

  8. Including data labels directly on the bars to show the exact count would be useful.

  9. I have no specific preference for the background color or texture.

  10. I do not know if additional information or notes are necessary.'
