initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualizing the relationship between different job
  titles and the skills required for those positions from the Internshala Jobs Dataset.
  The x-axis should represent JobTitles while the y-axis should represent Skills.
  Each cell in the heatmap should indicate how frequently each skill is associated
  with each job title, with a color gradient to show intensity. This will help quickly
  identify which skills are most common for specific roles, providing valuable insights
  for both job seekers to understand skill demand and companies to tailor their job
  descriptions accordingly. Include data summary annotations to highlight key findings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or gradient for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the color intensity to be scaled? For example, logarithmic
  scale or linear scale?

  3. Do you want specific annotations or highlights for the most frequent skills or
  job titles?

  4. Is there a particular font style and size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  5. Should the data summary annotations highlight the top skills per job title, overall
  most frequent skills, or another specific metric?

  6. Do you have a preference for how the grid lines in the heatmap should be displayed
  or styled?

  7. Would you like the heatmap to include tooltips or labels displaying the actual
  frequency values when hovered or clicked?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Linear scale should be fine.

  3. Yes, I would like specific annotations for the most frequent skills.

  4. I do not know.

  5. The data summary annotations should highlight the top skills per job title.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
