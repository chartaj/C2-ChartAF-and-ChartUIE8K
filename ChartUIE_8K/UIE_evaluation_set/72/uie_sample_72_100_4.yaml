initial_prompt: I am working on a data project about global terrorism incidents. Specifically,
  I want to visualize the number of terrorist attacks per year for different countries.
  I've provided a data sample showing columns for Entity, Code, Year, and Terrorist
  attacks. Could you please create a bar chart that displays the total number of terrorist
  attacks for each year, combining all countries? Make sure the x-axis represents
  the years, and the y-axis represents the total number of terrorist attacks. This
  will help me understand the trends in terrorist activity over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be of a certain width or spacing?

  4. Should the chart include a title and axis labels, if so, do you have specific
  text in mind?

  5. Do you want to display data labels on the bars to show exact numbers of attacks?

  6. Would you like to include a legend even if the data consists of a single category?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  8. Should we include annotations or highlight specific years that are significant?

  9. Do you prefer a vertical bar chart or a horizontal bar chart?'
