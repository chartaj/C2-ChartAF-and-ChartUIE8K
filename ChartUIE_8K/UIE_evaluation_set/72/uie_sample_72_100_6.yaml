initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the number of terrorist attacks
  per year globally. The x-axis should represent the years ranging from 1970 to the
  latest available year, and the y-axis should show the number of terrorist attacks.
  Make sure to highlight any years with missing data in the "Code" field and ensure
  they are clearly marked or treated. Use distinct colors to differentiate between
  years with complete data and those with missing values in the "Code" field to easily
  identify any gaps or anomalies in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between years
  with complete data and those with missing values in the "Code" field?

  2. Would you like to add any specific annotations or labels to highlight particular
  years or data points in the histogram?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the bin width or the number of bins in the histogram?

  4. Should the x-axis labels display every year, or would you prefer a specific interval
  (e.g., every 5 or 10 years) for better readability?

  5. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like to use for the titles
  and labels on the axes?

  6. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding used for years with
  complete data versus those with missing values?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about adding specific annotations or labels.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Displaying the x-axis labels at specific intervals, like every 5 years, would
  be preferable for better readability.

  5. I do not have any preferences for the font styles or sizes.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding used for years with
  complete data versus those with missing values.'
