  Create a heatmap visualizing the number of terrorist attacks over the years across
  different countries. Highlight countries with no missing ''Code'' values. Annotate
  the cells with the highest and lowest attack numbers to focus attention on outliers.
  This will help in understanding global and temporal patterns in terrorist activities.
  The chart will be useful for data-driven analysis in the context of terrorism worldwide.
