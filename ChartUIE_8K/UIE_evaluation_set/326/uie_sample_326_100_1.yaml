initial_prompt: Create a treemap to showcase the distribution of different technologies
  used by domains in the dataset. Each rectangle represents a website domain, and
  within it, sub-rectangles represent the technologies. Use colors to differentiate
  between technologies. Include annotations highlighting key points such as the most
  common technology and domains with the highest number of technologies. The purpose
  of this chart is to help visualize the concentration and diversity of technologies
  across different domains, aiding in the analysis of technology adoption trends in
  US businesses.
