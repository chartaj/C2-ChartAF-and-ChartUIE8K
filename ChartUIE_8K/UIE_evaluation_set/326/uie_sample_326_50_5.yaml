initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the frequency of different technologies used
  (Technology Name) across various website domains (Website Domain) within the given
  timeframe (First Seen At to Last Seen At). Color intensity should indicate the technology
  adoption rate.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity follow a linear, logarithmic, or any other specific
  scale?

  3. Do you want any specific labels on the axes, such as shortened domain names or
  technology names?

  4. How would you prefer to handle missing or incomplete data points?

  5. Should the timeframe be broken down into specific intervals (e.g., by month,
  quarter)?

  6. Do you need any annotations or additional markers on the heatmap?

  7. What is the desired level of detail for the data points (e.g., exact counts,
  percentage)?

  8. Is there a specific way you''d like to order the website domains or technologies
  (e.g., alphabetically, by frequency, by category)?

  9. Do you require a legend or key to explain the color intensities used?

  10. Would you prefer to see any reference lines or grids for better readability?'
