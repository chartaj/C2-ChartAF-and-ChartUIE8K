initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that shows the timeline of when different
  technologies were first and last seen across various website domains. Use the "First
  Seen At" and "Last Seen At" dates on the x-axis, and "Website Domain" categories
  on the y-axis. It would be great if the chart can clearly differentiate between
  "First Seen At" and "Last Seen At" with different colors or markers. Additionally,
  include a legend that shows the different technology names for better clarity. This
  visualization will help us track the technology adoption and duration on each website.
  Thank you!
