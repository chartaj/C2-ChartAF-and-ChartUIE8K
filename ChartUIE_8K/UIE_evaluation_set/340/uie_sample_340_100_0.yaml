initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the 'Order Quantity' distribution
  across different 'Order Dates' from the supply-chain-management data. Annotate key
  order quantities to draw attention to significant data points. Highlight the bins
  with the highest order quantities for better comparison. Include text annotations
  for the top 3 maximum order quantities to provide additional insight. Use varying
  colors to distinguish different ranges of order quantities. This will help in comprehensively
  analyzing supply chain order trends over time and identifying any anomalies or peaks
  in the data. Include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing different ranges
  of order quantities?

  2. Should the annotation text for significant data points include just the quantity
  or additional information such as the date?

  3. Is there a specific way you would like the bins with the highest order quantities
  to be highlighted (e.g., bold borders, specific colors)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font or style for the text annotations on the chart?

  5. How many bins would you prefer for the histogram to provide the most meaningful
  distribution?

  6. Are there any specific dates or order quantities you are particularly interested
  in highlighting or annotating?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; please choose one that clearly
  distinguishes the ranges.

  2. I am not sure; including just the quantity is okay.

  3. Bold borders would be a good way to highlight the bins with the highest order
  quantities.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the font or style.

  5. I do not know; please choose the optimal number of bins for meaningful distribution.

  6. I am particularly interested in highlighting the top 3 maximum order quantities
  with annotations.'
