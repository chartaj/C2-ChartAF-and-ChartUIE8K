initial_prompt: I want to create a line chart to visualize the time taken for order
  delivery in our supply chain process. Use data from the OrderDate, ShipDate, and
  DeliveryDate columns to plot the timeline of orders. The x-axis should show the
  different order stages (OrderDate, ShipDate, DeliveryDate), and the y-axis should
  represent the dates. Different lines for each Sales Channel will also help in comparing
  delivery times across channels like In-Store, Online, and Distributor. This visualization
  will help identify inefficiencies in the supply chain management process.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the sales
  channels?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the line chart for specific points,
  such as exact dates for OrderDate, ShipDate, and DeliveryDate?

  3. Should we include a legend to identify the different sales channels?

  4. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for the different sales
  channels?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart to make it easier to read the dates?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to emphasize
  certain data points or trends?'
