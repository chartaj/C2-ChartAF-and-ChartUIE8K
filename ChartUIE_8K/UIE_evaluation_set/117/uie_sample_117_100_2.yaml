initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the provided apple quality data. Plot
  'Sweetness' on the x-axis and 'Crunchiness' on the y-axis. Use different colors
  to indicate 'Quality' (good or bad). Highlight data points with a 'Sweetness' value
  greater than 5. Include text annotations for the first three data points to display
  their 'A_id', 'Sweetness', and 'Crunchiness'. The purpose is to visually analyze
  the relationship between 'Sweetness', 'Crunchiness', and overall 'Quality'. This
  visualization helps identifying trends or patterns in apple qualities for food and
  drink analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used to indicate
  ''Quality'' (good or bad)?

  2. What style would you prefer for highlighting the data points with a ''Sweetness''
  value greater than 5 (e.g., different color, size, shape)?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the text annotations (font size, font
  color, placement, etc.) for the first three data points?

  4. What titles and labels would you like to use for the x-axis (Sweetness) and y-axis
  (Crunchiness)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend describing the ''Quality'' categories and
  highlighted data points? If yes, do you have a preference for its placement on the
  chart?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines in the scatter plot? If so, do you have any
  preference on their appearance (color, style, etc.)?

  7. Is there any specific chart size or aspect ratio you prefer for the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any additional elements or features you would like to include in the
  chart to make it more effective for your analysis?'
