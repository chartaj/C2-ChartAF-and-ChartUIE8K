  Create a line chart visualizing the quality of apples over various attributes such
  as Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, and Acidity. Highlight
  elements with different colors or markers to distinguish between good and bad qualities.
  Text annotations should display specific values at key points to draw attention.
  The purpose is to easily compare and analyze the correlation between these attributes
  and the overall quality of apples. Practical use includes identifying which attributes
  most affect quality to improve apple selection.
