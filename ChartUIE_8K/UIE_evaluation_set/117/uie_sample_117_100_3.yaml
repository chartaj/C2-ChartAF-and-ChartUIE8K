initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart for the 'Apple Quality' dataset. The chart
  should represent 'Quality' on the x-axis and stack the columns based on 'Ripeness',
  'Sweetness', 'Crunchiness', and 'Juiciness'. This way, we can see how these attributes
  contribute to the overall apple quality. Ensure the bars are clearly color-coded
  for each attribute and add a legend for clarity. Also, include the count of 'Quality'
  categories ('good' and 'bad'). Title the chart "Contribution of Attributes to Apple
  Quality". This visualization will help in comparing the different factors affecting
  apple quality.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the different attributes
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for ''Ripeness'', ''Sweetness'', ''Crunchiness'',
  and ''Juiciness''?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart title and labels?

  4. Would you like to display data labels on each segment of the stack?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the attributes to be stacked?

  6. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the stacked bar chart?

  7. Should the counts of ''Quality'' categories (''good'' and ''bad'') be displayed
  inside the bars or beside them?

  8. Are there any specific markers or notations you would like added to the legend
  or axes?

  9. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  10. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?
  If so, should they be major gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?'
