initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the Apple Quality data. Plot
  the average values for Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness,
  and Acidity. Separate the bars in the chart by the Quality categories ('good' and
  'bad') to compare the differences. Ensure the chart also addresses the missing values
  appropriately, either excluding or imputing them in the analysis. This comparison
  will help us understand the characteristics that distinguish high-quality apples
  from lower-quality ones in terms of physical and sensory attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing ''good''
  and ''bad'' quality apples?

  2. Would you like the chart to display the exact average values on top of each bar?

  3. Should the bars be clustered or stacked for each quality category?

  4. Do you have a preference for the handling of missing values (e.g., imputation
  method)?

  5. What labels or titles would you like for the x-axis, y-axis, and the overall
  chart?

  6. Would you prefer the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you want any specific font style or size for the chart elements, such as labels
  and titles?

  8. Should there be a legend distinguishing the ''good'' and ''bad'' categories,
  even though they are on separate bars?

  9. Is there a specific ordering for the attributes on the x-axis that you prefer?

  10. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?

  11. Would you like any additional notes or annotations on the chart to highlight
  key points?'
