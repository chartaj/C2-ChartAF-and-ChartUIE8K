initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of "Raw TOC
  (mg/l)" and "Finish TOC (mg/l)" data. Ensure to label the axes appropriately. The
  box plot should highlight the range, median, and possible outliers for these measurements.
  This will help us understand the variability in total organic carbon levels and
  the effectiveness of the treatment process in reducing it. The data detail context
  is environmental science focusing on organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon
  levels. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box plots?

  2. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  3. Do you prefer grid lines on the background of the box plot for better readability?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to display individual data points or just the summary statistics
  in the box plot?

  6. Should the box plots be oriented horizontally or vertically?

  7. Do you prefer to include a legend to differentiate between ''Raw TOC (mg/l)''
  and ''Finish TOC (mg/l)''?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or scales you would like to use for the axes?

  9. Would you like any annotations or additional markers on the chart to highlight
  specific data points or important values?

  10. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the box plot lines and whiskers?'
