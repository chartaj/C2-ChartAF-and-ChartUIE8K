initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of ''Raw TOC (mg/l)''
  and ''Finish TOC (mg/l)''. Add text annotations to highlight key data points and
  utilize highlights for emphasis. Purpose: environmental monitoring.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting key data
  points?

  2. Would you like the histogram bins to be of equal width, or should they reflect
  the data distribution more dynamically?

  3. Are there any specific value ranges you want us to focus on with annotations?

  4. Should we include a legend to differentiate between ''Raw TOC (mg/l)'' and ''Finish
  TOC (mg/l)''?

  5. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should we apply any specific statistical measures (e.g., mean or median lines)
  on the histogram?

  8. Are there any additional visual elements you would like to include (e.g., gridlines,
  reference lines)?

  9. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., vertical
  vs. horizontal)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional contextual information (e.g., data
  collection dates or environmental events)?'
