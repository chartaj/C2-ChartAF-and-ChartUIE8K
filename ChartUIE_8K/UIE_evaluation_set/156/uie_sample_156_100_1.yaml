initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of students' 'Curricular
  units 1st sem (grade)' for dropout and graduate statuses. Include data-driven annotations
  to highlight the mean grade for each status. The purpose of this visualization is
  to analyze how students' grades in the first semester correlate with their chances
  of graduating or dropping out. Highlight significant grade differences between the
  two statuses to guide educational interventions. The chart will help educators identify
  patterns and areas that need attention to improve student success rates.
questions: "1. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing between dropout\
  \ and graduate statuses? \n2. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in\
  \ the histogram?\n3. Do you want grid lines to be included in the histogram for\
  \ better clarity?\n4. Should the histogram bars be displayed as solid or have a\
  \ border outline?\n5. Do you prefer the mean grades to be annotated as lines, markers,\
  \ or numeric labels on the histogram?\n6. Is there a specific font style and size\
  \ you prefer for the labels and annotations?\n7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have\
  \ specific titles or labels?\n8. How would you like to display the legend (e.g.,\
  \ top, bottom, left, right)?\n9. Would you prefer the histogram to be horizontal\
  \ or vertical?\n10. Do you have any specific requirements or preferences for the\
  \ histogram's overall size or aspect ratio?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, maybe something simple like blue
  for graduates and red for dropouts.

  2. I don''t know, maybe you could choose a common or standard number of bins?

  3. Yes, please include grid lines for better clarity.

  4. Solid bars would be good.

  5. I think numeric labels on the histogram would work best for annotating the mean
  grades.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the font style and size.

  7. Yes, the x-axis could be labeled ''1st Sem Grade'' and the y-axis ''Number of
  Students''.

  8. No specific preference for the legend placement.

  9. I prefer the histogram to be vertical.

  10. I have no specific requirements for the overall size or aspect ratio.'
