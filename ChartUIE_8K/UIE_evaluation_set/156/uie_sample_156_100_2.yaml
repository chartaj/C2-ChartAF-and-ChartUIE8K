initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the count of students for each combination
  of "Marital status" and "Course". Use different colors for each "Marital status"
  to differentiate them. Highlight the bars representing the highest and lowest counts.
  Add text annotations to display the exact count values on these highlighted bars.
  The chart will help visualize the distribution of students across different courses
  and marital statuses, aiding in understanding any correlations or trends. This could
  provide insights into how marital status might influence course selection or success
  in different academic programs.
