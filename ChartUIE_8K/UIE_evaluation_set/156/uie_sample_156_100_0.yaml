initial_prompt: I would like a stacked bar chart that visualizes the "Curricular units
  1st sem (approved)" and "Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)" against the "Course"
  for each "Marital status" category. Use text annotations to highlight the total
  number of approved units for each course and highlight any significant differences
  between the semesters. This visualization will help analyze dropout rates and graduation
  success based on the number of curricular units approved per course and marital
  status. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret with a clear legend and labeled axes.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different "Marital status" categories?

  2. Would you prefer specific colors for "Curricular units 1st sem (approved)" and
  "Curricular units 2nd sem (approved)"?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or format for the text annotations highlighting
  the total number of approved units?

  4. How would you like significant differences between the semesters to be highlighted?

  5. Do you have specific preferences for the positioning of the legend?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the labels
  and legend?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart background? If so, do you
  have a preference for their style or color?

  8. Is there any particular order you would like the "Course" categories to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  9. Do you have preferences for the range or intervals used on the y-axis?

  10. Are there any additional labels or information you would like to include in
  the chart?'
