initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to analyze student success based on their curricular
  unit performance. Use "Age at enrollment" as the X-axis and "Curricular units 1st
  sem (grade)" and "Curricular units 2nd sem (grade)" as the Y-axes. Differentiate
  points by student outcome ("Dropout" or "Graduate") using color coding. This will
  help visualize any correlation between age and academic performance, and how it
  impacts student success or dropout rates. Ensure the plot is clear and includes
  a legend for outcome categories.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the "Dropout" and "Graduate" categories?

  2. Would you like to use different marker shapes for "Dropout" and "Graduate" for
  additional differentiation?

  3. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the scatter plot?

  4. Do you want to label the axes with specific titles or leave them with the data
  attribute names?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the range or scaling of the axes?

  7. Would you prefer any grid lines or background styling for better readability
  of the scatter plot?

  8. Do you want to include any additional information or annotations on the chart,
  such as average performance lines or trend lines?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Label the axes with specific titles.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. I am not sure.'
