initial_prompt: I want to visualize the cardiac health data for patients using a dot
  plot. Can you create a dot plot where each dot represents an individual patient?
  On the x-axis, let's have the 'age' of patients, and on the y-axis, let's display
  'serumcholestrol' levels. Dots should be color-coded by 'gender' and sized by 'chestpain'
  levels. This way, I can see the relationship between age, cholesterol levels, gender,
  and chest pain.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing the ''gender''
  attribute?

  2. What range of dot sizes would you like to use for representing ''chestpain''
  levels?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the axes?

  4. Do you have a preference for the background or gridline style for the plot?

  5. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color-coding and sizing, and if
  so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Should there be any additional titles or subtitles on the chart?

  7. Do you want to display any trend lines or regression lines on the dot plot?

  8. Are there specific age or cholesterol level ranges you would like to focus on
  or highlight in the plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette for representing
  the ''gender'' attribute.

  2. I am not sure about the range of dot sizes for ''chestpain'' levels.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for labels or annotations on the axes.

  4. I am not sure about the background or gridline style for the plot.

  5. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color-coding and sizing, positioned
  at the bottom right of the plot.

  6. I do not know if any additional titles or subtitles are needed.

  7. No, I do not want to display any trend lines or regression lines on the dot plot.

  8. No, focus on the entire range of age and cholesterol levels.'
