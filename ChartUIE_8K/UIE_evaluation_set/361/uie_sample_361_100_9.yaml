initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the cardiovascular disease dataset,
  focusing on different age groups and their corresponding resting blood pressure
  levels. The data should be categorized by gender and chest pain type. This will
  help understand the distribution of blood pressure readings across various age brackets,
  and how these factors interplay with cardiovascular health risks. The chart should
  include age on the x-axis and resting blood pressure on the y-axis, with separate
  box plots for each gender and chest pain category. Highlight any significant outliers
  or trends, particularly in relation to the target variable.
questions: '1. What color schemes do you prefer for distinguishing between genders
  and chest pain types in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the box plots (e.g., traditional, with notches)?

  4. Should the age groups be evenly split, or do you have specific age brackets in
  mind?

  5. Would you like to display the actual data points on the box plots to identify
  individual readings?

  6. Should outliers be color-coded or highlighted in a specific manner?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labels or annotations for trends and significant findings?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to include a legend or a description box to explain the chart
  elements?'
