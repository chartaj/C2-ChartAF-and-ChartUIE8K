initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to cardiovascular health containing information
  like 'age', 'gender', 'chest pain type', 'resting blood pressure', 'serum cholesterol',
  and others. I need to visualize comparisons between different genders regarding
  'chest pain type' and 'target' results using a grouped bar chart. Each group should
  represent a different gender, with bars showing counts for each chest pain type
  and target result. This will help to analyze gender differences in the types of
  chest pain and cardiovascular disease outcomes. Please ensure the chart is clear
  and well-labeled. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the different
  genders and chest pain types?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style and size for the labels and titles on the
  chart?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the chest pain types
  and target results?

  4. Are there any specific titles or captions you would like to add to the chart
  or its axes?

  5. Do you prefer a particular orientation for the chart (horizontal or vertical
  bars)?

  6. Would you like to include data values on top of each bar for more precise information?

  7. Is there a need for grid lines or any background shading to enhance readability?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between the chest pain types and
  target results.

  4. The title can be "Comparison of Chest Pain Types and Cardiovascular Outcomes
  by Gender". For the axes, you can use "Gender" for the x-axis and "Count" for the
  y-axis.

  5. Vertical bars are preferable.

  6. Yes, including data values on top of each bar would be helpful for precise information.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
