initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset.
  The X-axis should represent patient ages, while the Y-axis will show the max heart
  rates. Ensure to differentiate between male and female patients using different
  colored lines. This will help us understand the trend in maximum heart rate across
  different ages and observe if there's a distinction between genders. Additionally,
  include a legend to easily identify the lines. The chart should provide a clear
  visualization of how max heart rate varies with age among different genders in our
  dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating male and female
  patients?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the X-axis (age) and Y-axis (max heart rate)
  labels or their font sizes?

  4. Should the axis labels include units (e.g., ''Age (years)'', ''Max Heart Rate
  (bpm)'')?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  6. Are there specific age ranges you would like to focus on or highlight within
  the chart?

  7. Do you prefer any specific styles or themes for the chart to match your presentation
  format?'
