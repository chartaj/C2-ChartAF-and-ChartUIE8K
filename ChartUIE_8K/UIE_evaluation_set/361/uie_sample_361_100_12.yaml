initial_prompt: I have a dataset on cardiovascular disease with various patient details
  like age, gender, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, etc. I'd like to visualize
  this data in a Marimekko chart to understand the distribution and relationships
  among different variables like age groups, cholesterol levels, and chest pain types.
  Please color-code different categories for easy comprehension, and make sure the
  proportions of each category are accurately represented. Please ensure that the
  chart is clear and easy to understand for someone without any technical background.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different categories?

  2. Do you want specific age groups or a custom age segmentation (e.g., 0-20, 21-40,
  41-60, 61+)?

  3. Should we include a legend to explain the color codes?

  4. Do you need any specific labels on the chart for easier comprehension?

  5. Would you prefer any specific series order (e.g., age groups displayed before
  cholesterol levels)?

  6. Should the chart include a title or description for context? If yes, what should
  it say?

  7. Do you have a preferred font size or style for the chart text to ensure clarity?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme, please use colors that are easy
  to distinguish.

  2. I am not sure about the age groups; please use what you think is best.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color codes.

  4. I do not have any specific labels in mind; just make sure it''s easy to comprehend.

  5. I am not sure about the series order, please choose the most logical one.

  6. Yes, please include a title: "Distribution of Cardiovascular Disease Variables".

  7. I do not have a preferred font size or style; just ensure it is clear and readable.'
