initial_prompt: Please create small multiples charts for the Cardiovascular Disease
  Dataset. Each chart should visualize a single patient's data, comparing 'age', 'chestpain',
  'restingBP', 'serumcholestrol', 'fastingbloodsugar', and 'target'. Use different
  colors to distinguish between these variables. Chart titles should include the patient
  ID. This way, we can easily compare how each factor varies across different patients,
  helping to identify patterns or anomalies related to cardiovascular health. Show
  sample data for three patients as separate charts, ensuring the layout is visually
  clear and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred chart type for representing each patient''s
  data (e.g., bar chart, line chart, etc.)?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing between the different variables?

  3. Is there a specific order you want the variables to be displayed in the charts
  (e.g., by importance or chronological order)?

  4. How do you want the axes to be labeled and scaled for each patient''s chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the size and layout of the charts to ensure they
  are visually clear and informative?

  6. Should there be any annotations or additional information displayed on the charts
  (e.g., average values, standard deviations, etc.)?

  7. Would you like to include legends in each chart or have a separate legend for
  all charts?

  8. How should anomalies or significant patterns in the data be highlighted within
  the charts?'
answers: "1. I am not sure.\n2. I do not know.\n3. I have no specific preference.\n\
  4. Age should be on the x-axis, and the other variables can be plotted with different\
  \ y-axis scales. \n5. I don't have a specific preference for size, but they should\
  \ be clear and fit well on a single view.\n6. I do not need any annotations.\n7.\
  \ A separate legend for all charts would be fine.\n8. I am not sure."
