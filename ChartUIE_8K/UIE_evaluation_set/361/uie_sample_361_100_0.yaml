initial_prompt: 'Create a radar chart using the Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset to
  visualize patient health metrics: age, gender, chestpain, restingBP, serumcholestrol,
  fastingbloodsugar, restingrelectro, maxheartrate, exerciseangia, oldpeak, slope,
  noofmajorvessels, and target. Highlight key features and outliers in the data. Include
  text annotations for unique patient cases to provide context and focus on specific
  metrics. The purpose is to understand the spread of these health parameters across
  patients and identify trends or significant deviations that might indicate risk
  factors for cardiovascular diseases.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting key features
  and outliers?

  2. Are there specific health metrics you would like to focus on more prominently
  in the radar chart?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be displayed for unique patient cases
  (e.g., placement, font size)?

  4. Would you like to group patients by certain categories (e.g., target, gender)
  on the radar chart?

  5. Are there any specific threshold values for the health metrics that should be
  used to identify extreme values or outliers?

  6. Do you prefer a specific design or format for the radar chart (e.g., number of
  axes, data normalization)?

  7. Should the radar chart include a legend or labels for reference?

  8. Are there any specific patients or cases that you would like highlighted or annotated
  in more detail?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a preferred color scheme.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the text annotations to be clear and readable, perhaps with a moderate
  font size.

  4. Yes, please group patients by target categories.

  5. I am not sure about specific threshold values.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the radar chart should include a legend or labels for reference.

  8. I do not have specific patients or cases in mind for detailed highlighting.'
