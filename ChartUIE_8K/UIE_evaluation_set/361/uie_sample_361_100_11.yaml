initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset data using
  a heatmap. Specifically, I want to see the correlation between the different columns
  such as age, gender, chestpain, restingBP, serumcholestrol, fastingbloodsugar, etc.
  Highlight significant relationships, especially focusing on the 'target' column
  to identify risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The heatmap should be color-coded
  for easy interpretation, with legend and axis labels. Ensure that missing values
  are addressed and that the data types are correctly handled, particularly for numeric
  values. This visualization will help in understanding how different variables correlate
  with heart disease.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. How do you prefer significant relationships to be highlighted (e.g., through
  specific color intensities, annotations)?

  3. What threshold for correlation coefficients would you consider as significant?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the heatmap (e.g., dimensions in pixels)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations on the heatmap?

  6. Is there any particular way you want the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., font
  size, style)?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to display all possible correlations or only selected
  ones?

  8. Should the heatmap also include the actual numeric correlation values within
  each cell?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Through specific color intensities.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Display all possible correlations.

  8. Yes, include the actual numeric correlation values within each cell.'
