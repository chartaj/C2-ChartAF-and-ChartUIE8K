initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset displaying
  the relationship between age (x-axis) and maxheartrate (y-axis). Use text annotations
  to highlight specific patients, specifically those with restingBP above 140 or serumcholestrol
  above 200. Highlight these datapoints by changing their color. The purpose of this
  visualization is to identify and focus on patients who may be at higher cardiovascular
  risk, aiding in health assessments. Also, include the target variable to differentiate
  between patients with and without cardiovascular disease using different shapes
  for each group.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to highlight
  patients with high restingBP or serumcholestrol levels?

  2. Would you like to use specific shapes to represent patients with and without
  cardiovascular disease?

  3. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to include for highlighting
  important data points?

  4. Would you prefer a specific range or scale for the x-axis (age) and y-axis (maxheartrate)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers for each datapoint?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  7. Do you need a legend to differentiate the shapes and colors used in the plot?

  8. Would you prefer gridlines in the background of the scatter plot for better readability?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.
