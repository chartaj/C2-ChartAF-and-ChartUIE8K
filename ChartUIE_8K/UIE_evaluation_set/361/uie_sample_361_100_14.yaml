initial_prompt: I have some cardiovascular disease data with various patient attributes
  and conditions such as age, gender, chest pain, and more. I would like to create
  a column chart that shows the distribution of the 'age' and 'gender' of patients
  against the 'target' variable (1 for disease presence and 0 for absence). Please
  ensure the chart clearly differentiates between male and female patients and highlights
  which age groups and genders are more prevalent in having the disease. The goal
  is to quickly visualize and interpret which demographics are most affected by cardiovascular
  diseases.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating male and female
  patients?

  2. What age groups would you like to use for segmentation (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.)?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for easier readability?

  4. Would you like to display data labels on the bars for precise values?

  5. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal column bars for this chart?

  6. Is it necessary to include a legend in the chart to indicate gender?

  7. Should the chart have a specific title? If so, what should it be?

  8. Do you have any preference for the font style or size used in the chart?

  9. Would you like to include a trend line or any additional markers to emphasize
  specific data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, 71-80, 81-90.

  3. Yes.

  4. Yes, please.

  5. Vertical column bars.

  6. Yes, it is necessary.

  7. "Cardiovascular Disease Distribution by Age and Gender"

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.'
