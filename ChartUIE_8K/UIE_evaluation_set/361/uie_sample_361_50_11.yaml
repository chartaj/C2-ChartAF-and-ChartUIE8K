initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for the Cardiovascular_Disease_Dataset. Visualize
  correlations between different health indicators like age, chest pain, resting BP,
  and serum cholesterol. Ensure missing values are highlighted distinctively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. What range of colors would you prefer to indicate the strength of correlations?

  3. How would you like missing values to be highlighted distinctively in the heatmap?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the scale or normalization of the data?

  5. Would you like to include labels for the correlation coefficients on the heatmap
  squares?

  6. Should there be a specific color legend or scale bar included for clarity?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the labels and titles?

  8. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you would like for the heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer any grid lines or separators between the cells of the heatmap?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include on
  the heatmap?'
