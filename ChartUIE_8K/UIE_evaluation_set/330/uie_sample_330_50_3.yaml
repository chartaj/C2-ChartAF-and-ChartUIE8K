initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for the dataset of essential proteins showing the
  variation over different time intervals. Use 'time' as the y-axis and the numerical
  columns (40, 50, 60, etc.) as the x-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display a legend to interpret the color intensity?

  3. Would you like the y-axis (''time'') labels to be rotated or formatted in a particular
  way?

  4. Should the numerical range on the x-axis be displayed in ascending order?

  5. Do you prefer gridlines to be visible within the heatmap cells?

  6. Would you like to include annotations/data values within the heatmap cells?

  7. Is there a specific range of values you want to highlight or use as a threshold?

  8. Should the heatmap include a title or any specific text?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, it should display a legend.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, in ascending order.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, include a title: "Variation of Essential Protein Levels Over Time".

  9. I do not know.'
