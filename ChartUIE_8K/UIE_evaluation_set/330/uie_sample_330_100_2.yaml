initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the measures of different proteins
  over time. Highlight significant fluctuations and patterns in protein levels between
  time points 40 and 260, focusing specifically on the proteins YAL001C, YAL014C,
  and YAL016W. Use text annotations for peak values and significant drops to emphasize
  changes. The purpose is to identify key trends and anomalies in the protein data
  to better understand their behavior over time. This visualization will aid in the
  analysis of protein stability, expression, and potential implications in biological
  processes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant fluctuations
  and patterns?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the proteins YAL001C,
  YAL014C, and YAL016W?

  3. Are there specific labels or titles you would like to see on the axes?

  4. How detailed do you want the text annotations for peak values and significant
  drops to be?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  7. Do you want to include a trend line or smooth curve to visualize overall trends?

  8. Should the chart have any specific margins or spacing around the edges for better
  clarity?

  9. Is there a specific style or format for the box plots you prefer (e.g., whisker
  length, notch display)?

  10. Would you like to include any specific reference lines or markers for key time
  points in the data?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend to differentiate between the proteins
  YAL001C, YAL014C, and YAL016W.

  3. The x-axis should be labeled "Time Points" and the y-axis should be labeled "Protein
  Levels".

  4. I would like the text annotations for peak values and significant drops to be
  detailed enough to clearly show the changes.

  5. I am not sure about grid lines, I will leave that up to you.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for fonts or font sizes for the annotations
  and labels.

  7. Yes, including a trend line or smooth curve to visualize overall trends would
  be helpful.

  8. I do not know about any specific margins or spacing requirements.

  9. I am not sure about the style or format for the box plots, whatever you think
  is best.

  10. Yes, include specific reference lines or markers for key time points like 40,
  150, and 260.'
