initial_prompt: Visualize the data using a box plot for columns 40-260 across samples.
  Highlight significant variance. Annotate key data points to emphasize unique values.
  Focus on trends for essential proteins in bioinformatics.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the box plots to highlight
  significant variance?

  2. Would you like specific key data points to be annotated with text or symbols?

  3. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation (e.g., horizontal or vertical)
  for the box plots?

  4. Are there any specific labels or legends that you want to include for better
  clarity?

  10. Are there any additional statistical summaries you want included on the box
  plot (e.g., mean, median)?'
