initial_prompt: Create a ridgeplot showing the variation of gene expression over time
  for different time intervals. Use text annotations for key data points and highlight
  significant trends.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the ridgeplot?

  2. Do you have a specific font preference for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the plot?

  4. How would you like significant trends to be highlighted (e.g., color change,
  bold lines)?

  5. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the ridgeplot?

  6. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels be customized in any particular way?

  7. Do you have a preferred size or format for the plot legend?

  8. Are there any specific time intervals or gene expressions that you want to emphasize?

  9. Do you prefer a smooth or stepped representation for the ridge lines?

  10. How would you like the key data points to be annotated (e.g., arrows, labels,
  different markers)?'
