initial_prompt: I want to visualize the distribution of salaries in USD for different
  job titles in the data science field. Please create a histogram showing the frequency
  of salary ranges (in USD) on the x-axis, broken down by job titles on the y-axis.
  The histogram should give a clear view of how salaries are spread across various
  roles such as Data Scientist, Machine Learning Scientist, and Big Data Engineer.
  Ensure the chart is color-coded by job title and includes a legend. The data context
  should be maintained, reflecting salaries from different countries and experience
  levels.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for different job titles?

  2. What bin size would you prefer for the salary ranges on the x-axis?

  3. Should the legend be displayed inside or outside the chart area?

  4. Do you have any specific title or labels you would like to include for the axes?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines to help read the histogram?

  6. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical bar layout for job titles on the y-axis?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  8. Do you want to include any annotations or specific markers to highlight certain
  data points?

  9. Would you like to display the exact count of salaries within each range on the
  histogram bars?'
