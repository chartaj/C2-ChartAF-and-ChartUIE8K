initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of job titles
  against company locations for data science job salaries. Specifically, I'd like
  to see which job titles are most common in various company locations; this will
  help us understand regional demand for specific roles. The data should show job
  titles on one axis and company locations on the other. Make sure to highlight regions
  with higher concentrations of specific job titles. Use color intensity to represent
  the number of occurrences for each combination of job title and company location.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for specific data points on the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the job titles and company locations on
  the axes?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend that explains the color intensity scale?

  5. Do you have any preference for the size and layout of the heatmap?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the labels and titles
  on the chart?

  7. Do you need any annotations or notes to emphasize specific regions with high
  concentrations?

  8. Should the heatmap display exact counts or just use color intensity to represent
  data density?'
