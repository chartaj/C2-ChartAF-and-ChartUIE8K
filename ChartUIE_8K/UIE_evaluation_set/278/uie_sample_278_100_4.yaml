initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for the "Pizza In Brooklyn" dataset. The chart
  should show the different aspects that make a pizza good according to the responses.
  The x-axis should list the different aspects (Toppings, A lot of cheese, Soft dough,
  etc.), and the y-axis should represent the number of responses for each aspect.
  Make sure to differentiate between each aspect using different colors. The chart
  should help to understand what people in Brooklyn think makes a pizza good.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the aspects
  on the chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on each bar to show the exact number of
  responses?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the bars be displayed in any specific order (e.g., alphabetical by aspect
  or descending by response count)?

  5. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there any specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  7. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the chart for context?

  8. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal
  bars)?

  9. Are there any specific axis ranges or scales you want to enforce on the y-axis?

  10. Do you have any preference regarding the legend position or format?'
