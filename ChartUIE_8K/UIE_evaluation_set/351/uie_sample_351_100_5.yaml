initial_prompt: 'Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing global video game
  sales from the provided dataset. The heatmap should highlight sales data across
  different regions: North America, Europe, Japan, and others. Each region''s sales
  should be represented by different color intensities based on the sales volume.
  Ensure the map is clear and interactive, allowing for a detailed view of sales distribution.
  Additionally, include tooltips to display specific sales numbers when hovering over
  each region. This visualization will help in understanding the global market performance
  of various video games. Thank you!'

  ranges like low, medium, high)?

  5. Are there any specific regions or countries that you want to emphasize more than
  others?

  6. Would you like the sales data to be aggregated or disaggregated by specific time
  periods or years?

  7. Do you prefer the tooltips to include additional information besides sales numbers,

  8. Should there be any specific visual indicators for highlighting extreme sales
  values or outliers within the regions?'
