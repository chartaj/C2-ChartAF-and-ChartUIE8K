initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize global video game sales across different
  platforms using the provided dataset. Highlight top-selling platforms and use text
  annotations to emphasize specific data points, such as platforms with the highest
  and lowest sales figures. Make sure to include the sales in different regions (NA,
  EU, JP, etc.) to provide a comprehensive view. Additionally, add a section for critic
  and user scores to see how ratings correlate with sales. This will help in understanding
  the success factors of various platforms and games.

  2. Would you like the bars sorted in ascending or descending order of sales?

  prominently?

  7. Do you want to include a legend for different regions (NA, EU, JP, etc.)?

  8. Is there a specific range for the critic and user scores you would like to focus
  on?

  9. Do you prefer a specific style for the bar chart (e.g., 2D, 3D)?
