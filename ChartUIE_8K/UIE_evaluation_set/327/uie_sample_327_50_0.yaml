initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart displaying the distribution of different
  E. coli sequence names. Highlight specific sequences that have higher occurrence
  rates. Annotations should show exact values for those highlighted. The purpose is
  to visualize genomic data proportions in an easily interpretable manner. This will
  help identify dominant sequences effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the pie chart?

  2. How would you like the highlighted sequences to be distinguished (e.g., different
  color, bold outline)?

  3. Should the chart include a legend? If so, do you have any specific preferences
  for it?

  4. Would you prefer the percentages or raw count values to be shown in the annotations?

  5. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the annotations?

  6. Should the pie chart include labels for each segment, or only for the highlighted
  sequences?

  7. Do you have any preferences on the order in which the sequences are displayed
  (e.g., by occurrence rate, alphabetically)?

  8. Would you like to add a title and/or subtitle to the pie chart? If yes, please
  specify.

  9. Do you want any additional information or contextual data to be included in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different color.

  3. Yes, I do not have any specific preference.

  4. Exact values.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Only for the highlighted sequences.

  7. By occurrence rate.

  8. Yes, please. Title: "Distribution of E. coli Sequence Names". Subtitle: "Highlighted
  sequences indicate higher occurrence rates".

  9. I do not know.'
