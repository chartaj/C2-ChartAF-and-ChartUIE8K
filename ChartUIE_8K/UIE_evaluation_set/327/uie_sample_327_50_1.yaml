initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize Ecoli genomic data.
  Highlight and annotate critical metrics like 'mcg', 'gvh', and 'lip'. Emphasize
  the 'Sequence Name' for better contextual understanding of the data patterns and
  anomalies.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different metrics (''mcg'',
  ''gvh'', ''lip'') in the parallel coordinates chart?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for line styles or thickness to emphasize the
  ''Sequence Name''?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or annotations for the critical metrics (''mcg'',
  ''gvh'', ''lip'')?

  4. Do you prefer any particular axis scaling (linear or logarithmic) for the metrics?

  5. Is there a preferred order for the attributes along the axes in the parallel
  coordinates chart?

  6. Do you have any requirements for the background color or gridlines in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any legends or specific labels for better contextual
  understanding?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, specific labels or annotations for ''mcg'', ''gvh'', and ''lip'' would be
  helpful.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, including legends or specific labels for better contextual understanding
  would be great.
