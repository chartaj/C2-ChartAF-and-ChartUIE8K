  5. Would you like a title for the heatmap? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines to be visible between the cells of the heatmap?

  7. Would you like annotations within the heatmap cells to indicate the exact amount
  of missing data?

  8. Should the heatmap have a specified range for the density values or should it
  be automatically adjusted?'
