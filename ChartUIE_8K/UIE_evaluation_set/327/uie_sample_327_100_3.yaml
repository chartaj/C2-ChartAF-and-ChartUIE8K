initial_prompt: Please create a box chart for the Ecoli Data Set focusing on the columns
  mcg, gvh, lip, chg, aac, alm1, and alm2. This chart should show the distribution
  of values in each category to understand the spread and identify any potential outliers
  in the genomic data. Make sure to label each axis appropriately, with the x-axis
  representing the different columns and the y-axis showing the range of values. This
  visualization will help us better analyze the variability and central tendency across
  the different features in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have preferences for the color palette or theme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the box chart?

  3. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical orientation for the box chart?

  4. Is there a preferred width or style for the box plot lines and whiskers?

  5. Should outliers be displayed as individual points or summarized differently?

  6. Would you like to add grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific legends or titles you would like to include in the chart?

  8. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  9. Do you have a preference for the range scale of the y-axis (e.g., starting at
  zero or fit to data)?

  10. Are there any comparative statistics (e.g., mean or median lines) you would
  like to feature on the box chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Vertical orientation will work.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Outliers should be displayed as individual points.

  6. Yes, please add grid lines for better readability.

  7. No specific legends or titles in mind.

  8. I do not have any preference for the font style or size.

  9. Fit the y-axis to the data.

  10. Including median lines would be good.'
