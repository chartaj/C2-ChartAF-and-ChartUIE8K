initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize surface temperature change over
  the years for various countries. Use data from 1961 to 2022 and plot each year on
  the x-axis and the temperature change (in Celsius) on the y-axis. Different countries
  can be represented by different colors or markers. This chart should help illustrate
  trends in temperature changes over time across different regions. Title it "Surface
  Temperature Change Over Time by Country" and make sure to label the axes and include
  a legend. This will highlight the climate change trends per country effectively.
