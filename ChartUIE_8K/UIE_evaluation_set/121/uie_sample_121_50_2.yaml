initial_prompt: Visualize the environmental impact of different food products using
  a heatmap. Highlight total emissions, farm emissions, and animal feed contributions.
  Add textual annotations for top and bottom emitters in each category to focus viewer
  attention.
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap? \n2. Do you have a\
  \ preference for the color gradient, such as using a range from blue to red?\n3.\
  \ Would you like the heatmap to display numerical values within each cell?\n4. How\
  \ would you like the top and bottom emitters to be annotated?\n5. How prominent\
  \ should the textual annotations be for the top and bottom emitters?\n6. Is there\
  \ a preferred font style or size for the textual annotations?\n7. Do you have a\
  \ specific layout or orientation in mind for the heatmap?\n8. Would you like the\
  \ categories (total emissions, farm emissions, animal feed contributions) to be\
  \ color-coded or differentiated in another way?\n9. Should the chart include a legend\
  \ or additional labels to explain the color coding and annotations?\n10. How detailed\
  \ should the axis labels and titles be?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Yes, displaying numerical values within each cell would be helpful.

  4. Annotate the top emitters with "High Emissions" and the bottom emitters with
  "Low Emissions".

  5. The textual annotations should be prominent but not overwhelming.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, color-coding the categories would be useful.

  9. Yes, include a legend to explain the color coding and annotations.
