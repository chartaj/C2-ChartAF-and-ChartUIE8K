initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the environmental impact of various
  food products. Highlight high emissions and resource usage areas to draw attention
  to them. Use text annotations to detail specific values, particularly for total
  emissions and freshwater withdrawals. This will help in quickly identifying which
  food products have the highest environmental impact. Make sure to include all columns
  in the heatmap to compare factors like greenhouse gas emissions, land use, and eutrophying
  emissions across different food products. The purpose is to emphasize the sustainability
  of food consumption.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap to
  make extremes more noticeable?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include any gradient or solid color transitions
  between high and low values?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal axis arrangement)?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend or color bar for reference? If yes, do you
  have any specific requirements for it?

  6. Do you want to highlight specific ranges of values using different shades or
  patterns?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the food products, such as alphabetical
  or sorted by a specific attribute?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be visible or invisible in the heatmap?

  9. How would you like to handle missing values in the dataset within the heatmap?

  10. Are there any preferences for margin sizes or spacing between the heatmap elements?'
