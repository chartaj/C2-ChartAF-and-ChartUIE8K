initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the total emissions from various
  food products over different stages like land use change, animal feed, farm, and
  processing. Highlight key food products to emphasize those with extremities in emissions.
  Add text annotations for the highest and lowest emission values to draw attention.
  This visualization aims to illustrate the environmental impact of food production,
  focusing on greenhouse gas emissions. Use different colors for each emission stage
  to differentiate them. This will help viewers quickly understand which stages contribute
  most to total emissions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the style of text annotations for the
  highest and lowest emission values?

  2. Are there specific key food products you would like to be emphasized in the chart?

  3. Do you have any preference for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) to differentiate
  between the different stages of emissions?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend for the different colors representing
  each emission stage?

  5. Are there specific colors you prefer to use for each emission stage?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color or gridline style?

  7. Would you like to include data labels directly on the line chart for additional
  clarity?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations and axis
  labels?

  9. Is there a specific title you would like to give to the chart?

  10. Would you like to include tooltips or hover text for additional data insights
  on each data point?'
