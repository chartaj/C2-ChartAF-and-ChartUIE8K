initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between primate milk
  composition and brain size, focusing on neocortex percentage. Highlight species
  with notable data points in terms of kcal per g, percentage of fat, protein, and
  lactose. Annotate these key data points to emphasize interesting patterns or outliers.
  Use different colors to distinguish between clades. Ensure to include a legend explaining
  color coding and descriptions to provide context for the data on primate biology,
  emphasizing how milk composition correlates with brain size. This will help in understanding
  primate evolutionary traits related to diet and cognition.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to distinguish
  between different clades?

  2. Would you prefer species names to be abbreviated or written in full in the annotations?

  3. How would you like the notable data points to be highlighted (e.g., different
  marker shapes, sizes, or colors)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations?

  5. How detailed do you want the legend to be (e.g., simple color coding or additional
  descriptive information)?

  6. Should outliers be labeled differently or have a unique marker for easy identification?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you want the clades to be displayed?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the plot for better readability?

  10. Should the plot include a title, and if so, do you have a specific title in
  mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer species names to be abbreviated.

  3. Different marker shapes for notable data points would be great.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I would like the legend to include simple color coding with additional descriptive
  information.

  6. Yes, outliers should have a unique marker for easy identification.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  10. Yes, include a title. A specific title could be "Relationship Between Primate
  Milk Composition and Brain Size (Neocortex Percentage)".'
