initial_prompt: I have data on primate milk composition and brain size measurements
  from different species. Could you please create a line chart for me that shows the
  relationship between the percentage of neocortex and various milk composition parameters
  such as kcal per gram, percentage of fat, protein, and lactose? Make sure to plot
  each milk composition parameter on a separate line on the same graph to observe
  any trends or correlations over different species. Use the clade information to
  differentiate between species groups. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the clades?

  2. What line styles would you prefer for each milk composition parameter (e.g.,
  solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for the chart background (e.g., grid lines, plain)?

  4. Should the chart include data labels for each data point or just for specific
  points?

  5. Are there any specific axis titles or labels you would like to use, or should
  default titles be applied?

  6. Do you want to include any annotations or reference lines for specific data points
  or thresholds?

  7. What level of detail do you prefer for the legend (e.g., simple vs. detailed)?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the chart labels and
  titles?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the clades.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer grid lines for the chart background.

  4. Data labels for specific points would be fine.

  5. Default titles can be applied.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. A simple legend would be sufficient.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.'
