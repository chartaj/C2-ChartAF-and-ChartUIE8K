initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the "Primate milk and brain size" dataset.
  The heatmap should visualize the relationships among the nutritional components
  (kcal.per.g, perc.fat, perc.protein, perc.lactose) and other attributes such as
  mass and neocortex.perc across the different species. Use the species as labels
  for the y-axis and the nutritional components, mass, and neocortex.perc as labels
  for the x-axis. Make sure to handle any missing values appropriately, possibly by
  omitting or imputing data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like missing values to be handled: omitted or imputed?

  3. Do you prefer a specific imputation method for missing values (e.g., mean, median,
  mode)?

  4. Would you like to display a color bar or legend indicating the scale of values?

  5. Should the heatmap display exact value annotations on the cells?

  6. Do you have any preference for the ordering of species and attributes on the
  axes?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include on the axes and the
  heatmap?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be shown between the cells?

  9. Do you prefer a specific size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Please omit the missing values.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please display a color bar or legend.

  5. No, I do not need exact value annotations on the cells.

  6. I have no specific preference for the ordering.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please show grid lines between the cells.

  9. I have no specific preference for the size or aspect ratio.'
