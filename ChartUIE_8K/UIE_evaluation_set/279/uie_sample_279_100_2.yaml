initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to compare different primate species based on their
  average percentage of fat, protein, and lactose. Highlight the species with the
  highest and lowest values in each category. Add text annotations to display the
  exact percentage values for these highlighted species. The purpose of this visualization
  is to understand the nutritional composition of primate milk and its potential relationship
  to brain size. This can visually emphasize how nutrition might correlate with neocortex
  percentage, which will aid in analyzing biological and evolutionary trends.
questions: '1. Would you prefer a horizontal or vertical bar chart?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing fat, protein,
  and lactose?

  3. How would you like the highlighted species (with the highest and lowest values)
  to be indicated? For example, different colors, border outlines, or shading?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations displaying
  the exact percentage values?

  5. Would you like the chart to include grid lines, and if so, should they be major
  or minor grid lines?

  6. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart?

  7. Should the chart include a title and subtitle, and if so, what text should be
  used?

  8. Do you want axis labels for both the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what specific
  labels would you prefer?

  9. Would you like a legend to differentiate among fat, protein, and lactose percentages,
  and where would you like it positioned?

  10. Should the chart include any additional information or annotations related to
  neocortex percentage, or focus solely on the nutritional components?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. Different colors.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Major grid lines.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes. Title: "Nutritional Composition of Primate Milk". Subtitle: "Comparison
  of Fat, Protein, and Lactose Percentages".

  8. Yes. X-axis: "Primate Species". Y-axis: "Percentage Composition".

  9. Yes, positioned at the top right.

  10. Focus solely on the nutritional components.'
