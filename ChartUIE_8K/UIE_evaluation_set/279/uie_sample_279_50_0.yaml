initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot comparing ''mass'' and ''neocortex.perc'' for
  primates. Highlight outliers and provide text annotations for species with highest
  and lowest ''kcal.per.g''. Context: Primate milk and brain size study.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different color, shape)?

  3. Do you have a specific font preference for the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or not?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for the data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  6. Would you like to include labels for data points other than the highest and lowest
  ''kcal.per.g''?

  7. Should the axes have a specific range or scale (e.g., logarithmic)?

  8. Do you want both ''mass'' and ''neocortex.perc'' axes to have titles or labels?

  9. Would you like a legend to indicate highlighted outliers?

  10. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a preferred title?'
