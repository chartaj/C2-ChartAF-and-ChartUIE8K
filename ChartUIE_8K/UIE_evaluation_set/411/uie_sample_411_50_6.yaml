initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing urban population percentages from
  1960 to 2020, highlighting countries with significant urban population changes,
  particularly focusing on years with complete data. Visualize fluctuations over years
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to see the exact percentage values for urban populations displayed
  on the map?

  3. Should any specific countries or regions be emphasized more than others?

  4. Do you prefer a particular map projection style (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like significant changes in urban population
  to be highlighted?

  6. How granular should the time interval be when visualizing trends (e.g., every
  year, every decade)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the range of colors to use in the heatmap to indicate
  low to high values?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the map for context?

  9. Is there a specific legend style you prefer for explaining the heatmap colors?

  10. Should the heatmap include geographic boundaries such as country or region borders?'
