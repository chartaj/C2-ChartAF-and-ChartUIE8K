initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the declining urban population
  figures globally, using the provided data on urban population percentages from 1960
  to 2020 for various countries. Highlight markers should be used to emphasize significant
  drops in urban population percentages. Include text annotations for the years where
  the most considerable changes occur to draw attention. Make sure the x-axis represents
  the years and the y-axis represents the urban population percentage. Use different
  colors for each country to distinguish them easily. The visualization aims to provide
  a clear, comparative overview of urban population trends over the decades.
questions: '1. Do you have a color palette preference for distinguishing different
  countries?

  2. Are there specific years you want to be highlighted for the most significant
  changes?

  3. How would you like the significant drops in urban population percentages to be
  represented? (e.g., specific marker shape or size)

  4. Do you have a font style or size preference for text annotations?

  5. Would you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  6. Are there any additional elements you would like to include in the chart? (e.g.,
  gridlines, legend placement)

  7. Should we include a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If yes, do you have
  suggested text for them?

  8. Do you have any axis label preferences (e.g., formatting, positioning)?

  9. Is there a specific background style or color you would like for the chart?

  10. Are there specific countries or regions you want to be especially emphasized
  in the visualization?'
