initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the percentage of urban population for
  various countries from 1960 to 2020. Highlight the years with the highest urbanization
  rates for each country. Use text annotations to highlight key data points, such
  as major increases or decreases in urban population figures. The chart should also
  distinguish between different decades to provide a clear temporal context. This
  visualization aims to convey trends in urbanization across the globe, helping viewers
  understand which countries have seen significant urban population growth over time.
  Include editorial comments to provide context.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preference for font style and size for text annotations?

  3. Should the decades be distinguished by color bands or labels?

  4. Do you want to include country names directly on the heatmap or as a separate
  legend?

  5. How do you prefer highlighting the years with the highest urbanization rates?
  (e.g., bold text, different color, icons)

  6. What style of borders or grids do you prefer between the cells?

  7. Would you like to have any specific editorial comment styles or placements in
  the visualization?

  8. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the heatmap (e.g., countries
  on the y-axis, years on the x-axis, or vice versa)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Labels would be preferable.

  4. Include country names directly on the heatmap.

  5. Different color would be best for highlighting the highest urbanization rates.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Countries on the y-axis and years on the x-axis.'
