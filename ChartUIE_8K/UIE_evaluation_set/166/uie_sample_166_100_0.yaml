initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between Age
  and Blood Pressure for different diseases in the dataset. Use shapes like trend
  lines to show any significant trends or patterns. Highlight data points based on
  gender to see if there are any visible differences. Label axes clearly and include
  a legend for the different diseases. The purpose of this scatter plot is to analyze
  how age and blood pressure vary across diseases and genders among patients, which
  could provide valuable insights for healthcare providers in terms of treatment strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different genders?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use to represent different diseases
  in the legend?

  3. How would you like the trend lines to be displayed (e.g., dotted, dashed, or
  solid lines)?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the shape or marker type (e.g., circle,
  square, etc.) to denote data points?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or labels you''d like included on the scatter
  plot?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for the legend?

  7. Are there specific axis label formats or units you would like to use for Age
  and Blood Pressure?

  8. Would you like error bars or confidence intervals to be displayed for the trend
  lines?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?'
