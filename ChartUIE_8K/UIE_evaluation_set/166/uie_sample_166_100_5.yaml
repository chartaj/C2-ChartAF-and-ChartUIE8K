initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different diseases
  in the dataset. Please make sure the x-axis represents the names of the diseases
  and the y-axis represents the count of each disease occurrence. This will help me
  quickly understand which diseases are most common among patients in the dataset.
  Ensure that the chart is easy to read with labels and appropriate colors for clarity.
  Additionally, highlight any diseases that appear more than 10 times. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you prefer a specific order for the diseases on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by frequency)?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and axis titles?

  5. Do you need a legend, or is the chart self-explanatory with labels?

  6. How would you like the diseases that appear more than 10 times to be highlighted
  (e.g., different color, bold text)?

  7. Are there any specific margin or padding preferences for the chart layout?'
