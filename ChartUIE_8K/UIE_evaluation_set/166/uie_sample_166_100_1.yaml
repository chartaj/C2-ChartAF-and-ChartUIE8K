initial_prompt: Please create a histogram representing the “Age” distribution from
  the Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile dataset. Use highlights to distinguish
  different age groups visually. Also, include shape annotations to indicate the mean
  and median age. Additionally, use color variations to differentiate between genders
  in the histogram bars. The dataset has no missing values, so ensure the full range
  of ages is covered in the histogram. Include all unique values, especially for the
  categorical data like Disease, Symptom Types and Outcome Variables, to provide a
  comprehensive visual analysis.
