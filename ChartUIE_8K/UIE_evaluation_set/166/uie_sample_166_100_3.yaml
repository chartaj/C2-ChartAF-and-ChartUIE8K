initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot chart to visualize the Disease Symptoms and
  Patient Profile dataset. For each disease, plot the presence of fever, cough, fatigue,
  and difficulty breathing as separate categories on the x-axis. Each dot should represent
  an individual patient's data, with different colors for genders and sizes to show
  age variations. Include a legend for blood pressure and cholesterol level categories.
  The dot plot should also show the outcome variable (positive/negative) distinctly.
  This will help in analyzing patterns and correlations between symptoms and patient
  profiles effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you would
  like to use for representing genders?

  2. How would you prefer to categorize age groups for the dot sizes or would you
  prefer a continuous scale?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the shape of the dots?

  4. Is there a particular order you would like the symptoms (fever, cough, fatigue,
  difficulty breathing) to be displayed on the x-axis?

  5. How would you like the legend to be displayed for blood pressure and cholesterol
  level categories?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference for representing genders.

  2. I would prefer to categorize age groups, but I am not sure how to do it. Maybe
  you can suggest a common approach?

  3. I do not have any specific preferences for the shape of the dots.

  4. I am not sure about the order of symptoms on the x-axis. You can choose an order
  that makes sense.

  5. I do not know. You can decide the best way to display the legend for blood pressure
  and cholesterol level categories.'
