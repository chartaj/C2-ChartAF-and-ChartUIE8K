initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the trends of water quality parameters
  over time. Highlight significant values and annotate to clarify data points related
  to potability. Add text annotations for pH, Conductivity, and Trihalomethanes values
  at critical points.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the line chart?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the style and color of the annotations?

  3. How would you like significant values to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  bold, markers)?

  4. Are there any specific critical points you want to pre-define for pH, Conductivity,
  and Trihalomethanes?

  5. What level of labeling detail do you desire for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Should there be grid lines on the chart, and if so, how prominent should they
  be?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart titles and labels?

  9. Would you like to see any trend lines or moving averages included in the line
  chart for better visual analysis?'
