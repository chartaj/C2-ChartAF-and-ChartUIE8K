initial_prompt: Create a pie chart using the water quality data to visualize the distribution
  of missing values across different attributes. Highlight sections with the most
  missing data to emphasize the completeness of the dataset. Annotate significant
  segments to display the counts of missing values for each attribute. This will help
  in identifying key areas needing attention for data cleansing. Make sure the chart
  is clear and visually appealing to laypersons and experts alike, focusing on data
  completeness. Use the provided sample data as an example to ensure realistic representation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend or would you prefer direct annotations
  on each segment?

  3. How would you like the missing value counts to be annotated on the chart (e.g.,
  percentages, absolute numbers, both)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  5. Should there be a title or subtitle on the pie chart, and if so, what should
  it be?

  6. Do you have any preference for how the segments with the most missing data should
  be highlighted (e.g., different color, shading, border)?

  7. Would you like any supplementary information or context to be included in the
  chart (such as a brief explanation or note on the dataset)?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the segments to be arranged
  (e.g., by the amount of missing data, alphabetically)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer direct annotations on each segment.

  3. Both percentages and absolute numbers would be great.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Missing Values in Water Quality Data".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. By the amount of missing data, please.'
