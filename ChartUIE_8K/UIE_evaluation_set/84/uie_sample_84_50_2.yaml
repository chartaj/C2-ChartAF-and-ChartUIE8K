initial_prompt: Create a pie chart highlighting the potability ratio of water samples,
  using text annotations for missing values in 'Sulfate' and 'ph'. Use different colors
  to emphasize potable and non-potable water proportions. This visual will help assess
  water safety and quality promptly.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for potable and non-potable water
  sections in the pie chart?

  2. What size and style do you prefer for text annotations indicating missing values
  in ''Sulfate'' and ''ph''?

  3. Do you wish to display the exact percentage values on the pie chart segments?

  4. Should the chart include a legend for clarity, and if so, how would you like
  it to be styled?

  5. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  6. How would you prefer the font style and size for the chart labels and annotations?

  7. Do you want the missing value annotations to be inside the pie chart or positioned
  outside with lines pointing to the relevant sections?

  8. Are there any specific border styles or effects you prefer for the pie chart
  segments?

  9. Should the chart include additional context or notes at the bottom or side to
  emphasize the purpose of the visualization?'
