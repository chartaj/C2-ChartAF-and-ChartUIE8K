initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the spread and outliers for
  'ph', 'Hardness', 'Solids', 'Chloramines', 'Sulfate', 'Conductivity', 'Organic_carbon',
  'Trihalomethanes', and 'Turbidity' columns to analyze water quality factors. Make
  sure missing values are considered.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like each box plot to be color-coded differently?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be handled or displayed in the chart?

  4. Do you prefer gridlines in the background of the chart for better readability?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or annotations for outliers?

  6. Should the chart title and axis labels have any particular format or style?
