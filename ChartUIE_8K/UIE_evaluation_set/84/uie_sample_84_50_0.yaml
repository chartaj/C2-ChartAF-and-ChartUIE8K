initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize water quality parameters like pH, Hardness,
  Solids, and Potability. Highlight areas with missing values and annotate extreme
  values to emphasize data trends for better decision-making in water treatment.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like missing values to be highlighted (e.g., specific color, pattern)?

  3. Where would you like annotations for extreme values to be placed (inside the
  cell, hover tooltip, etc.)?

  4. Do you have any preferred labels or formats for the axis titles and tick marks?

  5. Would you like to set any specific range or threshold values for highlighting
  extreme values?

  6. Is there any specific arrangement or ordering of the data attributes that you
  prefer on the heatmap axes?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be placed
  (top, bottom, side, etc.)?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?'

  2. Specific color would be fine.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, I''d like to set specific threshold values for highlighting extreme values,

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful, but I am not sure where it should be placed.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
