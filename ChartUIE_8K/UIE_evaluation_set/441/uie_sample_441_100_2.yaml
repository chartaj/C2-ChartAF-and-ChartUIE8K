initial_prompt: Please create a circular treemap that visualizes the performance of
  women's college basketball teams over various years. The treemap should utilize
  data such as 'year', 'school', 'seed', 'conference', and performance metrics like
  'reg_w', 'reg_l', 'tourney_w', 'tourney_l', and 'full_percent'. Highlight the top-performing
  schools and important metrics to draw attention. Include annotations to showcase
  standout teams or particular achievements. This visualization will help understand
  the performance trends and key players in women's college basketball.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting top-performing
  schools and important metrics?

  2. Are there specific years or ranges of years you would like to prioritize in the
  visualization?

  3. Should any particular performance metrics (e.g., ''reg_w'', ''tourney_w'', ''full_percent'')
  be emphasized more than others?

  4. What kind of annotations would you like to see for standout teams or achievements
  (e.g., labels, callouts)?

  5. Do you have a preference for how schools from different conferences should be
  distinguished (e.g., different shapes, colors, or sections)?

  6. How detailed should the hierarchical structure be in the circular treemap (e.g.,
  should we group by conference first, then by school)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional background information or context in
  the visualization (e.g., historical performance data)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I''m not sure about specific years, but it might be good to cover the last decade
  or two.

  3. Emphasize ''full_percent'' and ''tourney_w'' more than others.

  4. Labels and callouts for standout teams and achievements would be great.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Group by conference first, then by school.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for additional background information.'
