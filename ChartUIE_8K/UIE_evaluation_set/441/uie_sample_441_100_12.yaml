initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map visualizing women's college basketball
  performance. Use data for each school's 'reg_percent' (regular season win percentage)
  across different conferences and years. Highlight the performance variations geographically
  by plotting schools' locations. Include filters for year and conference to allow
  dynamic exploration of data trends over time and among different groups. The color
  gradient should represent 'reg_percent' to easily spot high-performing and low-performing
  regions. Ensure to provide a legend and a tooltip that shows detailed statistics,
  such as school name, year, conference, and win percentages when hovering over a
  region.
