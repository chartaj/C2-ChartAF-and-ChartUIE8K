initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the performance trends in women's
  college basketball, focusing on the "reg_percent" and "full_percent" columns over
  the given years. Use different colors to represent individual schools like "Arizona
  St.", "Auburn", and "Cheyney", and plot their winning percentages in the regular
  season and the full season. It would be helpful to include markers for each data
