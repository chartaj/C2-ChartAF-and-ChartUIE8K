initial_prompt: 'Please create a radar chart for the women college basketball data
  to compare the performance metrics of different schools in the 1982 tournament.
  Use the following metrics: regular season wins (reg_w), regular season losses (reg_l),
  regular season win percentage (reg_percent), tournament wins (tourney_w), tournament
  losses (tourney_l), and overall win percentage (full_percent). Visualize Arizona
  St., Auburn, and Cheyney separately to see their strengths and weaknesses in each
  category. Ensure each axis is labeled, and the chart is easy to interpret. Thank
  you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each school in the radar
  chart?

  2. Do you prefer the data points to be connected with lines, or would you like to
  see the points marked distinctly on the radar chart?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to identify each school, or should the labels
  be placed directly on the chart?

  4. Do you have any preference for the scale of each axis (e.g., all axes should
  have the same scale or each axis should be scaled individually)?

  5. Should the chart title be specific or generic (e.g., ''Performance Metrics of
  1982 Women College Basketball Schools'' vs. ''Radar Chart of Selected Schools in
  1982'')?

  6. Do you prefer to have gridlines or background fill colors to enhance the readability
  of the chart?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or key points that you would like to be
  highlighted on the radar chart?

  8. Should the axis labels be customized in terms of format or font size, or are
  the default settings acceptable?'
