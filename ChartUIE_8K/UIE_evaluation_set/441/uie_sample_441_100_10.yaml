initial_prompt: I'd like a Spline chart to visualize the performance trends of different
  women's college basketball teams over the years. The chart should plot 'year' on
  the X-axis and 'full_percent' on the Y-axis for each team ('school'). Include data
  points for 'reg_percent' as well. This will illustrate how their regular and full
  season win percentages have changed over time. Differentiate the teams with distinct
  colors and styles for easier comparison. Provide a legend for clarity. This should
  help in understanding the overall performance and progression of the teams in the
  college basketball scene.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different teams?

  2. Would you prefer solid or dashed lines to differentiate between ''reg_percent''
  and ''full_percent''?

  3. What style (e.g., line thickness or type) would you like for the different teams?

  4. What level of granularity (e.g., yearly, quarterly) would you prefer for the
  X-axis?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability? If so, any preference
  for their style?

  6. Do you want specific markers for data points on the spline chart?

  7. Would you like specific titles and labels for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  8. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the legend and axis
  labels?

  9. Should there be any annotations or highlights for specific events or milestones?

  10. Do you want to include any additional information or notes on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for different teams.

  2. Solid lines for ''full_percent'' and dashed lines for ''reg_percent'' should
  work well.

  3. I am not sure about the style for the different teams; you can choose what looks
  best for distinction.

  4. Yearly granularity for the X-axis would be ideal.

  5. Yes, including grid lines for better readability would be good. I don''t have
  a specific preference for their style.

  6. Specific markers for data points on the spline chart would be helpful.

  7. Yes, please include titles and labels for the X-axis and Y-axis. X-axis: "Year",
  Y-axis: "Win Percentage".

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the font style and size for the legend
  and axis labels.

  9. I am not sure about annotations or highlights for specific events or milestones.

  10. No additional information or notes needed.


  Thank you!'
