initial_prompt: I want a geographic heatmap visualizing the performance of women's
  college basketball teams. Use the school's location and plot data points for each
  year, representing the schools using different colors or shades. Include metrics
  like regular season wins, losses, and percentages, as well as tournament outcomes.
  Highlight top-performing conferences and note if their first tournament game was
  at home. This will help in understanding geographic trends and dominant regions
  over the years. Geographic accuracy and clear legend are crucial. Ensure the map
  is interactive for detailed inspection of specific schools or regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different schools
  or conferences?

  2. How would you like top-performing conferences to be highlighted?

  3. Should the map display categories of performance metrics (such as wins and losses)
  differently?

  4. Do you want any specific information to be included in tooltips when hovering
  over data points?

  5. Would you prefer a certain style or format for the legend?

  6. Are there any specific regions or schools that should be emphasized or treated
  differently in the visualization?

  7. Would you like any annotations or markers on the map for significant events or
  milestones?'
