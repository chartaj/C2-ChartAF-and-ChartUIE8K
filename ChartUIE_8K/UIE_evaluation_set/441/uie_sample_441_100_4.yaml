initial_prompt: 'I''d like a column chart visualizing women''s college basketball
  data. Specifically, the chart should compare the total wins ("full_w") and losses
  ("full_l") of several schools from different conferences. Each school should be
  represented by a separate column, with two stacked segments representing wins and
  losses. Ensure labels are clear and color-coded for easy comparison. Data points
  for each school should include their conference for added context. This will help
  visualize the performance of different teams across various conferences effectively.
  Use the sample data provided for schools like Arizona St., Auburn, and Cheyney.
