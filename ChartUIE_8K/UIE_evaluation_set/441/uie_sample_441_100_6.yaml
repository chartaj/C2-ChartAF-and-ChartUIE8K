initial_prompt: I have data on women college basketball teams from a CSV file. I want
  to visualize this data using a histogram. Specifically, I want to see the distribution
  of the 'reg_percent' (regular season win percentage) and compare it across different
  years and schools. Can you create a histogram that shows how many teams fall into
  different bins for their regular season win percentage? Also, highlight or differentiate
  between various conferences in the distribution. This way, I can understand which
  conferences have more high-performing teams. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the x-axis (win percentage) to be labeled in a specific range
  or increment?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color scheme to differentiate between the conferences?

  4. Should the histogram be stacked by conference or displayed side-by-side for each
  conference?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to identify the conferences in the histogram?

  6. Are there specific years you want to focus on, or should all available years
  be included?

  7. Do you prefer any specific type of data labeling or annotations on the histogram
  (e.g., percentages, counts)?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  9. Should the title of the histogram include specific keywords or a particular format?

  10. Do you have a preference for the axis labels'' format or size?'
