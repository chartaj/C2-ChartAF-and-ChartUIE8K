initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the 'Total_Bilirubin', 'Direct_Bilirubin',
  'Alkaline_Phosphotase', 'Alamine_Aminotransferase', and 'Aspartate_Aminotransferase'
  values from the Indian Liver Patient Records dataset. The chart should compare these
  values for different genders. This visualization will help in understanding the
  distribution and variability of these liver function indicators between male and
  female patients. Make sure to highlight any significant outliers or deviations in
  the data. The x-axis should represent the type of liver function test and the y-axis
  should represent the measured values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different genders in
  the chart?

  2. Would you prefer any specific style or size for outlier markers to ensure they
  are highlighted effectively?

  3. Are there any particular axis label formats or fonts you prefer?

  4. Do you want gridlines in the background to enhance readability?

  5. Should a legend be included, and if so, where would you prefer it to be placed?

  6. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include for the
  chart or axes?

  7. Do you prefer any particular order for the liver function tests on the x-axis?

  8. Would you like any reference lines or markers for specific value thresholds in
  the chart?

  9. Are there any preferences for the display of data points (e.g., jittering in
  the box plot)?

  10. Would you like the summary statistics (mean, median) to be explicitly marked
  on the box plots?'
