initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to analyze the distribution of age among
  the Indian Liver Patient Records dataset. Additionally, include separate histograms
  for gender showing the distribution of liver enzyme levels such as Total Bilirubin,
  Direct Bilirubin, Alkaline Phosphotase, Alamine Aminotransferase, and Aspartate
  Aminotransferase. Ensure the histograms are easy to compare and interpret, highlighting
  any significant differences or patterns observed between male and female patients.
  This will help in understanding the prevalence and severity of liver conditions
  across different ages and genders. Include labels, legends, and a title for clarity.
  Thank you!

  the histograms?

  7. Would you like the histograms to include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the histograms?
