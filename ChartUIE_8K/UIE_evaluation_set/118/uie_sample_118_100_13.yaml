initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart using the Indian Liver Patient Records
  dataset. The chart should display the count of unique values for the 'Gender' and
  'Dataset' columns. This way we can easily visualize the distribution of patients
  by gender and whether they are classified as having or not having liver disease.
  The inner circle of the donut should represent the 'Dataset' column, while the outer
  ring should represent the 'Gender' column. Ensure the chart is labeled appropriately
  for clear understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the ''Gender'' and ''Dataset''
  categories?

  2. Would you like to include a legend for the chart? If so, where would you prefer
  it to be placed?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the labeling of the inner and outer rings of
  the donut chart?

  4. Should the chart include percentage labels on each segment in addition to the
  count?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the labels and legend?

  6. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, what title should be displayed?

  7. Do you prefer any specific order for the categories within the ''Gender'' and
  ''Dataset'' columns?'
