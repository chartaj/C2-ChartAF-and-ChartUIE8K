initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize Indian Liver Patient Records data.
  Plot ''Age'' on the x-axis and ''Total_Bilirubin'' on the y-axis. Use different
  colors for ''Gender''. Include text annotations for outlier points of ''Total_Bilirubin''.
  Highlight points with ''Direct_Bilirubin'' values above the median. Purpose: Identify
  correlations between age and bilirubin levels, emphasizing gender differences and
  outliers. The chart should help healthcare professionals quickly assess anomalies
  and patterns in liver health across different ages and genders.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  genders in the scatter plot?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations on the outlier
  points?

  3. Do you want the text annotations to include any specific information besides
  highlighting the outliers?

  4. How would you like the highlighted points with ''Direct_Bilirubin'' values above
  the median to be visually distinguished (e.g., different shapes, outlines)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for marker size or style for the data points
  in the scatter plot?

  6. Is there a preferred title or specific labels you would like for the axes (x-axis
  ''Age'' and y-axis ''Total_Bilirubin'')?

  7. Would you prefer a legend to be included, and if so, where would you like it
  positioned on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific gridlines or background styles you would prefer for better
  readability?

  9. Do you have a preferred way for the data to be displayed/ordered on the chart
  for better pattern recognition?'

  3. No, just highlighting the outliers is fine.

  4. I am not sure, maybe different shapes could work.

  5. I have no specific preference.
