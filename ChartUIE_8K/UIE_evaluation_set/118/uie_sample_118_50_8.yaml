initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing age vs. total bilirubin levels for different
  genders. Include all available unique values and account for missing albumin and
  globulin ratio. Label axes accordingly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different genders?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the plot?

  3. Should data points be labeled with their corresponding ''Age'' or ''Total_Bilirubin''
  values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific markers for different genders on the plot?

  5. How would you like the missing ''Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio'' values to be represented,
  if at all?

  6. What size do you prefer for the dots on the plot?

  7. Should there be a legend indicating what each color or marker represents?

  8. Do you have a preference for the axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Would you like to include any trend lines or regression lines on the plot?
