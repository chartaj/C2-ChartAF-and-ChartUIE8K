initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart that visualizes the Indian Liver Patient Records
  data. The x-axis should represent Age, and the y-axis should display Total_Bilirubin
  levels. Use bubble size to indicate the Alkaline_Phosphotase value, and color-code
  bubbles by Gender. Annotate data points with extremely high Total_Bilirubin levels
  and low Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio values to identify outliers in liver health.
  Highlight bubbles for Dataset 1 to distinguish them from others. This visual will
  help assess liver conditions across different ages and genders, emphasizing significant
  anomalies. Make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for gender differentiation?

  2. How would you like the annotation for outliers to appear (e.g., labels, tooltips)?

  3. What specific range or threshold constitutes an ''extremely high'' Total_Bilirubin
  level in your view?

  4. What specific range or threshold constitutes a ''low'' Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio
  to identify outliers?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the bubble size scaling to represent Alkaline_Phosphotase
  values?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the axes
  and the chart?

  7. Would you prefer to use a specific shape or style to highlight bubbles for Dataset
  1?

  8. Do you have a preferred background style or grid style for the chart to enhance
  visual appeal?

  9. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the chart annotations
  to make them easy to interpret?

  10. Should there be any specific margins or padding around the chart to accommodate
  additional information or annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.
