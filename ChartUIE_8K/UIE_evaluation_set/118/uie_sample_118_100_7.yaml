initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot using the Indian Liver Patient Records
  dataset. The x-axis should represent 'Gender' and the y-axis should represent 'Total_Bilirubin'.
  Ensure that the plot reflects the distribution and density of Total Bilirubin levels
  for both genders in the dataset. Highlight any differences in the spread or central
  tendency of Total Bilirubin between male and female patients. Make sure to label
  the axes clearly and provide a title that reflects the focus on liver health in
  relation to gender. Thank you!
