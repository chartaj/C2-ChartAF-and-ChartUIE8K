initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing Spotify users, subscribers,
  and non-subscribers from 2015 to 2020. Highlight the fluctuations over different
  quartals to show growth trends. Annotate key data points, especially where there
  are significant changes in the number of subscribers or users. This will help to
  emphasize important moments in the data. Use different colors to distinguish between
  subscribers and non-subscribers, making it easier to compare. The bar chart should
  be clear and easy to interpret, as its purpose is to analyze user engagement trends
  over time.

  data points, such as providing the exact values or just highlighting changes?

  5. Is there a particular way you would prefer the quartals and years to be displayed
  on the x-axis, such as including grid lines or using specific date formats?

  data categories (e.g., subscribers, non-subscribers)?
