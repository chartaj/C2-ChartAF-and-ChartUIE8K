initial_prompt: I have a dataset about mushroom classification with attributes like
  cap shape, cap surface, cap color, bruises, odor, gill attachment, etc. I want to
  create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize this data. Each attribute should
  have its own axis, allowing me to compare the different characteristics across mushroom
  samples. It's important to clearly differentiate between the two classes of mushrooms
  (edible and poisonous) using colors, so patterns and correlations can be easily
  identified. This will help in understanding which features are most significant
  in determining whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  between edible and poisonous mushrooms?

  2. How would you prefer the axes to be ordered? By importance, alphabetical order,
  or any other specific order?

  3. Are there any specific axis scales or normalization requirements for any of the
  attributes?

  4. Would you prefer the axis labels to be rotated or formatted in a specific way
  for better readability?

  5. Do you have any preferences for line opacity or thickness to improve the visualization
  of patterns?

  6. Should we include any additional details such as tooltips or legends for better
  interpretation of the chart?

  7. Are there any attributes that should be highlighted or emphasized more prominently
  than others?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I think line opacity should be such that overlapping lines can still be distinguished,
  but I''m not sure about the exact value.

  6. Yes, please include legends for better interpretation of the chart.

  7. I am not sure.'
