  Create a grouped column chart to illustrate the unique values of different attributes
  in the mushroom classification dataset. Highlight and annotate columns representing
  ''class'', ''cap-shape'', ''odor'', and ''habitat'' based on their unique value
  quantities to help identify key distinguishing features among various categories.
  Emphasize the ''class'' attribute to show the distribution between edible and poisonous
  mushrooms. This visualization will aid in understanding the attributes'' diversity
  and their potential use in distinguishing mushroom types, which is critical for
  biology studies focused on mushroom classification and identification.
