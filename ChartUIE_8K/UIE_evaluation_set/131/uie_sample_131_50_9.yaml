initial_prompt: Please create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize the mushroom
  classification dataset. Highlight differences between edible and poisonous classes.
  Include all features such as cap shape, odor, gill size, and habitat. Ensure the
  chart clearly differentiates between unique values for each feature, making patterns
  and correlations between attributes easily identifiable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for edible and poisonous
  classes?

  2. Would you like each feature to have unique color codings for its values?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order of the features on the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  4. Should the chart include labels or a legend to identify each feature and its
  values?

  5. Do you prefer default line thickness or would you like a specific line thickness
  to enhance clarity?

  6. Do you want any specific feature to be emphasized or highlighted more prominently?

  7. Should the axes for each feature be scaled individually or uniformly?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for specific patterns or
  correlations identified in the data?

  9. Is there a need for a particular font style or size for the text elements in
  the chart?

  10. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the chart?'
