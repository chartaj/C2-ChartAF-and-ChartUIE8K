initial_prompt: I have a dataset on mushroom characteristics with various categorical
  features like cap shape, cap color, odor, and habitat. I'd like to create a box
  plot to visualize the distribution of different attributes, focusing particularly
  on how the different types of mushrooms ('class' column) vary based on attributes
  like 'cap-shape', 'cap-color', 'odor', and 'habitatâ€™. Please prepare a box plot
  for each of these features across the different classes of mushrooms to help identify
  any distinguishing patterns or tendencies between edible and poisonous mushrooms.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the box
  plots?

  2. Would you prefer the box plots to be displayed individually or combined into
  a single multi-panel figure?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box plots (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Would you like the box plots to include data points to show individual observations
  along with the distribution?

  5. Should the box plots include additional statistical indicators such as mean or
  median lines?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the labeling and font size of the axes,
  titles, and legends?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure if they should be displayed individually or combined.

  3. I have no specific preference for the orientation of the box plots.

  4. Yes, it would be helpful to include data points to show individual observations.

  5. Yes, please include mean or median lines in the box plots.

  6. I am not sure about the labeling and font size for the axes, titles, and legends.'
