initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the unique values in each column of
  the mushroom classification dataset. Highlight columns with more unique values in
  a different color to show variability. Use text annotations to describe the significance
  of columns like 'class' (edible/poisonous) and 'odor', as these are crucial for
  identifying mushroom species. The chart should help users quickly identify which
  features have significant variation and are important for classification purposes.
  Adjust bar sizes to distinguish between columns effectively. Add context on how
  these features aid in biological classification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the bars representing high variability to be highlighted (e.g.,
  specific color, pattern)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding and bar sizes?

  5. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the bar chart (e.g.,
  horizontal or vertical bars)?

  6. Do you want the chart to include grid lines for better readability?

  7. Should the text annotations include any additional information besides the significance
  of the features (e.g., number of unique values)?

  8. Are there any particular columns you want to emphasize more prominently in the
  visualization?

  9. Do you prefer a particular style for the axis labels and titles (e.g., bold,
  italicized)?

  10. How detailed should the context on biological classification be (e.g., brief
  notes, comprehensive explanations)?'
