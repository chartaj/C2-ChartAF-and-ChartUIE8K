initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the mushroom classification data. Use
  the columns to show various features like 'cap-shape', 'cap-color', 'odor', and
  'habitat' against 'class' (poisonous or edible). Highlight sections where certain
  features have high correlations with poisonous mushrooms. Add text annotations to
  emphasize key findings, for instance, specific odors linked to poisonous varieties.
  The purpose is to provide a visual summary for quick identification of critical
  features distinguishing edible from poisonous mushrooms, aiding in practical biological
  research and public awareness. Incorporate color scales to show intensity for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred color scales for indicating intensity?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for different classes (poisonous and
  edible)?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (size, font, color)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout or arrangement of the features on the heatmap?

  5. Should significant correlations be highlighted in a particular way (e.g., bold
  borders, specific color)?

  6. Are there any specific key findings you want to emphasize with text annotations?

  7. Do you have any preference for the scale or range of values used in the heatmap?

  8. Is there any additional context or labels you would like to include in the heatmap
  (e.g., titles, subtitles, legends)?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, significant correlations could be highlighted with bold borders.

  6. Specific odors linked to poisonous varieties would be great to emphasize.

  7. I do not know.

  8. A title and a legend would be helpful.
