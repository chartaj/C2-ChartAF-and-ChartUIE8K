initial_prompt: I need a line chart based on the mushroom classification data. Please
  plot the counts of unique values for columns like "cap-shape," "cap-surface," and
  "cap-color" over a sequence representing the dataset entries. This visualization
  will help me understand the distribution of these attributes within the mushroom
  dataset. Make sure the x-axis represents the dataset entries while the y-axis shows
  the count of unique values. This will help me identify patterns or anomalies in
  the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for each attribute?

  4. Should the chart include legends to differentiate between ''cap-shape,'' ''cap-surface,''
  and ''cap-color''?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you want to annotate any specific points or trends in the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis be scaled automatically or set to a fixed range?

  9. Would you like to include markers (e.g., dots) at each data point along the lines?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall chart size or aspect ratio?'
