initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the Mushroom Classification dataset.
  The treemap should illustrate the distribution of mushrooms based on cap-color,
  cap-shape, and odor, with color variations representing different values within
  each category. Use distinct shades for each unique value to ensure clarity. The
  size of each tile should correspond to the frequency of the values within that category
  to show their distribution. Ensure the plot is interactive and displays details
  when hovering over each tile, such as the count of mushrooms with particular features.
  The goal is to identify common patterns and rare attributes visually.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the treemap?

  2. What background color would you like for the treemap?

  3. Should the distribution of mushroom counts be displayed in specific units or
  left as raw counts?

  4. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the labels on the treemap?

  5. Would you like any additional annotation or notes on the treemap to highlight
  certain attributes?

  6. Do you have a specific arrangement preference for the categories within the treemap,
  such as order of importance or alphabetical order?

  7. Are there any particular categories or values you want to emphasize or de-emphasize
  in the visualization?'
