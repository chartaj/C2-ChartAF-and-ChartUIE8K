initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Apple stock data, showing correlations
  between variables like Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume from 1980-12-12
  to the recent date. Add text annotations to highlight specific values and trends
  over time, especially focusing on peak volumes and significant price changes. Use
  highlights to distinguish key periods, such as market highs and lows. The purpose
  is to clearly present stock performance trends and make it easier to identify important
  financial events and anomalies in Apple's historical stock data.

  2. Are there any specific time periods you want to emphasize within the heatmap?

  4. Would you like to include any specific legends or keys to help interpret the
  heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style for highlighting key periods (e.g., shaded areas,
  outlines)?

  6. Are there any specific date ranges you want to exclude from the visualization?

  7. Would you like to see any additional statistical information or metrics alongside
  the heatmap?'
