initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020 that
  shows the correlation between the daily closing prices and the daily trading volumes.
  Ensure that the 'Close' prices are on the y-axis and 'Volume' on the x-axis. Use
  different colors to represent different years so that we can observe trends over
  time. Include labeled axes and a legend for clarity. Make sure missing values are
  handled appropriately. This visual should help us understand how trading volume
  correlates with stock prices over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different years in the
  scatter plot?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be added to the chart for easier reading?

  3. How would you prefer the missing values to be handled (e.g., removed, interpolated)?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style and size of the axis labels and
  legend?

  6. Should the size of the scatter plot markers vary based on any additional variable,
  such as price change or another metric?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or specific data points highlighted
  within the scatter plot?'
