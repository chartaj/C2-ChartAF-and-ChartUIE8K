initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the imports and exports of
  dogs by state. Highlight the states with the highest and lowest totals. Use annotations
  to highlight significant figures, like the top three exported and imported values
  and any notable zero values. The chart should also distinguish between imported
  and exported quantities in each segment. This will help identify trends in the dog
  trade and emphasize key differences between states. Include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme or palette used in
  the chart?

  2. How would you like the top three exported and imported values to be annotated
  in the chart?

  3. Would you prefer specific styles or formats for highlighting states with highest
  and lowest totals?

  4. Do you have any preference on how zero values should be notated?

  5. Is there a specific style you prefer for the legend or placement of the legend?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or text sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?

  7. How would you like the segments for imported and exported quantities to be distinguished
  within each state?'
