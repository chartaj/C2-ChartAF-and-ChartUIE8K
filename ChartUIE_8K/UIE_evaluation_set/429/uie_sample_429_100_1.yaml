initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the import and export of
  dogs by state. Highlight the states with the highest and lowest total numbers of
  dogs traded (both imported and exported). Use different colors to distinguish between
  exported and imported dogs. Annotate significant data points to draw attention to
  notable values, such as those with unusually high or low totals. This will help
  focus attention on key points before examining the entire dataset. Contextual annotations
  should provide insights into trends or patterns observed in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between exported
  and imported dogs?

  2. How would you like the highlights for the states with the highest and lowest
  totals to be represented (e.g., bold text, different colors, shapes)?

  3. What kind of annotations would you prefer for significant data points (e.g.,
  tooltips, labels)?

  4. Would you like any specific contextual information included in the annotations
  for trends or patterns?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the histogram (vertical
  or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for labels and annotations?

  7. Would you like the data points to be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetical
  by state, sorted by total number of dogs traded)?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels or titles on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Labels would be preferred.

  4. Yes, please include insights on any observed trends or patterns.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Sorted by total number of dogs traded would be great.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
