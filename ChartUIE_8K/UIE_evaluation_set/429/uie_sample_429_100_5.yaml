initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map that shows the total number of dogs imported
  and exported by each US state. Use different color gradients to indicate the range
  of values for both imports and exports. Highlight states with missing data. Include
  a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradients representing
  imports and exports?

  2. Would you like the states with missing data to be highlighted with a specific
  color or pattern?

  3. Should the color gradients for imports and exports be based on a specific range
  or automatically calculated from the data?

  4. Do you have any preferred labeling format for the legend (e.g., specific intervals
  or descriptive labels)?

  5. Would you like to include any particular annotations or notes on the map?

  6. Should states with zero imports or exports be visually distinguished from states
  with missing data?

  7. Do you prefer a specific map projection for the choropleth map?

  8. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio for the map that you prefer?'
