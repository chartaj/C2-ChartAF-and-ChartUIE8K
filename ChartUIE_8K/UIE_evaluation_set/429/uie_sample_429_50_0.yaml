initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing dog imports and exports by state.
  Size bubbles by total volume, color by 'inUS', add data-driven annotations to highlight
  most imported locations, and use non-data annotations for context.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color palette preference for the bubbles indicating\
  \ 'inUS' status?\n2. Which font style and size do you prefer for the annotations?\n\
  3. Do you have a preferred layout or format for the data-driven annotations highlighting\
  \ the most imported locations?\n4. Where would you like the non-data annotations\
  \ for context to be placed on the chart?\n5. Is there a specific range or scale\
  \ you prefer for the bubble sizes to represent the total volume? \n6. Would you\
  \ like to have gridlines or axis labels on the chart, and if so, any specific preferences\
  \ for them?\n7. Are there any specific states or locations you want to ensure are\
  \ prominently displayed or annotated? \n8. Do you have a preference for the chart's\
  \ title and subtitle format or content?"
