initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart using the data from the dataset located
  at '../Extra_datas/data/463.csv'. The chart should display the proportion of 'IL
  (25°C)', 'toluene (25°C)', and 'n-heptane (25°C)' concentrations for each sample.
  Use the 'No.' column to identify each data sample in the chart. Each slice of the
  pie should represent the relative percentage of each component per sample. Ensure
  the chart is color-coded for clarity, with a legend that identifies each component.
  This will help visualize the distribution of these chemicals in each sample. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the pie chart slices?

  2. Would you like the pie chart to display the percentages on the slices themselves?

  3. Is there a specific order you would like the data samples to be displayed in?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would prefer for the labels and
  legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for the legend (e.g., position, format)?

  6. Would you like to include the sample numbers (''No.'') in a particular way on
  the pie chart?

  7. Do you prefer the pie chart to be in a 2D or 3D format?'
