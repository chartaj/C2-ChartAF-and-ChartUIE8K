initial_prompt: Please create a box chart comparing distribution of IL (25°C), toluene
  (25°C), and n-heptane (25°C) concentrations.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different concentration distributions
  in the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include specific statistical annotations (mean, median, quartiles)
  on the box chart?

  3. Do you want a particular order for displaying IL, toluene, and n-heptane on the
  x-axis?

  4. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, what should they be?

  5. Would you like to highlight any specific data points or outliers in the chart?

  6. Is there a specific range for the y-axis you wish to set for better visualization
  of the concentration distributions?

  7. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical box plots for this comparison?

  8. Should gridlines be displayed on the chart for easier interpretation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include the median and quartiles.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes. Title: "Comparison of IL, Toluene, and n-Heptane Concentrations at 25°C".
  Axis labels: "Compound" (x-axis) and "Concentration" (y-axis).

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Vertical box plots.

  8. I am not sure.'
