  Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the interaction of different substances
  at 25°C (IL, toluene, n-heptane). Highlight elements to distinguish their concentration
  levels. Annotate significant points to show concentration values. This visualization
  will help in understanding the distribution and comparison of substances in different
  samples, providing clear insights into their proportions. Ensure the chart is clear
  and visually appealing to emphasize data-driven observations for chemistry analysis.

questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  IL, toluene, and n-heptane?

  2. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the stacked bar chart?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  4. Are there any specific concentration threshold values that you want to highlight?

  5. Do you want the concentration values to be displayed inside the bars or at the
  top of the bars?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for annotations and labels?

  7. Are there any specific significant points or samples you want to ensure are annotated?

  8. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned on
  the chart?

  9. Do you prefer any specific order for stacking the substances in the bars?

  1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Samples" and the y-axis as "Concentration (%)".

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Please display the concentration values at the top of the bars.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, annotate any points where the concentration of a substance is above 50%.

  8. Yes, please include a legend, and position it at the bottom right of the chart.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, the overall title should be "Distribution of Substances at 25°C".
