initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the "Favorite Music Genre" distribution
  among different genders from the given dataset. The X-axis should represent the
  music genres, and the Y-axis should represent the count of individuals preferring
  each genre. Use different colored bars to indicate the gender classification (e.g.,
  separate colors for 'F' and 'M'). This will help in understanding the correlation
  between gender and music genre preferences. Ensure the chart is clearly labeled,
  with a legend, and easily readable. Remember, the data is about psychology, so clarity
  is crucial.

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the order of the music genres on the
  X-axis?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the legend placement on the chart?'
