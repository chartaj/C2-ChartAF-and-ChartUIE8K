initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the data focused on "Gender Classification"
  within a psychology context. The heatmap should illustrate the distribution of preferences
  (Favorite Color, Music Genre, Beverage, and Soft Drink) across different genders.
  Additionally, include annotations to highlight interesting data points, especially
  those with high frequency. Use heatmap color variations to accentuate the areas
  with more significant or lesser data points. The intent is to visualize gender-based
  patterns and differences in preferences clearly, aiding in psychological analysis.
  Ensure missing values are irrelevant as there are none in this dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or theme for the heatmap?

  2. Is there a specific range of values you would like the heatmap colors to represent?

  3. How would you like high-frequency data points to be annotated (e.g., specific
  shapes, text labels)?

  4. Do you prefer a certain font style or size for the annotations?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to include a title and axis labels? If so, what should
  they be?

  6. Are there specific colors you prefer to use for highlighting significant areas
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preference for the gridline style or visibility within the heatmap?

  8. Should the gender categories be placed on the x-axis or y-axis?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Text labels would be good for annotating high-frequency data points.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please. The title should be "Gender-Based Preferences Heatmap," and axis
  labels should be "Genders" and "Preferences."

  6. I do not have specific colors in mind for highlighting significant areas.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. The gender categories should be placed on the y-axis.'
