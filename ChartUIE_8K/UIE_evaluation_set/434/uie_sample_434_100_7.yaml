initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that shows the winners of the Tour de France from
  1903 to 2019. Each bar should represent a different winner, with the height corresponding
  to the number of stage wins they achieved. The X-axis should list the winner's names,
  and the Y-axis should represent the number of stage wins. Include labels for the
  winner's team and the competition year. This will help to visualize the most successful
  cyclists and teams over the years. Use different colors to represent different teams.
  Ensure all data is accurately represented and easy to read.

  for each team?
