initial_prompt: 'Create a column chart to visualize Tour de France winners from 1903
  to 2019. The x-axis should display the ''edition'' years, while the y-axis should
  show ''distance''. Each column represents the winner''s distance covered in that
  edition. Color code columns by ''winner_team'' for easy comparison. Highlight missing
  values with a different pattern or color. Include data labels for ''winner_name''
  on each column for better context. Add a legend for teams and include a title "Tour
  de France Winners: Distance Over Years". Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used for the ''winner_team''?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart title and data
  labels?

  3. How would you like missing values to be highlighted (e.g., specific pattern,
  color)?

  4. Should the x-axis labels (edition years) be rotated or formatted in a particular
  way?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the positioning and style of the legend?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the chart? If yes, should they be displayed for
  both axes or only one?

  7. Are there any specific chart dimensions (width, height) you prefer?

  8. Should the y-axis (distance) display any specific units or formatting preferences
  (e.g., comma separators, decimal places)?

  9. Do you prefer any particular arrangement or spacing between the columns?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or comments on specific data points?'
