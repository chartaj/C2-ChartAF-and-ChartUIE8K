initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart visualizing the Tour de France winners
  from 1903 to 2019. The x-axis should represent the edition of the race, and the
  y-axis should represent the winner's age. The size of the bubbles should be proportional
  to the stage wins of each winner, and the bubbles should be colored based on the
  winner's nationality. Include tooltips for winner name, winner team, birth country,
  and time margin. Make sure missing values are handled appropriately.
questions: '1. What color palette or specific colors do you prefer for the different
  nationalities?

  2. Do you have a preference for the shape and style of the bubbles?

  3. Are there any specific labels or fonts you would like to be used for the axes,
  titles, and tooltips?

  4. How would you like the missing values to be handled in the chart?

  5. Should the chart include a legend? If yes, where should it be placed and how
  should it look?

  6. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If yes, any specific style for them?'

  vibrant to differentiate them clearly.

  2. I have no specific preference for the shape and style of the bubbles.

  4. Missing values should be ignored or left blank without compromising the chart''s
  visual integrity.

  5. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure about the placement or look.

  6. I have no specific preference for the background color.
