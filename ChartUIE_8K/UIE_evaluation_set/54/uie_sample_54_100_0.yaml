initial_prompt: Create a histogram that displays the percentage of individuals using
  the Internet by population over the years across different countries. Emphasize
  regions with significant internet adoption and highlight key turning points or significant
  increases in usage. Use text annotations to focus on countries with the highest
  and lowest internet usage in the most recent year. The chart should help visualize
  trends in internet access growth, showing how different regions have progressed
  over time in terms of digital connectivity. Include both text annotations and highlights
  to direct viewers' attention to noteworthy data points.

  3. Are there specific countries or regions you would like to highlight beyond the
  ones with the highest and lowest usage?

  4. Do you prefer any specific typeface or font size for the text annotations?

  5. How granular should the year axis be (e.g., every year, every five years)?

  6. Should there be any additional legends or keys to help interpret the highlighted
  and annotated data?

  7. Do you have a specific preference for the placement of annotations on the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any trend lines to further emphasize changes over time?'
