initial_prompt: I want to visualize the adoption of internet usage over time across
  different countries. Please create a scatter plot using the data provided. Plot
  each countryâ€™s year on the x-axis and the percentage of individuals using the Internet
  on the y-axis. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between countries.
  This will help me see how internet usage has grown globally and identify any trends
  or anomalies among different regions. Additionally, please highlight any notable
  outliers or significant increases in internet adoption within the dataset. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  countries in the scatter plot?

  2. Would you prefer certain marker shapes or styles for different countries?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the axis labels or
  titles?

  4. Do you need any specific annotations or data labels for highlighting notable
  outliers or significant increases in internet adoption?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate countries by color or marker
  style?

  6. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to focus on more prominently
  in the visualization?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or format for the title and subtitles of the scatter
  plot?

  8. Is there a particular range or scale you want to set for the x-axis (year) and
  y-axis (percentage of individuals using the Internet)?
