initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the "Individuals using the Internet (% of
  population)" over the years for various countries. Use the 'Entity' as the y-axis
  and 'Year' as the x-axis, with the percentage values forming the color gradient.
  Highlight missing data points in a separate color. Make sure to clearly label the
  axes and include a legend to interpret the color scale. Based on this, we can analyze
  trends and changes in internet usage across different countries and time periods.
  This will give insights into how internet penetration has evolved globally. Summarize
  key patterns if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the missing data points to be highlighted?

  3. Do you prefer the color gradient to be sequential or diverging?

  4. Should there be any specific labels or annotations on data points with high or
  low internet usage?

  5. Is there a preferred range for the color gradient to represent percentage values?

  6. Are there specific countries or time periods you want to focus on or highlight?

  7. Do you have a font preference for the labels and legend?

  8. Is there a particular way you would like the legend to be formatted or positioned?

  9. Would you like to include additional context or notes within the heatmap to explain
  key patterns?'
