initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the customer acquisition cost
  across different channels. The chart should have customer_id on the x-axis, separated
  by channel categories, and cost on the y-axis. Use text annotations to highlight
  the highest cost values in each channel category to emphasize them for better clarity.
  Additionally, use different colors for each channel to make the chart visually distinct.
  This visualization will help in understanding which channels incur the most cost
  and offer insights for evaluating the customer lifetime value effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different channels?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a title? If so, what should it be?

  3. Would you prefer the text annotations for the highest cost values to be in a
  specific font or style?

  4. Should the x-axis labels (customer_id) be rotated for better readability, and
  if so, at what angle?

  5. Is there a preferred order for displaying the channels on the x-axis, or should
  they be sorted based on the channel list?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines on the chart for better reference, or should
  they be omitted?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for the cost values on the y-axis (e.g.,
  currency symbol, number of decimal places)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to identify the different colors for each
  channel?

  9. Should there be any specific margin or padding preferences around the chart to
  enhance its appearance?'
