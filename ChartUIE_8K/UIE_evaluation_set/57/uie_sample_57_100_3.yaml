initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to visualize customer acquisition channels and
  their effectiveness. On the x-axis, show 'cost', and on the y-axis, show 'revenue'.
  The size of the bubbles should represent 'conversion_rate'. Different colors can
  distinguish the 'channel'. This visualization will help in understanding which channels
  are providing the most revenue and conversions relative to their costs. Make the
  bubbles semi-transparent so that overlapping data points can be better visualized.
  This chart will be crucial for analyzing and better strategizing our marketing spend.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing different
  channels?

  2. Are there any specific ranges or limits you would like to set for the x-axis
  (''cost'') and y-axis (''revenue'')?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  4. Is there a preferred way you would like the legend to be displayed or formatted?

  5. Do you want any specific gridlines or background colors for better readability?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or labels directly on the bubble chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the thickness or styling of the axis lines?'
