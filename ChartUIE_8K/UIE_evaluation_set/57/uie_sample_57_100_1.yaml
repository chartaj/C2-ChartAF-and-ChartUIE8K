initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of revenue across
  different channels. Highlight key data points like the mean and median values of
  revenue, and add text annotations for outliers or notable peaks. Ensure the x-axis
  represents revenue bins, and the y-axis shows the frequency of customers. This visualization
  should help identify which channels yield higher revenue and understand the overall
  revenue distribution. It will support analysis for optimizing customer acquisition
  strategies and budget allocation in different marketing channels. Make the chart
  clear and easy to understand for better data-driven decision-making.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific bin size or number of bins in mind for the revenue distribution?

  3. Where would you like the mean and median values to be highlighted on the histogram
  (e.g., lines, markers)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of text annotations for outliers or notable
  peaks (e.g., font size, color)?

  5. Are there specific channels you want to be distinguished clearly in the visualization?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate revenue distributions by
  different channels?

  7. Do you prefer the use of grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Is there a specific format for labeling the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical metrics to be displayed on the chart?'
