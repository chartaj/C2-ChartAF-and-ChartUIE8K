initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships between N, P, K, temperature,
  humidity, pH, and rainfall across different crops. Highlight specific crops to emphasize
  trends. Add text annotations to focus attention on unique outliers or significant
  data points. Tailor it for agricultural insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific crops you would like to highlight or emphasize?

  3. How would you prefer outliers and significant data points to be annotated (e.g.,
  with arrows, text labels)?

  4. What level of granularity do you want for the text annotations (e.g., numerical
  values, categorical labels)?

  5. Do you have preferences for the layout and orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  size, aspect ratio)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include for the heatmap
  or its axes?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines or borders within the heatmap for better
  clarity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like to highlight rice, wheat, and corn.

  3. With text labels.

  4. Numerical values.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. “Crop Nutrient and Environmental Data” for the title and appropriate labels for
  each axis corresponding to the data variables.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
