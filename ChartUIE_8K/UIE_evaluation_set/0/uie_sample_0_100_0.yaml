initial_prompt: Create a bar chart for the Crop Recommendation Dataset showing average
  N, P, and K levels for different crop labels. Highlight the crops with the highest
  and lowest average N levels. Annotate the highest and lowest average P and K values
  for specific crops. This visualization will help identify nutrient needs for various
  crops, useful for agriculture planning and farming strategies. Use the summary data
  for reference in creating the averages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer a specific typeface or font style for the chart annotations?

  3. How would you like the bars to be organized (e.g., alphabetically by crop label,
  by average N levels, etc.)?

  4. Do you have a preferred way to highlight the highest and lowest average N levels
  (e.g., different color, bold outline)?

  5. How would you like the annotations for the highest and lowest average P and K
  values to appear (e.g., with arrows, boxes, text labels)?

  6. Do you prefer a particular title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include axis labels and if so, what should they specifically
  state?

  8. Is there a preferred format for the legend or would you like to omit it entirely?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. By average N levels.

  4. Different color.

  5. Text labels.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, "Nutrient Levels (N, P, K)" for the y-axis and "Crop Labels" for the x-axis.

  8. I do not know.'
