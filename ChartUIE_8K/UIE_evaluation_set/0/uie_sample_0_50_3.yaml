initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart visualizing the relationship between
  temperature, humidity, and different crop labels from the Crop Recommendation Dataset.
  Each bubble should represent a crop, with its size proportional to the rainfall
  value.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for different crop
  labels?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Would you like to have axis labels and titles on the chart, and if so, do you
  have specific labels in mind?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range for the axis scales?

  5. Should there be a legend explaining the bubble sizes in relation to rainfall
  values?

  6. Do you require any annotations or data labels on the bubbles for enhanced clarity?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the bubble opacity or border style?

  9. Should the bubbles be clustered or spread out to avoid overlap?

  10. Would you like to include reference lines or markers at specific temperature
  or humidity values?'
