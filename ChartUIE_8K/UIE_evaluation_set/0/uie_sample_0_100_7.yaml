initial_prompt: I'm working on an agricultural project and I want to visualize the
  crop distribution based on the 'label' column in my dataset. Could you create a
  pie chart that shows the proportion of different crops present in the data? Please
  ensure each crop has a distinct color and the percentages are displayed on the chart.
  Labels should be clear and the chart should be aesthetically pleasing. This will
  help in understanding the crop diversity in the dataset better. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct colors
  representing each crop?

  2. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the labels on the pie
  chart?

  3. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart, and if so, where would you
  like it positioned?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the overall appearance of the pie
  chart?

  5. Are there any specific crops you want to highlight or draw more attention to
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the font style and size.

  3. Yes, please include a legend. I do not know where it should be positioned.

  4. I have no specific preference for the style or theme.

  5. I do not want to highlight any specific crops.'
