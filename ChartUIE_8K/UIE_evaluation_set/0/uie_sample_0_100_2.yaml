initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualizing the distribution of nitrogen (N), phosphorus
  (P), and potassium (K) levels across different crops. I am interested in seeing
  how these nutrient levels vary for each crop type listed in the dataset. Annotate
  specific crops with notably high or low nutrient levels to highlight these variations.
  Use highlights to differentiate between various crops. This visualization will help
  in comparing the nutrient requirements for different crops, aiding farmers in optimizing
  fertilizer usage. The focus should be on the practical application in agriculture
  and farming.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  various crops?

  2. Are there particular crops you would like to be annotated for high or low nutrient
  levels?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the annotations on the chart?

  4. What level of detail do you want in the highlighting of nutrient levels for different
  crops?

  5. Is there a specific layout or arrangement you prefer for the box chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the highlights and color differentiations?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s title or axis labels?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information or context in the chart,
  such as average nutrient levels or ranges?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include grid lines or background indicators to enhance readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Detailed enough to highlight major differences but not overly cluttered.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. "Nutrient Levels (N, P, K) Across Different Crops"

  8. Yes, including average nutrient levels or ranges would be helpful.

  9. I do not have a specific preference.

  10. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for readability.'
