initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the given dataset with columns 'x'
  and 'y'. Highlight outliers to draw attention to anomalies in the data distribution.
  Apply text annotations to specific data points that deviate significantly from the
  median, emphasizing these exceptions. Use different colors to distinguish between
  the two columns, making the chart visually intuitive. The visualization aims to
  identify data trends and outliers for better data-driven decision-making. This will
  help in quickly spotting any anomalies and understanding the overall data spread
  and variance between 'x' and 'y'.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for distinguishing between the ''x''
  and ''y'' columns?

  2. Are there specific thresholds or criteria you''d like to use to define significant
  deviations from the median for text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or formatting of text annotations (e.g.,
  font size, color, bold)?

  4. Would you like the box chart to include specific statistical measures (e.g.,
  mean, median, quartiles) displayed on the chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the box chart (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles youâ€™d like to include for the axes and
  the chart itself?

  7. Would you like a legend included to explain the colors and annotations used in
  the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferred chart size or aspect ratio requirements?'
