initial_prompt: Visualize the given dataset using a bar chart to predict heart disease.
  The chart should display the counts of unique values in the 'TenYearCHD' column,
  differentiating between those with and without heart disease risk. Highlight the
  bars representing each category to emphasize the data on heart disease prediction.
  Add annotations to the bars with exact counts to draw attention to the values. This
  visualization helps in understanding the heart disease risk distribution. Include
  appropriate labels and a title for clarity. This is useful for health predictions
  using logistic regression.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the bar chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate the
  bars?

  3. Would you like the bars to be horizontal or vertical?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  5. Is there a specific format you would like for the annotations (e.g., plain numbers,
  percentages)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific labels you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Would you like any specific gridlines or background styles for the chart?'
