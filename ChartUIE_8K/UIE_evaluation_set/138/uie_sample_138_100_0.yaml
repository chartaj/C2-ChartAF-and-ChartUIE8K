initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to predict heart disease visualizing 'Age'
  vs. 'TenYearCHD'. Use color highlights to differentiate between males and females
  in the 'male' column. Include annotations to display the 'cigsPerDay' value for
  each age group. This will help in identifying the relationship between age, gender,
  smoking habits, and heart disease risk. Maintain practical visualization by focusing
  on essential data points like age, gender, smoking, and heart disease prediction.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to differentiate
  between males and females?

  2. Would you like the age groups to be displayed in specific ranges or bins?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations displaying the

  4. Should the annotations for the ''cigsPerDay'' values be positioned in a specific

  5. Are there any specific data points or ranges that you want to highlight or emphasize

  data values?

  9. Do you have any requirements for the axis labels and titles (e.g., specific wording,
