initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to predict heart disease using 'age' and 'sysBP'
  from the health dataset. Color points by 'TenYearCHD' and size them by 'BMI'.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different\
  \ values of 'TenYearCHD'?\n2. How would you like the sizes of the points to be scaled\
  \ in relation to 'BMI'? Do you prefer a particular range for point sizes?\n3. Is\
  \ there a preferred shape for the points on the scatter plot?\n4. Do you want to\
  \ include grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?\n5. Would you like\
  \ to add trend lines or regressions to the scatter plot to enhance the correlation\
  \ analysis?\n6. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would like to include?\n\
  7. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?\n8. Should there\
  \ be any annotations or markers for specific data points that represent critical\
  \ values? \n9. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color and size\
  \ encodings? If yes, where should it be positioned?\n10. Are there specific ranges\
  \ or limits you would like to set for the x-axis (age) and y-axis (sysBP)?"
