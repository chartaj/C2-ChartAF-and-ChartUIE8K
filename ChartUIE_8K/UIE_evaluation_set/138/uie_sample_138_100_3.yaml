initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'age', 'cigsPerDay',
  'sysBP', 'diaBP', 'BMI', and 'heartRate' for predicting heart disease over ten years
  using logistic regression. Ensure missing values are handled appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Should we include any specific labels, titles, or annotations on the chart?

  3. Would you like to display any outliers explicitly in the box chart?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like missing values to be handled (e.g., imputation,
  exclusion)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart size or aspect ratio?

  8. Should we include quartile information or summary statistics on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like to be incorporated?

  10. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text elements in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
