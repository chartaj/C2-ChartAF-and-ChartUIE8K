initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the population distribution of countries
  by continent. Include data-driven annotations highlighting 2022 Population values
  for the top 5 populated countries. Use color to distinguish continents and highlight
  countries with the highest growth rates.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing continents?\n\
  2. How do you prefer to highlight the countries with the highest growth rates? (e.g.,\
  \ with a different color, bold outline, etc.)\n3. Would you like the treemap to\
  \ display percentage values in addition to the raw population numbers?\n4. Do you\
  \ have specific font preferences for the annotations?\n5. How detailed should the\
  \ annotations be for the top 5 populated countries? (e.g., only population value\
  \ or additional details like country name and growth rate)\n6. Would you like the\
  \ chart to include a legend explaining the color coding and annotations? \n7. Are\
  \ there any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the treemap?\n\
  8. Do you have any preferences for the border style between different countries\
  \ and continents within the treemap?\n9. Are there any additional labels or markers\
  \ you want included, such as continent names or population density?"
