initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the population growth of different
  countries from 1970 to 2022. Use colors to represent each decade and stack bars
  by country. Include population density and growth rate as labels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing each decade?

  2. How would you prefer to display the population density and growth rate labels
  (e.g., inside the bars, at the top of the bars, as tooltips)?

  3. Are there particular countries you want to focus on, or should the chart include
  all available countries in the dataset?

  4. Do you prefer any specific order in which the countries should be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetically, by population size)?

  5. Should the y-axis be set to a logarithmic scale or a linear scale for population
  numbers?

  6. Would you like to include any specific titles or annotations on the chart to
  emphasize key trends?

  7. Are there any thresholds or benchmarks that you would like highlighted on the
  chart (e.g., significant population milestones)?

  8. Do you want to include a legend for the colors representing each decade, and
  if so, where should it be placed?

  9. Would you like the growth rate to be displayed as a percentage or an absolute
  number?'
