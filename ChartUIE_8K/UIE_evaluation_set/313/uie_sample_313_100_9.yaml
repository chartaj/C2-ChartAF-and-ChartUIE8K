initial_prompt: Create a histogram depicting the population growth over decades for
  different countries and continents. Use the data from '2022 Population', '2020 Population',
  '2015 Population', '2010 Population', '2000 Population', '1990 Population', '1980
  Population', and '1970 Population' columns. Each bar should represent a decade and
  be colored according to the continent for each country. This will help visualize
  the population trends and growth rates over time for each continent and country,
  with clear variations shown. Ensure to label the x-axis with the decades and the
  y-axis with the population count.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the continents?

  2. Do you want a legend included to identify the continents by color?

  3. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  4. Would you like to show gridlines in the background for easier comparison?

  5. How would you prefer the data values to be displayed on the histogram? (e.g.,
  at the top of each bar, as tooltips, etc.)

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the chart labels and
  title?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the histogram?

  8. Do you want the bars to be arranged in a particular order, such as by continent
  or alphabetically by country?

  9. Would you like any particular annotations or highlights on the chart to draw
  attention to specific trends or data points?'
