initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the 2022 population distribution
  across different continents using the provided dataset. Highlight population densities
  and growth rates for each country as key indicators.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., sequential,
  diverging)?

  2. Should each continent be distinctly color-coded or should the color gradient
  represent population density and growth rate?

  3. How would you like to display population density and growth rate for each country
  (e.g., tooltip, labels)?

  4. Should the map include country borders or any specific geo-political boundaries
  for clarity?

  5. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or scale to interpret the color intensities?

  7. Should we add any additional annotations or markers (e.g., capital cities, significant
  landmarks)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the emphasis on either 2022 population, density,
  or growth rate, or should all be given equal importance?

  9. Are there specific continents or countries you want to be highlighted or focused
  on within the map?

  10. Do you require any comparative elements or references to previous years within
  the same heatmap?'
