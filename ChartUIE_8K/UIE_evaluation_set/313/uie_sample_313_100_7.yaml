initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart visualizing the population growth
  of different countries from 1970 to 2022. Use the columns for each decade's population
  data (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2022) on the y-axis. The x-axis
  should represent the countries listed under 'Country/Territory.' Each bar should
  be stacked according to the data for respective decades to show the population distribution
  over the years. Also, differentiate the population from different decades using
  distinct colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the population
  data from different decades?

  2. Would you like to display the exact population numbers on each segment of the
  stacked bars?

  3. Do you have any specific countries that you would like to highlight in the chart?

  4. How would you like the chart to handle countries with missing data for some decades?

  5. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the countries on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  population size, geographical region)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing different
  decades?

  7. Should there be grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to use for the chart
  labels and title?

  9. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, what should
  they be?

  10. Would you like to add any annotations or comments on specific data points or
  trends in the chart?

  11. Do you have a preference for the chart orientation (i.e., vertical or horizontal
  stacked bars)?

  12. Should the y-axis be scaled to start at zero, or should it dynamically adjust
  to the minimum and maximum population values for better visibility of trends?

  13. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as a brief
  description or footnotes, directly on the chart?'
