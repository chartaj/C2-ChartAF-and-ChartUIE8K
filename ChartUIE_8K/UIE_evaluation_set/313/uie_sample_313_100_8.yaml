initial_prompt: Please create an area chart to visualize the population growth over
  time for different countries and continents. Use the data from 1970 to 2022, focusing
  on key populations in different years. Highlight population density and growth rate.
  Make sure the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis shows the population in
  millions. Use different colors to represent different continents for clarity. Label
  each area with its respective country's name. Ensure the chart clearly shows trends
  and differences between continents. Use the World Population Percentage for additional
  context if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for representing different continents?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines or other references on the chart for better
  readability?

  3. How would you like the countries to be labeled—full name or abbreviations?

  4. Are there any specific years you want to emphasize on the x-axis?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  6. Should the population density and growth rate be included as annotations or separate
  visual elements on the chart?

  7. Would you like to use a particular type of area chart (stacked, overlapping,
  etc.)?

  8. Is there any specific ordering of countries or continents that you prefer on
  the chart?

  9. Is there a preferred way for incorporating the World Population Percentage into
  the chart?

  10. Do you want to display data points or markers on the area chart for key populations
  in different years?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.
