initial_prompt: Visualize the population growth trends of Afghanistan, Albania, and
  Algeria from 1970 to 2022 using a line chart. Annotate significant data points,
  such as population spikes or dips, to highlight key changes. Emphasize the continents
  by using different colors for each country. Highlight the overall growth rates and
  world population percentages to provide context. This visualization will help compare
  the trends and growth rates among these countries, helping us understand global
  population dynamics over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for each country?

  2. How would you like the growth rates represented: as a separate graph or within
  the line chart?

  3. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for annotations on significant
  data points?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for easier comparison of data points?

  5. What level of detail do you want in the chart legend?

  6. Should the x-axis be labeled with each decade or every five years?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  8. Should the y-axis be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  9. How should we format the population numbers: in millions, exact numbers, or another
  format?

  10. Is there a preferred range for the y-axis to better visualize the trends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Within the line chart could be useful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Every decade would be fine.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Linear scale would be preferred.

  9. In millions would be easier to understand.

  10. I do not have a specific range in mind.'
