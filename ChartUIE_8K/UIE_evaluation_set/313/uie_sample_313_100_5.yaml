initial_prompt: Please create a population pyramid using the data provided. The pyramid
  should compare population distributions for each age group across different years
  (from 1970 to 2022) for Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria. Ensure the chart clearly
  shows population distribution changes over time by visualizing male and female populations
  separately if possible. Include legends and labels for easy understanding. Use different
  colors for each country and annotate significant changes in population trends. This
  will help analyze demographic shifts and growth rates in these countries. Please
  put in the effort to make it visually appealing and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used for each country?

  2. Would you like to emphasize any specific years or age groups in the visualization?

  3. How detailed should the age group intervals be (e.g., 5-year intervals, 10-year
  intervals)?

  4. Do you have any specific style preferences for legends and labels (e.g., font
  size, font type)?

  5. Should the male and female populations be displayed with specific colors or patterns?

  6. Are there any specific significant changes or events you want us to annotate?

  7. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the population pyramid (e.g.,
  horizontal, vertical)?

  8. How much detail should be included in the annotations explaining population trends?

  9. Are there any additional contextual details you would like to include in the
  visualization (e.g., historical events, policy changes)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please emphasize the years 1990, 2005, and 2020.

  3. 5-year intervals would be ideal.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please annotate significant changes in birth rates or any war impacts.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. Moderate detail in annotations would be good.

  9. I do not know.'
