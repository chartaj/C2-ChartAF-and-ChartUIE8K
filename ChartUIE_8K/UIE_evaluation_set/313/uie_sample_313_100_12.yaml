initial_prompt: I need a Choropleth map showcasing the world population distribution
  by country. Use the latest population data (2022) from the given CSV file. Each
  country should be color-coded based on its population density. Ensure the map includes
  clear legend and labels for better interpretation. Additionally, display the continents
  separately and provide a tooltip that shows detailed information including the growth
  rate and world population percentage when hovering over each country. This visualization
  will help in understanding population distribution and density globally.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or palettes for the choropleth
  map?

  2. How would you like the continents to be visually distinguished from one another?

  3. What specific style or format would you prefer for the legend?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels?

  5. Would you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  6. Is there a particular way you''d like the tooltip to appear (e.g., background
  color, font size, etc.)?

  7. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to highlight or emphasize
  on the map?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the map, such as capitals
  or major cities?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different colors for each continent could work well.

  3. No specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Mercator projection would be fine.

  6. No specific preference.

  7. No, all countries should be treated equally.

  8. I am not sure.'
