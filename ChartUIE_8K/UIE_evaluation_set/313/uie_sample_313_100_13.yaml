initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the distribution of the 2022 population
  across countries. Highlight countries with higher population densities in darker
  colors. The map should show continents distinctly and include labels for country
  names and their respective 2022 populations. Please use the area (km²) and density
  information to create a clear visual representation of population density distribution.
  Also, indicate growth rates using gradient colors for each country to highlight
  regions with significant population changes. Ensure the heatmap is interactive,
  allowing for detailed data on hover.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should there be specific color gradients for different ranges of population density?

  3. Would you like the map to include a legend explaining the color gradients and
  their meanings?

  4. How would you like the country names and their respective 2022 populations to
  be displayed on the map (e.g., tooltips, labels directly on the map)?

  5. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the labels of countries and
  population data?

  6. Would you prefer the map to show additional contextual information, such as country
  borders or major landmarks?

  7. How prominently should growth rates be displayed in comparison to population
  density?

  8. Do you have a preference for the geographic projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)
  used in the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color gradients and their meanings.

  4. I would prefer the country names and their respective 2022 populations to be
  displayed on hover (tooltips).

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. The growth rates should be less prominent than population density.

  8. I do not know.'
