initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the population growth of countries
  in different continents over the years. Use the data from 1970 to 2022 for Afghanistan,
  Albania, and Algeria. Group the bars by country and stack them by decade. Chart
  should show population numbers on the y-axis and years on the x-axis. Include a
  legend indicating each country with different colors. Highlight the continents to
  provide context and ensure each bar section is distinct. Title the chart "Population
  Growth Comparison by Continent (1970-2022)." Include data labels for easy comparison.

  5. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability, or should they be
  omitted?

  6. Do you want to include any specific reference lines or markers (e.g., average
  population, specific year)?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a particular position (e.g., top, bottom, right,
  left)?

  8. Is there a specific order in which the countries and decades should be displayed?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?
