initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart contrasting the 'LCA_Category' and
  'LCA_Category_sub' with 'FAO Match' as the grouped bars. I want to see how different
  LCA Categories and their subcategories match with FAO categories. Make sure to clearly
  label the axes and use different colors for each 'FAO Match' category in the bars.
  Visualize the missing values in 'Gephart Match' as a separate grouped bar to highlight
  data gaps. Note the context of the data is related to fish species from capture
  fisheries and their classification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for each ''FAO Match'' category?

  3. How would you like the ''Gephart Match'' missing values to be represented visually
  in the grouped bars?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order in which ''LCA_Category'' and ''LCA_Category_sub''
  should be displayed?

  5. Should the x-axis or y-axis include any specific labels or annotations beyond
  their title?

  6. Would you like a legend included for the different color categories used in the
  chart?

  7. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels
  and titles?'
