initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart comparing the unique values in the 'LCA_Category_sub'
  column with the count of missing values in the 'Gephart Match' column. This will
  help visualize how the different subcategories of fish (captured) relate to the
  instances where 'Gephart Match' data is missing. Make sure to label each bar clearly
  with the subcategory names and indicate the count of missing values for each. Thank
  you!

  2. What font style and size would you like for the labels?

  3. Should the bars be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the subcategories to be displayed?

  6. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  7. Do you prefer the counts of missing values to be displayed on top of each bar
  or on the axes?

  8. Should there be any specific formatting for the axes (e.g., label orientation,
  font size)?

  9. Do you want to add any annotations or additional information to the chart?'
