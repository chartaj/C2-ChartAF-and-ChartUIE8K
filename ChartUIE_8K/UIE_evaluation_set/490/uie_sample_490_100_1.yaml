initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the distribution of 'LCA_Category' and
  'LCA_Category_sub' for fish matching. Use different colors for each 'LCA_Category'
  and varying shades to distinguish each 'LCA_Category_sub'. Highlight the subcategories
  with unique patterns or border thickness. Annotate notable sections with 'FAO Match'
  values, particularly focusing on those with missing 'Gephart Match' values. This
  chart aims to emphasize the diversity within fish categories and subcategories,
  helping to identify areas with incomplete data. Ensure annotations are clear, drawing
  attention to any unique patterns or insights revealed by the data distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating ''LCA_Category''?

  2. How would you like the varying shades for ''LCA_Category_sub'' to be determinedâ€”by
  a gradient or distinct colors?

  3. Are there specific border thickness or pattern styles you prefer for highlighting
  the subcategories?

  4. Do you want to include legends to explain the color and shading scheme used in
  the Treemap?

  5. Would you prefer the annotations for ''FAO Match'' values to be inside or outside
  the Treemap sections?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be for the sections with missing ''Gephart
  Match'' values?

  7. Is there a specific font type or size you prefer for the annotations to ensure
  readability?

  8. Are there any additional highlights or markers you would like to use for unique
  patterns or insights?

  9. Would you like the plot to focus on specific ''LCA_Category'' and their subcategories
  or provide an overall view?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the aspect ratio or sizing of the Treemap
  to accommodate the annotations and highlights?'
