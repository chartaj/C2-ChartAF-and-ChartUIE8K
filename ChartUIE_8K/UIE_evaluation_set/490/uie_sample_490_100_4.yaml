initial_prompt: I have some data regarding the matching of fish categories, subcategories,
  and their corresponding matches in Gephart and FAO databases. I want to visualize
  this data using a donut chart. Each segment should represent the unique values in
  the 'LCA_Category', 'LCA_Category_sub', 'Gephart Match', and 'FAO Match' columns,
  with the size of each segment corresponding to the count of entries for each unique
  value. Additionally, highlight missing values in a distinctive way. Please make
  sure the chart is labeled clearly and easy to interpret!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the donut chart?

  2. How would you prefer missing values to be highlighted (e.g., particular color,
  pattern)?

  3. Do you want a legend to be included for each category and subcategory?

  4. Should segment labels display the count of entries or the percentage?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Should we include a title for each section of the donut chart? If yes, please
  specify.

  7. Do you want the chart to display in a specific order (e.g., largest to smallest
  segment)?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like apart from missing
  values?

  9. Should we include any additional text or descriptive notes along with the chart?

  10. Do you prefer specific segment separation (gap) to distinguish between data
  categories?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Highlight missing values using a distinct color, perhaps red or a pattern.

  3. Yes, include a legend for each category and subcategory.

  4. Segment labels should display the count of entries.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. No specific preferences for titles for each section.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, just highlight the missing values.

  9. No additional text or descriptive notes are needed.

  10. I am not sure.
