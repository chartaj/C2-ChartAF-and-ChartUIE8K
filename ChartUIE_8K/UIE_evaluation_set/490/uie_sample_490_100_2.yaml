initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the categorization of fish species from
  the dataset, focusing on the 'LCA_Category_sub' column against 'FAO Match'. Annotate
  the cells with the count of occurrences where 'Gephart Match' is missing to highlight
  the discrepancies in data matching. This visualization aims to emphasize areas with
  missing 'Gephart Match' data, helping to identify specific fish categories with
  data gaps. Use varying shades to indicate frequency, and annotate the most and least
  common categories for a clear overview. This will help in understanding the data
  distribution and identifying focus areas for further research.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?\n2. Would you\
  \ like a specific range for the varying shades to indicate frequency?\n3. How would\
  \ you like the missing 'Gephart Match' data to be annotated in the cells?\n4. Do\
  \ you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations?\n5. Should the heatmap\
  \ include a legend for better understanding of the frequency shading?\n6. Is there\
  \ a particular layout preference you have for the heatmap (e.g., vertical or horizontal\
  \ label orientation)?\n7. Do you need any specific axis labels or titles to be included\
  \ in the heatmap?\n8. Are there any additional details or information you would\
  \ like to have included in the annotations for the most and least common categories?\n\
  9. Would you like gridlines or borders around the cells to be visible? \n10. Is\
  \ there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?"
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I''d like the missing ''Gephart Match'' data to be annotated with an asterisk
  (*) and the count.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend for better understanding of the frequency
  shading.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include axis labels and a title: "Fish Species Categorization Heatmap".

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I do not have a specific size or aspect ratio preference.'
