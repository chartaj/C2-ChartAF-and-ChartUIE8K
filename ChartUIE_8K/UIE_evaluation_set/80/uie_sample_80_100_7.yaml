initial_prompt: Please create a Donut chart visualizing the BMI Category distribution
  from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. I want to see the proportion of people
  in each BMI category, such as Normal, Overweight, etc., to understand how different
  BMI categories are represented in the dataset. Make sure to label each section of
  the Donut chart with the BMI category name and percentage. This will help in analyzing
  the prevalence of different BMI categories in relation to sleep and lifestyle factors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Donut chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display both the category name and percentage inside
  the segments or outside with callouts?

  3. Should the chart have a legend in addition to the labels on the segments?

  4. Is there a specific order you''d prefer the BMI categories to be displayed in
  (e.g., ascending, descending, custom)?

  5. Do you want the chart title to reflect the specific focus on sleep and lifestyle
  factors, or a more general title on BMI distribution?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or stylistic preferences you would like for the
  labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color scheme.

  2. I would like the chart to display both the category name and percentage inside
  the segments.

  3. I am not sure if a legend is needed in addition to the labels.

  4. I do not know about the specific order for the BMI categories.

  5. A more general title on BMI distribution is fine.

  6. I have no specific preference for fonts or stylistic preferences for the labels
  and title.'
