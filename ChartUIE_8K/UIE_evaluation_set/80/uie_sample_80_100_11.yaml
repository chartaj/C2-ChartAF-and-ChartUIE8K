initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to analyze the relationship between physical
  activity level, quality of sleep, and stress level from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle
  Dataset. Each bubble should represent an individual's data with the x-axis showing
  the physical activity level, the y-axis representing the quality of sleep, and the
  bubble size indicating the stress level. Use different colors to differentiate the
  BMI categories. Highlight any bubbles with missing values in the sleep disorder
  field. This will help visualize how lifestyle factors influence sleep health.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the BMI categories?

  2. How would you like missing values in the sleep disorder field to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific color, border style)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size range of the bubbles to indicate stress
  level?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color codes for BMI categories
  and indications for missing values?

  5. Do you prefer any specific labels or titles for the x-axis, y-axis, and the entire
  chart?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability, and
  if so, in what style?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and chart title?

  8. Do you want any specific tooltips or data labels to appear when hovering over
  the bubbles?

  9. Should the chart include a background or specific theme for visual appeal?

  10. Would you like to set a specific range or scale for the x-axis and y-axis?'
