initial_prompt: Create a box plot using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset to
  visualize the distribution of sleep duration across different occupations. Highlight
  significant outliers and annotate the median sleep duration value for each occupation.
  The chart should help to understand how different jobs impact sleep duration. Use
  different colors to distinguish the occupations clearly. Make sure the plot is visually
  appealing and easy to understand. Include data-driven text annotations for key elements
  to draw attention to important findings. This visualization will aid in comparing
  occupational impacts on sleep health.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing different
  occupations?

  2. Would you like a particular style or format for the annotations on the median
  sleep duration values?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you prefer for the data-driven text
  annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size or scaling of the box plot?

  5. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles on the chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout or organization of the chart elements
  (e.g., legend placement, axis labels)?

  7. Would you like the outliers to be represented with specific markers or symbols?

  8. Are there any additional elements or features you would like to include to enhance
  the chart''s readability or visual appeal?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the style or format for the annotations on the median sleep
  duration values.

  3. I do not know any specific fonts or text styles for the data-driven text annotations.

  4. I do not have a preference for the size or scaling of the box plot.

  5. Yes, please include a title such as "Sleep Duration Distribution Across Various
  Occupations" and appropriate axis labels.

  6. I do not have any specific preferences for the layout or organization of the
  chart elements.

  7. Yes, please use distinct markers or symbols to represent the outliers.

  8. I do not know of any additional elements or features to include.'
