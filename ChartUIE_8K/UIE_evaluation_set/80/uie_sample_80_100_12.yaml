initial_prompt: Create a bar chart for the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. I need
  the x-axis to represent different occupations and the y-axis to show the average
  sleep duration. Make sure each bar represents a different occupation. Add a legend
  to indicate male and female categories using different colors for clarity. Ensure
  the chart title is "Average Sleep Duration Across Occupations". Include data labels
  on each bar for a better overview. Please ensure the chart looks professional and
  easy to interpret. Incorporate gridlines for better readability. Thank you!

  2. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like for the chart title and
  labels?

  3. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical gridlines, or both?

  places, units)?

  5. Are there any specific occupations or categories you want to highlight?

  6. Is there a specific orientation for the bar chart (vertical bars vs. horizontal
  bars) that you prefer?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement of the legend (e.g., top,
  bottom, right, left)?
