initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the Internet Penetration Rate against
  the Smartphone Penetration Rate by country. Annotate specific countries like India,
  USA, and Brazil to highlight their respective rates. Use text annotations to display
  the penetration rates for these countries. Make sure the countries stand out by
  using different colors or sizes for the markers. The purpose of this visualization
  is to easily compare and understand the relationship between internet and smartphone
  penetration rates across different countries. This will be useful for technology
  and market researchers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different countries or specific
  countries like India, USA, and Brazil?

  2. Would you prefer different marker shapes to differentiate the highlighted countries?

  3. What size should the markers be for default countries and highlighted countries?

  4. Do you have a preference on the font size and style for the text annotations
  displaying the penetration rates?

  5. Should there be any particular axis labels or titles used for clarity?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or background patterns in the scatter plot?

  7. Is there any specific legend format or position you prefer for the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the highlighted countries (e.g., positions
  or clustering on the plot)?'
