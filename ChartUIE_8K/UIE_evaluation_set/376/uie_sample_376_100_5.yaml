initial_prompt: 'I need a grouped bar chart to visualize the internet and smartphone
  penetration rates by country. The x-axis should display countries, and the y-axis
  the percentage rates. Each country should have two bars: one for internet penetration
  and one for smartphone penetration, placed side by side. The chart should include
  a legend differentiating between internet and smartphone penetration. Furthermore,
  it should be clearly titled and labeled. Please ensure the data is accurately represented,
  with different colors for the internet and smartphone penetration bars for easy
  comparison.'

  penetration bars?

  the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart for context or
  explanation?

  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by penetration rate)?
