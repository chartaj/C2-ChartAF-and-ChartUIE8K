initial_prompt: I have monthly temperature data for Amherst and I want to visualize
  the highest temperatures recorded each month. Please create a column chart where
  the x-axis represents the months (from January to December) and the y-axis shows
  temperature values. Each column should display the highest temperature for the corresponding
  month. I need the temperature values on the y-axis to range appropriately based
  on the data provided. The chart should be clear and easy to understand, reflecting
  the temperature trends over the months in Amherst. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the columns or background of
  the chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the labels on the x-axis (months)
  and y-axis (temperature values)?

  4. Should there be a title for the chart? If so, do you have a preference for the
  text of the title?

  5. Would you like to add data labels on top of each column to show the exact temperature
  values?

  6. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart
  (e.g., axis labels, title)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, even if there''s only one data series?

  8. Are there any specific temperature ranges you would like to highlight on the
  y-axis with different colors or markers?

  9. Should the months on the x-axis be shown in an abbreviated form (e.g., Jan, Feb)
  or in full (e.g., January, February)?

  10. Do you have a preference for the format in which the highest temperature value
  is displayed (e.g., with or without decimal points)?'
