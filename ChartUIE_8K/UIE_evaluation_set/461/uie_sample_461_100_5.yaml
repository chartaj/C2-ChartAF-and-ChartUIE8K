initial_prompt: Please create a box plot chart to visualize the monthly highest temperatures
  in Amherst using the data from the file provided. The x-axis should represent the
  months of the year, ranging from January to December. The y-axis should show the
  temperature values. Ensure that each box in the plot displays the distribution of
  temperatures for that month across different years captured in the dataset. This
  will help in understanding the variations and patterns in temperature for each month.

  plots?

  or specific months?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines to help with reading the values?
