initial_prompt: I need a column chart visualizing the highest monthly temperatures
  in Amherst from 2004. The x-axis should represent the months, and the y-axis should
  show the temperatures in Fahrenheit. Highlight temperature trends over the months.
  Use the provided data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  for each month?

  4. Would you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have a specific style or font preference for the axis labels and title?

  6. Should we include data labels on each column to display the exact temperature
  values?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included on the chart, even though it shows a single
  data series?

  to highlight specific points or trends?'
