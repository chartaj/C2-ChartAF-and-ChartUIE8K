initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the monthly highest temperatures
  in Amherst for the year 2004. Highlight the temperature values to emphasize the
  highest and lowest months. Include text annotations for the February and March temperatures
  to focus attention on these specific points. The purpose is to visualize temperature
  variations across months, helping to identify patterns and extremes. Non-data-driven
  annotations for context on the x-axis (months) and y-axis (temperature) would be
  valuable. This visualization is intended for weather analysis and trend recognition
  over the specified period.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the highest
  and lowest temperature months?

  2. Which font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations for February
  and March temperatures?

  3. Would you like any grid lines on the chart? If so, in which style (dotted, dashed,
  solid)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the x-axis and y-axis labels and annotations?

  5. How would you like the x-axis (months) and y-axis (temperature) to be labeled?
  Any specific text or format?

  6. Do you want the histogram bars to be displayed in a specific color scheme?

  7. Would you prefer any specific format for the tooltip text for the data points,
  if applicable?

  8. Are there any additional elements (e.g., legends, titles) you would like included
  in the visualization?

  9. Could you provide guidance on how detailed the non-data-driven annotations for
  context should be?'
