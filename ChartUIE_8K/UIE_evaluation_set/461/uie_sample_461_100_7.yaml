initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the monthly highest temperatures
  in Amherst. Use the data provided, which includes columns for Year, Date, and Temperature.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the months, and the y-axis represents the years. Each
  cell in the heatmap should reflect the highest temperature recorded for that specific
  month and year combination. The color intensity should indicate the temperature,
  with a gradient from cool to warm colors to easily identify trends and anomalies.
  This visualization will help in understanding temperature patterns over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradient preferences for cool to warm
  colors?

  2. What range of years would you like to display on the y-axis?

  3. Would you like to display the exact temperature values within each cell, or just
  rely on color intensity?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you prefer the months on the x-axis to be displayed as numbers or abbreviated
  names (e.g., Jan, Feb, etc.)?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or markings you would like to include to highlight
  anomalies or significant trends?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the heatmap?

  8. Would you prefer any specific text or labels for the color legend?

  9. Are there any specific margins, padding, or aspect ratio preferences for the
  heatmap?

  cells?'
