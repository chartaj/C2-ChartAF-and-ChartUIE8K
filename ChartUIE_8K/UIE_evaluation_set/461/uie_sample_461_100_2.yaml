initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the highest monthly temperatures in Amherst
  for the year 2004. Highlight the month with the highest temperature in a distinct
  color. Add data-driven text annotations for the highest and lowest temperatures
  to draw attention. Use the summary to ensure data accuracy, labeling the x-axis

  focusing on temperature extremes for quick insights.
