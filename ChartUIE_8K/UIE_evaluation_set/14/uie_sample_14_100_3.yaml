initial_prompt: 'I need a stacked bar chart that shows the median values of different
  taxa for each stressor and source category. The x-axis should represent the different
  taxa (bivalves, catfish, hypoph_carp), and the y-axis should show the median values.
  Each bar should be color-coded to represent different stressors (GHG) and should
  be divided into sections representing different sources (total on- and off-farm).
  Add appropriate labels, legends, and a title to make the chart clear. Data source:
  fish_env_info, zoology.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different stressors?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color palette for differentiating the sources within
  each bar?

  3. What title would you like for the chart?

  4. Are there any specific labels you would like on the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetically
  by taxa, by median values)?

  7. Is there any specific font style or size you would like for the labels and title?

  8. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Would you like any specific annotations or data values displayed directly on
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. "Median Values of Different Taxa by Stressor and Source"

  4. X-axis: "Taxa", Y-axis: "Median Values"

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  9. I am not sure.'
