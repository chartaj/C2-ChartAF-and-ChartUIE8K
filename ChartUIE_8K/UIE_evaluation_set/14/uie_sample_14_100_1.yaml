initial_prompt: Visualize a scatter plot using 'median' on the Y-axis and 'full_taxa_name'
  on the X-axis. Highlight 'taxa' differences with varying colors. Annotate data points
  for key stressors like 'GHG' to emphasize their impact. This chart will help in
  comparing the environmental median values for different taxa and identify key stressors
  affecting each group. It will be useful for environmental impact studies within
  the field of zoology, focusing on aquaculture production methods' ecological impacts.
  Ensure missing values are handled appropriately and labels are clear for better
  insight.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating ''taxa''?

  2. Would you like to use specific shapes or sizes for the data points?

  3. Is there a particular annotation style you prefer for highlighting key stressors
  like ''GHG''?

  4. Do you require specific labels or annotations for the axes?

  5. Should we include gridlines or any other background elements for better readability?

  6. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the handling of missing values, such as imputation
  methods or omitting data points?

  8. Should the scatter plot include error bars to represent variability, such as
  ''lower_95'' and ''upper_95'' values?

  9. Are there any additional legends or keys that you would like included in the
  scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Clear and concise labels for the axes would be appreciated.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Please omit the data points with missing values.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
