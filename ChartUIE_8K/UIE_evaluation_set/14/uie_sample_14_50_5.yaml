initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the median values across different taxa and
  stressors. Use 'taxa' and 'stressor' as x and y axes, respectively. Highlight variations
  in 'median' values using color gradient.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme or gradient for highlighting
  the variations in ''median'' values?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the range of values to be represented by
  the color gradient?

  3. Would you like to include any labels or annotations on the heatmap to indicate
  specific data points or high/low variations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the x-axis (taxa) and
  y-axis (stressor) labels?

  5. Do you require any additional elements like a legend or title to be included
  in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like any gridlines or separators between the cells of the heatmap to
  enhance readability?

  7. Are there any specific taxa or stressors that you would like to emphasize or
  have highlighted differently on the heatmap?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and annotations within
  the heatmap?

  9. Should outliers or missing data be treated in a particular way in the heatmap?'
