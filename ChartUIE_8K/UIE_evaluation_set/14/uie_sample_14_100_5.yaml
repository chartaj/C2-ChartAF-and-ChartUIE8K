initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap using the provided data to visualize the
  median values of environmental stressors (GHG) across different taxa in aquaculture
  production. Utilize the ''median'' column for color intensity, and place ''taxa''
  on one axis and ''stressor'' on the other. Exclude columns with missing data. Highlight
  how different taxa contribute to environmental impacts. Title the heatmap: "GHG
  Emissions by Taxa in Aquaculture". Ensure the color scale represents the range of
  median values effectively for clear visual comparison.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What should be the range of the color scale for the median values?

  3. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the heatmap?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the title and axis
  labels?

  5. Do you want the color scale to be discreet or continuous?

  6. Are there any specific taxa or stressors you want to highlight or differentiate
  in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Continuous color scale.

  6. I am not sure.'
