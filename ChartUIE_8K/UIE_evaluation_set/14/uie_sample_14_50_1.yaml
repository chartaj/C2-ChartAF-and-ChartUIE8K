initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the median values of different taxa
  under the GHG stressor from aquaculture. Highlight bivalves, catfish, and hypoph_carp
  data points, and provide text annotations for their median values to emphasize differences.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the highlighted taxa to be differentiated by color, shape, or
  both?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations to be placed relative to the data
  points (e.g., above, below, left, or right)?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Do you want to add titles for the axes and the overall chart? If yes, please
  specify the titles.

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the highlights for bivalves, catfish,
  and hypoph_carp?

  8. Should there be any specific range for the axes to better visualize the differences
  in median values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Both.

  3. Above.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, "Median Values of Taxa under GHG Stressor from Aquaculture" for the overall
  chart, "Taxa" for the x-axis, and "Median Values" for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes.

  8. I do not know.'
