  Please create a scatter plot for the dataset found in ''../Extra_datas/data/15.csv''.
  I want to visualize the relationship between ''x.1'' and ''y.1''. Since ''x.2'',
  ''y.2'', ''z.1'', and ''z.2'' have minimal variability and mostly zeros, they should
  be excluded from the scatter plot. Kindly ensure that the axes are labeled appropriately,
  and the plot has a title "Scatter Plot of x.1 vs y.1". It should also reflect any
  patterns or correlations between these variables clearly.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color for the data points in the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the data points to have specific shapes or sizes?

  3. Should the scatter plot include a trend line or regression line to help illustrate
  the correlation?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axes labels and title?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot? If so, should they be in a specific
  style or color?

  6. Would you like the scatter plot to include any annotations, such as labeling
  specific data points or adding notes?

  7. Are there any specific axes limits or scales you prefer (e.g., logarithmic scale,
  custom range)?

  8. Should the plot include a legend, and if so, what information would you like
  it to contain?'
