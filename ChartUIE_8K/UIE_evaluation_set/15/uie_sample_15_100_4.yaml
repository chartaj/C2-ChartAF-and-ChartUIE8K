initial_prompt: I need a box plot for data in ../Extra_datas/data/15.csv. Visualize
  columns x.1, y.1, and z.1. Each of these columns should be in separate boxes on
  the same plot. This is for a data science project on analyzing pattern distributions.
  Highlight outliers and any key statistical information like median, quartiles, and
  any potential anomalies. Include axis labels for better interpretation and ensure
  the plot is clean and easy to understand. Also, please provide a summary of key
  insights derived from the box plot. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the boxes or outliers?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included in the plot for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the columns x.1, y.1, and z.1 on the plot?

  4. Should the axis labels include units or any particular format?

  5. Are there any specific threshold values for anomalies that you want to highlight?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of the plot title?

  7. Would you like the summary of key insights to be included directly on the plot
  or as a separate text?'
