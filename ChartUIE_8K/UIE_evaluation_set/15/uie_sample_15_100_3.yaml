initial_prompt: I need a radar chart to visualize data from `15.csv`. Include variables
  `x.1`, `x.2`, `y.1`, `y.2`, `z.1`, and `z.2`. Plot the average values for these
  columns. Ensure the radar chart displays each variable on its own axis for clarity.
  Use data-specific labels and colors to differentiate variables. Keep chart interactive
  if possible for data exploration. The chart must be insightful for overview and
  anomaly detection. Use it to assist with Klein Bottle data-science-and-analytics
  project's exploratory data analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating the variables?

  2. Do you want gridlines on the radar chart for better readability?

  3. What labels or annotations would you prefer on the chart axes?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the radar chart include a legend to identify each variable?

  6. What level of detail would you like for hover tooltips (e.g., displaying exact
  average values)?

  7. Do you want the chart to be displayed with a specific background color or theme?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend to identify each variable.

  6. I am not sure about the level of detail for hover tooltips.

  7. I do not have a specific background color or theme in mind.'
