initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the occurrence and distribution of unique
  words used by different artists over several eras. On the x-axis, have the different
  eras ('2010s', '1990s', etc.), and on the y-axis, list the rapper names. The cell
  values should represent the number of unique words used by each artist within that
  specific era. Use color intensity to represent the count, with darker shades for
  higher counts. Ensure that missing values are represented and include a legend explaining
  the color scale. This will help analyze trends and patterns in lyrical diversity
  over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific shades or color schemes you want to avoid?

  3. Should the color scale be linear or logarithmic?

  4. Do you want to include labels showing the exact count of unique words on the
  heatmap cells?

  5. How would you like missing values to be represented (e.g., a specific color,
  a symbol)?

  6. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights for certain eras or rappers?

  8. Should the chart have a title or subtitle, and if so, what should it be?

  9. Would you like gridlines to separate the cells, and if so, should they be more
  prominent or subtle?

  10. Do you prefer the heatmap to be of a certain dimension or aspect ratio?'
