initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of unique words used
  by different rappers from the 1990s and 2010s. Use text annotations to highlight
  the average number of words per rapper and any significant outliers. Apply color
  highlights to distinguish between decades for clearer comparison. Add a brief summary
  to provide context on how language styles might have evolved. The purpose is to
  analyze and compare linguistic diversity in rap lyrics across different eras, shedding
  light on cultural and artistic shifts in the hip-hop industry.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between the
  1990s and 2010s?

  2. What style of text annotations would you prefer for highlighting the average
  number of words per rapper and significant outliers? (e.g., font size, font type)

  3. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the histogram (e.g.,
  vertical bars, horizontal bars)?

  4. How detailed do you want the brief summary context to be? Should it include specific
  examples, historical context, or just a general overview?

  5. Do you have a preference for the histogram bin width or specific ranges of unique
  words?

  6. Would you like any additional statistical measures besides the average (e.g.,
  median, mode) displayed on the chart?

  7. Should the labels for rappers and eras be displayed in any specific format?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Vertical bars would be best.

  4. A general overview would suffice.

  5. I don''t know.
