initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the total words used by each rapper across
  different eras. Highlight the rappers with the highest and lowest word counts. Annotate
  the bars with their exact word counts to draw attention to differences. The purpose
  of this visualization is to analyze lyrical verbosity across various time periods
  and artists, providing insights into trends and variances in rap lyrics. This will
  help in understanding how lyrical complexity and stylistic approaches have evolved
  within the music industry. Provide text annotations for any significant outliers
  or trends noted.
