initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the data from the provided
  CSV file. Use the 'time' column for the x-axis and the 'signal' column for the y-axis.
  Since this dataset appears to contain time-series data without any missing values,
  the scatter plot should help in visualizing any patterns or trends over time. Ensure
