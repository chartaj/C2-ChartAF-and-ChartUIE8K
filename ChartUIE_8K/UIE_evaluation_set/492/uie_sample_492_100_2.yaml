initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the data from the time and signal
  columns. The chart should emphasize the distribution and variability of the signal
  over time. Make sure to highlight any outliers within the data, as these may indicate
  anomalies. I would like text annotations to display key statistics like the median,
  quartiles, and any prominent outliers. The annotations should help in understanding
  the central tendencies and spread of the data. Use different colors to highlight
  the quartiles to make the chart visually appealing and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the quartiles
  in the box chart?

  2. Would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted with a specific marker style
  or color?

  3. How detailed would you like the text annotations to be (e.g., just the median
  and quartiles, or additional statistics like mean or standard deviation)?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Are there any specific time ranges or signal value ranges you would like to focus
  on within the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a grid or background pattern for better readability
  of the data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences for the quartiles.

  2. I would prefer the outliers to be highlighted with a distinct marker style or
  color.

  3. Just the median and quartiles should be fine for text annotations.

  4. I do not have any specific font style or size preferences for the annotations.

  5. I do not know if there are specific time or signal value ranges to focus on.

  6. I am not sure about including a grid or background pattern.'
