initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of the 'signal' data
  over 'time.' Highlight data points at specific intervals. Use text annotations to
  identify key trends and outliers. Aim to understand signal variability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart and highlighted
  data points?

  2. Are there specific time intervals at which you want to highlight data points?

  3. How would you like the key trends and outliers to be annotated? (e.g., arrows,
  labels, different colors)

  4. Should the box chart include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Are there any additional statistical measures or summary statistics you want
  to be displayed on the chart?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, what should they
  be?

  7. Would you like any reference lines or markers to be added, such as median, mean,
  or quartiles?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the box chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal)?

  9. How much detail do you want in the text annotations? (e.g., simple labels, detailed
  descriptions)

  10. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, what information should it convey?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. At intervals of every 10 units of time.

  3. I am not sure.

  "Signal."

  7. Yes, reference lines for the median and quartiles.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Simple labels.

  10. I am not sure.'
