initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset with time-series data, involving two columns: time
  and signal, both consisting of floating-point numbers. Refer to the summary and
  sample data provided to plot the chart. I want a line chart that shows how the signal
  changes over time. The x-axis should represent the time in seconds (time column),
  and the y-axis should illustrate the corresponding signal values (signal column).
  Please ensure the line chart accurately reflects the signal''s trend throughout
  the entire time range, making it easy to analyze any variations or patterns in the
  signal.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color of the line?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart?

  3. Should the chart have data point markers (e.g., dots) along the line?

  4. Do you need any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific ranges, or should they be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  8. Do you want a legend, even though there is only one line representing the signal?

  9. Are there any specific formats you prefer for the time axis (e.g., displaying
  time in milliseconds, seconds, or a custom format)?

  10. Should there be any custom formatting for the y-axis signal values (e.g., decimal
  places, scientific notation)?

  11. Do you prefer a solid line, dashed line, or another style for the line?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include gridlines in the chart.

  3. I am not sure about the data point markers.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please title it "Signal Variation Over Time".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. The ranges should be automatically determined based on the data.

  8. No, I do not need a legend.

  9. Display time in seconds.

  10. I do not know.

  11. A solid line is preferred.'
