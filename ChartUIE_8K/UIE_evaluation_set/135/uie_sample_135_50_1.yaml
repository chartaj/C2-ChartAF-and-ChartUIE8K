initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between `radius_mean`
  and `area_mean` for breast cancer diagnosis. Highlight malignant (M) and benign
  (B) points with different colors. Add annotations to emphasize outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting malignant (M)
  and benign (B) points?

  2. Would you prefer specific marker shapes for the different diagnosis categories
  (e.g., circles for benign and squares for malignant)?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be annotated? (e.g., with labels, arrows,
  or specific marker styles)

  4. Do you have a preference for the axis ranges or should they be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  5. Should the plot include a legend to explain the colors and markers used for malignant
  and benign categories?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed in the background of the scatter plot?

  7. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and annotations?

  8. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot or should one be generated
  automatically?

  9. Should the scatter plot include trend lines or regression lines to further illustrate
  the correlation?

  10. Are there any specific data points you wish to emphasize or keep track of on
  the scatter plot?'
