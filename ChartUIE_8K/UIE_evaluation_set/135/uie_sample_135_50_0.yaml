initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of radius_mean, texture_mean,
  and perimeter_mean for different diagnosis groups. Highlight and annotate the medians
  to easily compare between M (Malignant) and B (Benign).
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different diagnosis groups
  (M and B)?

  2. Do you have any preferred layout for the box charts (e.g., grouped horizontally
  or vertically)?

  3. Would you like the medians to be annotated with a specific style (e.g., color,
  size, or shape of the marker)?

  4. How would you like outliers to be displayed or highlighted, if at all?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for easier comparison of values across different
  groups?

  6. What font style and size do you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you want for the chart?

  8. Would you like the axes to be fixed or dynamically adjusted based on the data?

  9. Should the chart include a legend explaining the diagnosis groups?

  10. Do you prefer any specific border style or thickness for the boxes in the box
  chart?

  11. Would you like to include any specific notes or annotations related to the data
  on the chart?'
