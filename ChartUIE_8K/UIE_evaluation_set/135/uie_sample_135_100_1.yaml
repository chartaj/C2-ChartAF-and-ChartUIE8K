initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
  Data Set to visualize the relationship between 'radius_mean' and 'texture_mean'.
  Highlight data points where 'diagnosis' is 'M' in red and 'B' in green. Annotate
  three data points with the highest 'radius_mean', mentioning their corresponding
  'id'. The purpose of this visualization is to observe any distinguishable patterns
  between malignant and benign tumors in terms of their size and texture. This can
  help in understanding the features associated with different diagnoses. Provide
  proper labels and a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any preference for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  3. What size and style of font should be used for the annotations?

  4. Would you like the data points to be of a specific shape or size?

  5. Do you have a preference for the legend''s location on the chart?

  6. Should there be grid lines in the background of the scatter plot?

  7. Do you want any specific range for the x-axis and y-axis values?

  8. Is there a particular style or color theme you would like to follow for the overall
  chart?'
