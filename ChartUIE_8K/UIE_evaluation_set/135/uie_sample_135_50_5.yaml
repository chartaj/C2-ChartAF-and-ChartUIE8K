initial_prompt: Create a spline chart that visualizes the mean texture and smoothness
  against the mean radius of breast cancer tumors from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
  (Diagnostic) Data Set.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the spline chart?

  2. Would you like to display grid lines on the chart?

  3. Do you need a legend to differentiate between ''texture_mean'' and ''smoothness_mean''?

  4. Should there be a title for the chart, if so, what text should it be?

  5. Do you want axis titles? If so, what should they be?

  6. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for the splines?

  7. Should the chart include markers on individual data points?

  8. Would you like to add a trendline or curve-fitting line to the chart?

  9. Do you want to display data labels for individual data points?

  10. Should there be tooltips or annotations for specific data points?'
