initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing key attributes of the Breast
  Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, specifically focusing on the means of 'radius',
  'texture', 'perimeter', 'area', 'smoothness', and 'concavity'. Annotate the chart
  to highlight and describe significant data points for Malignant (M) and Benign (B)
  diagnoses. This will help in differentiating characteristics of the two diagnoses
  visually. Your charts should have clear labels and be visually intuitive to quickly
  grasp the differences between M and B cases. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for differentiating Malignant (M)
  and Benign (B) diagnoses?

  2. Would you like to include a legend on the radar chart?

  3. Should the radar chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the radar chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the format or placement of annotations?

  7. Are there any additional details you want to be highlighted in the annotations?

  8. Do you prefer the axes of the radar chart to be normalized or use the actual
  data scale?

  9. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the chart elements?
