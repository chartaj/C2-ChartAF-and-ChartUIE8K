initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between all variables
  in the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Use color gradients to indicate
  the strength of correlations, with strong positive correlations in one color and
  strong negative correlations in another. Ensure the heatmap includes all numerical
  variables from the dataset, such as radius_mean, texture_mean, perimeter_mean, and
  area_mean. Label the axes appropriately and include a color bar to indicate correlation
  values. This will help in understanding the relationships between different features
  in diagnosing breast cancer.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. How would you like positive and negative correlations to be represented in terms
  of color gradients?

  3. What range of values should the color bar cover?

  4. Should exact correlation values be displayed within the cells of the heatmap?

  5. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the axis labels?

  6. Would you like any annotations or additional text to be included in the heatmap?

  7. How much emphasis should be placed on grid lines within the heatmap?

  8. Would you like the heatmap to be clustered or not?'
