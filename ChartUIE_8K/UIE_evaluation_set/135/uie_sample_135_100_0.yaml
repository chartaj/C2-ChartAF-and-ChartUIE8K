initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
  Data. Focus on key attributes like 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', and 'perimeter_mean'
  for both malignant (M) and benign (B) diagnoses. Use text annotations to highlight
  median values and relevant statistics. The purpose is to compare the central tendency
  and variability of these attributes between different diagnoses to aid in understanding
  patterns associated with breast cancer. Highlight outliers to bring attention to
  anomalies. This chart will serve healthcare professionals in quickly identifying
  significant features in breast cancer diagnostics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between malignant
  and benign diagnoses?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the box chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the box chart?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the positioning of text annotations?

  5. Should the outliers be highlighted using specific symbols or colors?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the scale or range of the y-axis?

  7. Would you like to display the quartile ranges in a particular style or color?

  8. Do you prefer the median values to be highlighted in a distinct manner?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different elements?

  10. Would you like to include any additional statistical information or notes on
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  3. I prefer vertical orientation.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the positioning of text annotations.
