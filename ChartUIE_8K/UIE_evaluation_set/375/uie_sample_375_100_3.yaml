initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize each person's income
  over time based on a dataset that includes information such as year, sex, name,
  n (number), and prop (proportion). The x-axis should represent the years, and the
  y-axis should represent the income values. Different colors can be used to distinguish
  between males and females. Additionally, it would be useful to include data points
  for the most common names, such as Helen, Amanda, and Betty, to see their income
  distribution over different years. Please ensure the plot is clear and insightful.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for distinguishing
  between males and females?

  2. Should any particular axis ranges or limits be set for the x-axis (years) and
  y-axis (income values)?

  3. Is there a specific marker style or shape you prefer for the data points?

  4. Would you like to include labels for the data points, especially for the names
  Helen, Amanda, and Betty?

  5. Do you want any gridlines or background shading to enhance the readability of
  the chart?

  6. Are there any additional titles or annotations you would like to see on the chart
  (e.g., a subtitle or descriptive text)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  chart title?'
