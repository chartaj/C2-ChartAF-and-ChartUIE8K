initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to compare the income distribution over
  time for different sexes and names from the given dataset. Make sure to plot the
  distribution for each name and sex combination across the years provided. Each box
  should represent the spread of income (column 'n') over the different years. Use
  the 'prop' column to show the proportional representation and ensure all unique
  values are captured. This will help visualize the trends and variations in income
  among individuals over the specified timeline in a business context.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for distinguishing between different
  sexes and names in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  3. Is there a preferred ordering for displaying the names on the chart?

  4. How would you like to represent the proportional representation (''prop'') on
  the chart?

  5. What level of detail would you prefer for the time axis? (e.g., yearly, every
  5 years)

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the boxplot elements, such as whisker
  lengths or outlier markers?

  7. Are there any specific statistical measures you would like to see highlighted
  on the chart (e.g., mean, median)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include titles and labels for the axes.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the ordering of names.

  4. I am not sure how to represent the proportional representation (''prop'') on
  the chart.

  5. I would prefer yearly detail on the time axis.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Highlighting the median would be useful.

  8. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be located.'
