initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of female baby names
  in 1880. Highlight the most popular names using a different color to make them stand
  out. Add text annotations to show the exact number of occurrences and the proportion
  for some key names like Helen, Amanda, and Betty. This will help in understanding
