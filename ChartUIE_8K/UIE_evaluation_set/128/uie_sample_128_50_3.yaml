initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize literacy rates across different countries
  and regions. Highlight regions with the highest and lowest literacy rates. Include
  population density and GDP per capita as additional factors for each country.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the data values to be displayed directly on the heatmap cells?

  3. How many color gradients would you prefer for differentiating literacy rates?

  4. Should we use separate color scales for population density and GDP per capita,
  or one unified scale?

  5. Is there a specific geographical layout or projection you would like for the
  map?

  6. Would you prefer the regions with the highest and lowest literacy rates to be
  highlighted with specific colors or symbols?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend for better understanding of the color intensities?

  8. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be emphasized or annotated?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, highlight regions with the highest and lowest literacy rates with specific
  colors.
