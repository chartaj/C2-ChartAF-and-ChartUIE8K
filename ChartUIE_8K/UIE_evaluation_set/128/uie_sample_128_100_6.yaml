initial_prompt: I would like to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of
  GDP per capita for the countries listed in the dataset "Countries of the World"
  related to social-science. The histogram should display the frequency of countries
  falling within certain GDP per capita ranges. This will help to understand how GDP
  is distributed among different countries in the dataset. Please consider the missing
  values, ensuring they are handled appropriately, and use an appropriate number of
  bins to provide a clear and informative distribution. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins to be used in the histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like the histogram to display any specific labels on the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis show frequencies or relative percentages?

  5. Do you have a preference for how missing values should be handled (e.g., removal
  or imputation) before plotting the histogram?

  6. Would you like to include any particular titles or subtitles for the histogram?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Do you need gridlines on the histogram for better readability?

  9. Should the histogram include a legend, and if so, what should it describe?

  10. Do you have any specific preference for the overall size and aspect ratio of
  the histogram plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please label the x-axis as "GDP per Capita" and the y-axis as "Number of
  Countries."

  4. Frequencies, please.

  5. Please remove missing values before plotting.

  6. Title: "Distribution of GDP per Capita Among Countries." I am not sure about
  the subtitle.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  9. No, a legend is not necessary.

  10. I am not sure.'
