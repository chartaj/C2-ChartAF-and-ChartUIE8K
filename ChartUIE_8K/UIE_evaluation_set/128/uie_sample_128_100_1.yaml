initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the population distribution
  across different regions from the dataset "Countries of the World." Each bar should
  represent a region, with different colored segments for individual countries within
  each region. Include annotations for bars representing the top three countries by
  population to draw attention to these specific data points. Highlight these countries'
  segments to make them stand out visually. The chart will help in understanding the
  population density and distribution among different regions and the contribution
  of leading countries. Keep the design clean and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Do you have specific preferences for the font style and size for annotations?

  3. Is there a preferred order in which the regions should be displayed on the chart?

  4. What level of detail do you want for the annotations of the top three countries?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have a preference for its
  placement?

  6. Do you want gridlines or other reference lines to be included in the chart?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer any specific margin or padding settings for the chart layout?

  9. How would you like the highlighted segments for the top three countries to be
  visually distinguished (e.g., bold outline, different shades)?

  10. Should the axis labels (Region and Population) follow any specific format or
  style?'
