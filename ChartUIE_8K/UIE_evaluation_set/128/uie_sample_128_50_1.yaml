initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the population, area, and GDP
  per capita for each country. Annotate specific countries with high GDP per capita
  to emphasize economic differences. Highlight regions to distinguish geopolitical
  areas. This will facilitate easy comparison of economic and demographic data in
  the context of global regions.

  on the chart?

  7. Would you prefer any specific background or gridline settings for the chart?

  8. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to add to the chart?

  9. How detailed would you like the tooltip information to be (e.g., showing all
