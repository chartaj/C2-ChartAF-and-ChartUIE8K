initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the GDP ($ per capita) of different
  countries. Add text annotations displaying the exact GDP values for each country.
  Highlight countries with the highest and lowest GDP to emphasize the disparity.
  The chart should help understand the economic differences across regions and the
  possible correlation with other variables like literacy or population density. This
  visualization will be useful for comparative analysis in social science studies,
  focusing on economic indicators. Include a legend explaining the highlights and
  any patterns observed in the data.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?\n\
  2. Would you like the countries to be sorted in a specific order, such as ascending\
  \ or descending by GDP?\n3. Do you prefer a specific format or style for the text\
  \ annotations displaying the exact GDP values (e.g., font size, color)?\n4. How\
  \ would you like the highlighted countries with the highest and lowest GDP to be\
  \ emphasized (e.g., different bar color, border, shading)?\n5. Do you have a specific\
  \ preference for the background or grid lines in the chart? \n6. Would you prefer\
  \ the bar chart to be in a vertical or horizontal orientation?\n7. Is there a particular\
  \ way you would like the legend to be formatted or positioned?\n8. Do you have any\
  \ preference for the axis titles and labels (e.g., font style, size)?\n9. Are there\
  \ any additional data layers or reference lines you would like to include in the\
  \ chart to show correlations with literacy or population density?\n10. Do you have\
  \ a preferred size or aspect ratio for the bar chart?"
