initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the impact of COVID-19 across
  different sectors. Use "Branche" as categories and group by "Home-Office", "mit
  Lohn", "ohne Lohn", "Kurzarbeit", "arbeitslos", and "wie bisher". Annotate the highest
  and lowest values for each category to highlight extremes. Ensure the x-axis represents
  different sectors and the y-axis shows the number of people. This will help visualize
  how each sector was affected and which categories had significant changes. Include
  a title and labels for clarity. Highlight notable sectors with distinct colors.
