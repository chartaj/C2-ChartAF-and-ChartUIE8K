initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the bike and pedestrian traffic
  over time at the Broadway Cycle Track North Of E Union St. I want the X-axis to
  represent the date and time, and the Y-axis to show the counts. Use different colored
  lines to distinguish between bike_count and ped_count. This will help in understanding
  the trends and patterns in foot and bike traffic on this track.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bike_count and ped_count
  lines?

  2. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  3. What title would you like for the chart?

  4. Do you have specific preferences for the labels of the X-axis and Y-axis?

  5. Would you like to add any annotations or markers on the chart to highlight specific
  dates or events?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to bike_count
  and ped_count?

  7. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the bike_count
  and ped_count lines?

  8. Would you like to smooth the lines or display every individual data point?

  9. Is there a specific date range you want the chart to focus on?

  10. Are there any specific time intervals (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly) you prefer
  for the X-axis ticks?'
