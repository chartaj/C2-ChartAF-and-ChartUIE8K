initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart using the data from '../Extra_datas/data/420.csv'.
  The x-axis should represent the different 'crossings', and the y-axis should display
  the counts. Each column should be stacked to show 'bike_count' and 'ped_count' for
  each crossing. I want to visualize how bike and pedestrian counts compare at each
  crossing. Filter the data to exclude any missing values for clearer analysis. Also,
  color-code the stacks with distinct colors for 'bike_count' and 'ped_count' to differentiate
  them easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for ''bike_count'' and ''ped_count''?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the columns?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the crossings on the x-axis or should they
  be sorted by data values?

  4. Should the y-axis be set to a specific scale or range?

  5. Would you like grid lines for easier comparison between columns? If yes, should
  they be light or prominent?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between ''bike_count'' and
  ''ped_count''?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific crossings or data points in the chart?

  9. Should the chart have a title or any additional annotations for clarity?

  10. Do you prefer the chart background to be a specific color or keep it neutral?'
