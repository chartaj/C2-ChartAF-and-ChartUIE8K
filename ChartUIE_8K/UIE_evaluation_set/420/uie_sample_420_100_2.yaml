initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize bike and pedestrian counts over
  time at various crossings. Highlight specific data points where bike or pedestrian
  counts are particularly high to draw attention to peak usage times. Use text annotations
  to display exact counts for these highlighted points. Ensure the plot visually distinguishes
  between different crossings and directions to provide clear insights. The visualization
  will help identify patterns in bike and pedestrian traffic and inform decisions
  on infrastructure improvements and safety measures. Use distinct colors and sizes
  for clarity. Include a legend and axis labels for context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for distinguishing
  between different crossings and directions?

  2. Are there particular symbols or markers you prefer for the highlighted data points?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted for the highlighted peak
  usage points?

  4. Is there a preferred size range for the data points on the scatter plot to aid
  in clarity?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or positioning of the legend?

  6. Do you have any preferred fonts or styles for the axis labels and annotations?

  7. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or reference
  lines on the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. The text annotations should display exact counts clearly next to the highlighted
  points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
