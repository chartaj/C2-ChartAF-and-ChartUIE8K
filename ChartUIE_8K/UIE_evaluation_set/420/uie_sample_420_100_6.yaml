initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset detailing bike and pedestrian counts at various
  crossings and times. I’d like a bar chart showing the average bike and pedestrian
  counts per crossing. Each bar should represent a different crossing location with
  two bars per crossing: one for average bike count and one for average pedestrian
  count. Use data from the ‘crossing’, ‘bike_count’, and ‘ped_count’ columns. Ensure
  the chart highlights the significant difference or similarity in counts visually.
  The time and direction aren’t necessary for this visualization. The chart should
  be clear and have labeled axes and a legend.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  bike counts and pedestrian counts?

  2. Would you like the chart to include any specific titles or subtitles?

  3. Do you want the y-axis to have a specific range or scale?

  4. Should the bars be displayed side-by-side or as stacked bars?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular format or placement for the legend that you prefer?

  8. Do you want to include data labels on the bars to show the exact counts?

  9. Are there any specific crossing locations you want to highlight or annotate in
  the chart?'
