initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize bike and pedestrian counts at different
  crossings and times. Highlight specific time slots with highest counts to emphasize
  peak traffic periods. Include text annotations for unique crossings and directions
  to provide context. Use color variations in the heatmap to distinguish between low
  and high counts effectively, thus drawing attention to key traffic patterns. This
  visualization aims to help urban planners and traffic managers identify critical
  periods and locations for optimizing pedestrian and bike infrastructure.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific time range you want to highlight in the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between low and high
  counts effectively?

  3. Would you like to customize the text annotations for unique crossings and directions?
  If so, how?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout or organization of the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include in the chart?

  6. How detailed would you like the time segmentation to be (e.g., hourly, daily,
  weekly)?

  7. Do you prefer a particular ordering or grouping for the crossings and directions
  in the heatmap?

  8. Are there any additional contextual elements you would like to include in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Hourly would be good.

  7. I have no specific preference.
