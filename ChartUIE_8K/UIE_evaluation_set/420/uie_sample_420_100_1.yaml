initial_prompt: Visualize bike and pedestrian counts from the dataset over time using
  a box chart. Annotate key time periods or outliers to highlight significant variations
  or trends. This helps in understanding peak hours or days for bike and pedestrian
  traffic. Summary statistics should also be displayed.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the box plots to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Should the x-axis be segmented by hours, days, weeks, or some other time interval?

  4. How would you prefer the outliers to be annotated? (e.g., arrows, labels)

  5. Do you want grid lines to be shown on the chart for better readability?

  6. What level of detail would you like for the summary statistics? (e.g., mean,
  median, quartiles, etc.)

  7. Do you have any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the axes
  or the chart itself?

  8. Would you like to highlight weekends or specific holidays in the chart?

  9. Are there any particular time periods you are most interested in focusing on?

  10. Do you want a legend or any other additional annotations to be included in the
  chart?'
