initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing the IQ distribution across three different
  countries. I'd like to create a scatter plot to visualize this information. Each
  country should be represented by different colors or markers, and the x-axis should
  show the country names while the y-axis shows the IQ scores. I am interested in
  seeing how IQ varies within each country and across the three nations. This visualization
  should help in understanding the dispersion and central tendencies of IQ in the
  given countries. Please use the provided data for creating this scatter plot.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing the different
  countries?

  2. Do you prefer any particular style or shape for the markers representing the
  countries on the scatter plot?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be included on the scatter plot?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the countries?

  5. Do you want to add any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Is there any particular font style or size preference for the text elements in
  the chart?

  7. Do you want to display central tendency measures such as mean or median on the
  scatter plot?

  8. Is there any specific range you want to set for the y-axis (IQ scores)?

  9. Would you like any specific formatting for the country names on the x-axis?

  10. Do you prefer any specific layout or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I do not know, any simple shape like circles should be fine.

  3. I am not sure, whichever looks best.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between the countries.

  5. Please add labels: "Countries" for the x-axis and "IQ Scores" for the y-axis.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  7. Yes, please show the mean IQ score for each country.

  8. I do not know, I don''t have a specific range in mind for the y-axis.

  9. I do not have any specific formatting preferences for the country names.

  10. I do not know, any standard layout should work.'
