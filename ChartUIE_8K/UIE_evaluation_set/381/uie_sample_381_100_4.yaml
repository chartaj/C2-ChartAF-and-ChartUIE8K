initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the IQ distribution across
  different countries. The data is from a social science context and consists of IQ
  measurements for three countries. Ensure that the histogram clearly shows the frequency
  of each IQ range and differentiate the countries using different colors or patterns.
  Label the x-axis with IQ scores and the y-axis with frequency. Include a legend
  to identify each country and descriptive titles for clarity. Analyzing IQ distribution
  trends will be easier with this detailed visual representation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the different countries
  in the histogram?

  2. Would you prefer the countries to be differentiated by patterns or by colors,
  or both?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins (IQ ranges) in the histogram?

  4. Is there any specific title you would like for the histogram?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the histogram?

  7. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location within the chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., vertical
  vs. horizontal bars)?

  9. Would you like any axis (x or y) to be represented in logarithmic scale, or should
  they be in linear scale?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Both would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. "IQ Distribution Across Countries"

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Vertical bars are preferred.

  9. Linear scale is fine.'
