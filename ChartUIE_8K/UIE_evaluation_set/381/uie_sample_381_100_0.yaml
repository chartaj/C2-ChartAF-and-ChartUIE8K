initial_prompt: '<start of user instruction>

  Create a bar chart showing the IQ distribution across three countries from the dataset.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the countries and the y-axis displays the average IQ.
  Highlight the country with the highest average IQ using a different color. Annotate
  the bar for each country with its corresponding average IQ value to provide a clear
  comparison. This chart aims to visualize the differences in average IQ for social
  science analysis.
