initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart that visualizes the IQ distribution
  across different countries. Use the data from the file '381.csv'. The chart should
  have countries on the x-axis and IQ scores on the y-axis. Each country's column
  should represent the IQ scores of different individuals stacked atop each other.
  Ensure the chart is color-coded for easy differentiation between the stacked segments
  within each country's column. Include appropriate labels and a legend to clarify
  the information. This will help in comparing the cognitive performance amongst the
  three given countries.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different segments\
  \ within each country's column?\n2. What style of labels would you prefer for the\
  \ x-axis and y-axis? \n3. Should the font size and type for the labels have any\
  \ specific requirements?\n4. Do you prefer the legend to be placed in any specific\
  \ location on the chart?\n5. Would you like to include any specific titles for the\
  \ chart and axes?\n6. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, do you have\
  \ a preference for their style or color?\n7. Is there any additional text or annotation\
  \ you would like included on the chart?"
