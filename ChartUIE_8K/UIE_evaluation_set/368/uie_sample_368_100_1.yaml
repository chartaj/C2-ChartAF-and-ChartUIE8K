initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the suicide rates from 1985 to 2016,
  highlighting the variations across different countries and years. Use text annotations
  to display values of outlier points to draw attention to specific extreme cases.
  The highlighted elements should distinguish the 'generation' through color coding
  for better clarity. The practical purpose of this visualization is to offer insights
  into trends and patterns in suicide rates by country and year. The goal is to make
  it easier for researchers to discern impactful variations and potentially correlate
  them with social or economic changes reflected in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or intervals for
  the years displayed on the x-axis?

  2. Are there any specific countries you would like to focus on or exclude?

  3. Which color palette do you prefer for distinguishing ''generations'' in the chart?

  4. Do you have any specific formatting preferences for the text annotations that
  display outlier values?

  5. Would you like to include any additional statistical markers such as mean or
  median indicators within the box plots?

  6. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation (vertical/horizontal) for the
  box chart?

  7. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to include to enhance
  interpretability for researchers?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font type or size used in the chart, especially
  for annotations and labels?'
