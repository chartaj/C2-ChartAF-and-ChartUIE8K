initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the suicide rates from 1985
  to 2016. The chart should display the number of suicides for different age groups
  and genders across various countries. Use 'country' on the x-axis, 'suicides_no'
  on the y-axis, and group by 'sex'. Include another grouping by age categories. Highlight
  the differences in suicide rates between males and females for each age group in
  different countries. Also, use different colors for each generation to emphasize
  generational disparities. Make sure to include a legend and proper labels for clarity.

  2. What level of detail would you like in the axis labels? (e.g., Full country names,
  or abbreviations)

  3. Do you have a specific order in which you want countries to be displayed on the
  x-axis?

  4. Are there any specific age groups you would like to focus on or prioritize in
  the visualization?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to include gridlines for easier reading of values?

  6. How would you like the legend to be positioned? (e.g., Top, bottom, left, right)

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or additional markers for specific data
  points or trends?

  9. Do you want to include error bars or confidence intervals on the bars to represent
  variability?

  10. Are there any particular countries you want to highlight or distinguish from
  the others?'
