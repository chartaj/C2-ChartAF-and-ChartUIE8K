initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing global suicide rates from 1985
  to 2016. The data includes countries, years, sex, age groups, suicide numbers, populations,
  and GDP. Focus on representing "suicides/100k pop" across different countries and
  years. Highlight variations by country and significant trends over time. Use color
  gradients to differentiate suicide rates, ensuring clear visual distinctions between
  low and high rates. Incorporate interactive elements such as tooltips displaying
  detailed info (country, year, rate). Additionally, group data by sex and age to
  show demographic differences. Provide options to filter by year and generation.
