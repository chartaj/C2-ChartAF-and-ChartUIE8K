initial_prompt: Can you create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the top companies
  by workforce size? I'd like to see the number of employees on one axis and the companies
  on the other. Use different colors to represent the various company origins (United
  States, Taiwan, etc.). Include the share price (USD) as another stacked section
  in each bar. Please ensure the chart is labeled clearly and includes a legend for
  easy interpretation. This will help us compare workforce sizes and share prices
  across different company origins more effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you''d like
  to use for the company origins?

  2. How many top companies would you like to display in the chart?

  3. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted in any specific way, such as by workforce
  size or company name?

  4. Are there specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the chart
  besides the legend and axis labels?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to include specific gridlines or background details to enhance
  readability?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the title of the chart?

  8. Should the share price be displayed as absolute values or in a normalized form
  relative to each company?

  9. Would you like any specific axis ranges or limits for the number of employees
  and share price?'
