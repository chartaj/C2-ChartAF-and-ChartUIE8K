initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the share prices of the top 10 companies
  with the largest workforces. Use the data from the 'Global Organizations Ranked
  by Workforce Size' dataset. The x-axis should represent the companies, and the y-axis
  should represent the share prices (USD). Highlight any missing values in the 'Company
  origin' column to better understand the geographical distribution of these companies.
  Make sure the heatmap clearly differentiates between different share price ranges.
  This visualization should help identify trends in share prices relative to workforce
  size and company origin.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating share price
  ranges?

  2. How would you like the missing values in the ''Company origin'' column to be
  highlighted?

  3. Is there a specific order you prefer for the companies on the x-axis, such as
  alphabetical or based on workforce size?

  4. Do you want to include labels or annotations on the heatmap to indicate specific
  share prices or company origins?

  5. Would you prefer any specific styles or themes for the heatmap to align with
  your business presentation or report format?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a preferred color scheme. Maybe something that clearly
  contrasts between different ranges.

  2. I do not know how the missing values should be highlighted. Maybe you can suggest
  something?

  3. I prefer the companies to be ordered based on workforce size.

  4. I would like to include labels indicating specific share prices.

  5. I have no specific preference for styles or themes.'
