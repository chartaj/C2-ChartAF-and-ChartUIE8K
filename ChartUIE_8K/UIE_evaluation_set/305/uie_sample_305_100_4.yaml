initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the top three global organizations
  ranked by workforce size based on the provided data. The chart should have the x-axis
  representing the company names and the y-axis representing the number of employees.
  Ensure that the company names ("Walmart," "Amazon," and "Foxconn") and their corresponding
  employee numbers are clearly labeled. Additionally, differentiate the bars using
  distinct colors to make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret. This
  will help us understand the distribution of employees among the largest companies
  globally.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  the bars to be?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be labeled with the exact number of employees on
  top?

  3. Should the chart have a title? If so, what would you like the title to be?

  4. Do you want any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability, or should they
  be minimized?

  6. Should there be any additional annotations or explanatory text on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included, even if the chart is relatively simple
  in terms of colors and categories?'
