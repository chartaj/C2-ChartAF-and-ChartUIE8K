initial_prompt: '<start of user instruction>

  I''d like a line chart showing the relationship between the ERP (Effective Radiated
  Power) and HAAT (Height Above Average Terrain) for the Digital TV Station Transmitter
  Data. Plot ERP on the y-axis and HAAT on the x-axis. Additionally, include markers
  for different CALLSIGN values, so we can easily distinguish each transmitter station.
  Please ensure the chart is easy to read and clearly labeled, as this will help in
  analyzing the transmission power against the antenna height for various stations
  across the dataset.

  <end of user instruction>'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the markers representing
  different CALLSIGN values?

  2. Would you prefer the markers to be different shapes for each CALLSIGN, or is
  color differentiation sufficient?

  3. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  4. Are there specific axis ranges you would like to set for the x-axis (HAAT) or
  y-axis (ERP)?

  5. Do you want a legend included, and if so, should it be placed inside or outside
  the chart area?

  6. Do you have specific titles or labels in mind for the chart, x-axis, and y-axis?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, would you
  prefer them on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  8. Are there any annotations or specific data points you would like to highlight
  on the chart?

  9. Do you require any text formatting preferences for the labels and titles (e.g.,
  font size, bold, italics)?

  10. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I think color differentiation should be sufficient.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have any specific ranges in mind.

  5. Yes, please include a legend, and it should be placed inside the chart area.

  6. The title can be "ERP vs HAAT for Digital TV Station Transmitter Data". The x-axis
  label should be "HAAT (Height Above Average Terrain)", and the y-axis label should
  be "ERP (Effective Radiated Power)".

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for both the x-axis and y-axis for better readability.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have any specific preferences for text formatting.

  10. I do not have a specific size or aspect ratio in mind.'
