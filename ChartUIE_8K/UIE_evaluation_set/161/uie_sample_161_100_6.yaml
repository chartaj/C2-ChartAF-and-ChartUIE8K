initial_prompt: I'd like to create a scatter plot using the digital TV station transmitter
  data from the dataset. Please plot the data points with 'X' on the x-axis and 'Y'
  on the y-axis, representing the geographical coordinates of the stations. Differentiate
  the data points by 'CHANNEL' using different colors or markers. Label the axes appropriately,
  and include a legend that clearly indicates which color or marker corresponds to
  each channel. Make sure the plot is clear and easy to understand, highlighting the
  distribution and clustering of stations. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for differentiating
  the channels?

  2. Would you prefer specific marker types for different channels, or should all
  markers be the same shape with different colors?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  plot besides the axis labels and legend?

  4. Is there a preferred style or format for the grid lines on the plot, or should
  they be omitted?

  5. Would you prefer the plot to have a title? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  6. Should the plot have axis ticks and if yes, do you have a preference for the
  frequency of these ticks on both axes?'
