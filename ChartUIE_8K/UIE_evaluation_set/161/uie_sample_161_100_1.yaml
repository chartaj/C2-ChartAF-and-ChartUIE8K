initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map of the US, highlighting states based on the
  density of licensed digital TV station transmitters from the provided dataset. Use
  different color gradients to represent varying transmitter densities. Annotate key
  states, such as Alaska, with specific data on transmitter counts and main licensees
  to draw attention. The map should help identify regions with high concentrations
  of transmitters, facilitating a better understanding of digital TV coverage across
  the country for media and communications analysis. Please ensure the annotations
  provide clear insights into the highlighted areas.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradient representing
  transmitter densities?

  2. What level of detail would you like for the annotations on key states?

  3. Should the annotations include exact transmitter counts and main licensees, or
  would a summary suffice?

  4. How would you like the color gradients to be scaled (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  5. Are there any specific states, besides Alaska, that you want to be highlighted
  or annotated?

  6. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers)?

  7. Would you like labels for all states or just the key ones?

  8. Should the map include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  9. Do you have any specific font or style preferences for the annotations and labels
  on the map?

  10. Are there any additional data elements or overlays you would like to see on
  the map (e.g., major cities, geographical features)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I would like a moderate level of detail for the annotations.

  3. Exact transmitter counts and main licensees would be preferred.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Just the key ones.

  8. Yes, please include a legend.

  9. I do not have any specific font or style preferences.
