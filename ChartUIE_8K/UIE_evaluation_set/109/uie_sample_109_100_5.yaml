initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of coffee
  brewing methods across different age groups. Use the "age" and "brew" columns from
  the dataset. Each bar should represent an age group, and the segments within each
  bar should show the proportion of respondents using different brewing methods like
  drip, pod/capsule machine, or bean-to-cup. Label the brewing methods and age groups
  clearly for easy comparison. This will help in understanding the popular brewing
  methods among different age demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different segments representing
  brewing methods?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be ordered on the x-axis (e.g., ascending,
  descending, custom order)?

  3. Would you prefer to see the segment values displayed as absolute numbers, percentages,
  or both?

  4. Is there a specific format you want for the axis labels and ticks (e.g., font
  size, font type, angle)?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title and legend placement?

  6. Should the chart include any specific annotations or callouts for certain age
  groups or brewing methods?

  7. Would you like gridlines or background shading to improve readability, and if
  so, how should they look?

  8. Are there any specific margin or padding preferences for the chart to fit within
  a particular layout or page?

  9. Is there any specific labeling or tooltip information you want displayed when
  hovering over the segments of the bar chart?'
