initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the Great American Coffee Taste Test Dataset
  to visualize the relationship between age groups and their coffee preference (favorite).
  Annotate data points to highlight unique observations, like age groups with distinct
  coffee types. Use highlights to emphasize the most common coffee preferences across
  different demographics. The scatter plot should help understand trends in coffee
  drinking habits based on age. Include legends and labels for clarity. This will
  help focus on understanding how different age groups prefer various types of coffee.
  Show missing values distinctly.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer a particular style for the annotations on the data points?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of labels and legends?

  5. Should the axis labels have specific titles or formats?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the scatter plot?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the shape and size of the data points?

  8. Is there a particular way youâ€™d like the highlights for common coffee preferences
  to be shown?

  9. Should the legend include specific details beyond basic color and shape information?

  10. How detailed should the annotations for unique observations be?
