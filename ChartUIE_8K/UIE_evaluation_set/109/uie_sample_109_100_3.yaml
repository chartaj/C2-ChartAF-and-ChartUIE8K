initial_prompt: I would like to create a line chart to visualize the preference trends
  for different coffee types (regular drip coffee, iced coffee, etc.) across various
  age groups in The Great American Coffee Taste Test Dataset. The x-axis should represent
  the age categories (e.g., 18-24, 25-34), and the y-axis should indicate the number
  of individuals who prefer each coffee type within those age groups. Each coffee
  type should have its own line for easy comparison. This will help understand how
  coffee preferences change with age. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to read.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred theme or color palette for the chart?

  2. Would you like to emphasize any specific age groups or coffee types?

  3. Do you want gridlines for better readability, and if so, in what style?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on the chart lines or only in a legend?

  6. How would you prefer the legend to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, side)?

  7. Do you have specific line styles or markers in mind for differentiating coffee
  types?

  8. Would you like any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key insights?'
