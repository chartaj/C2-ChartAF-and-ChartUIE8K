initial_prompt: I need a bar chart displaying the preferences for different brewing
  methods among different age groups from "The Great American Coffee Taste Test Dataset."
  For each age group, show the count of respondents who prefer each brewing method
  (e.g., pod/capsule machine, bean-to-cup machine, regular drip coffee, etc.). The
  x-axis should represent age groups, and the y-axis should show the count of preferred
  brewing methods. Use different colors for each brewing method for clear differentiation.
  This visualization will help understand brewing preferences specific to age demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for each brewing method?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be grouped or stacked for each age group?

  3. Is there a particular order you would like the age groups to be displayed on
  the x-axis?

  4. Do you want to include specific labels or annotations on the bars?

  5. What style or theme would you like for the overall chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  bold, professional)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned?

  7. Are there any particular fonts you prefer for the labels and titles?

  8. Do you need grid lines on the chart? If yes, horizontal, vertical, or both?

  9. Would you like any specific title, subtitles, or descriptive text included on
  the chart?'
