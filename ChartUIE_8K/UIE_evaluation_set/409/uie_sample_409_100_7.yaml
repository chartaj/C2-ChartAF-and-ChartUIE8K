initial_prompt: Please create a hexagonal binning plot illustrating the mineral reserves
  estimates. The x-axis should represent the 'x' values (quantitative measure), while
  the y-axis should represent the 'y' values (another quantitative measure). Each
  hexagon should reflect the data density, helping to understand the concentration
  of reserve estimates. Additionally, use color coding to differentiate the 'group'
  categories (‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’). Ensure the chart is labeled correctly, providing a clear
  title and axis labels, and include a legend to indicate which colors correspond
  to which groups. Make it visually appealing for presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the group categories?

  2. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the title and axis labels?

  3. Do you have a preferred bin size for the hexagons in the plot?

  4. Would you like any grid lines on the plot for better readability? If so, in what
  style?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the plot?

  6. Do you prefer any specific formatting for the legend (e.g., position, font size,
  or shape of legend markers)?

  7. Should the axis ranges be automatically adjusted based on the data, or do you
  have specific ranges in mind?

  8. Do you wish to include any annotations or additional labels on specific data
  points?'
