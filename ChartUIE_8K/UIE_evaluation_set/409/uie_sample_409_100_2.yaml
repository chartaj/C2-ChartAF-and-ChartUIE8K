initial_prompt: Create a beeswarm chart to visualize mineral reserves estimates in
  the energy sector using this data. Include groups A, B, and C, comparing their respective
  reserves ('x' and 'y'). Add text annotations to highlight key data points that mark
  anomalies or trends, focusing on outliers. Utilize shape annotations like circles
  or rectangles to encapsulate regions of interest around clustered data points to
  indicate significant data groupings or notable divergences. Ensure the chart effectively
  emphasizes differences between the groups and makes it easier to visualize unique
  and critical aspects of the reserves estimates.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different groups
  (A, B, C) in the beeswarm chart?

  2. What specific markers or symbols would you like to use for text annotations highlighting
  key data points?

  3. Which shapes (circles, rectangles, etc.) do you prefer for encapsulating regions
  of interest around clustered data points?

  4. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Do you have any preferences for the
  font style or size?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart? If so, do you have preferences
  for their style or color?

  6. Are there any specific data points or ranges you already know are key anomalies
  or trends that need extra emphasis?

  7. Do you prefer a minimalist design or a more detailed and colorful chart?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to indicate what each color or shape represents?

  9. Are there any specific guidelines or styles you want the chart to adhere to (e.g.,
  company branding, presentation themes)?'
