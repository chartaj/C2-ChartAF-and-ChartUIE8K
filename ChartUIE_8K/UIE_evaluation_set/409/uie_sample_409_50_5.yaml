initial_prompt: Please create a density plot for visualizing the distribution of variables
  'x' and 'y' across different groups ('A', 'B', and 'C') in the mineral reserves
  estimate dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for distinguishing
  different groups?

  2. Would you like the plot to include a legend to label each group?

  3. Do you want the density plot to show individual data points (e.g., with a scatterplot
  overlay)?

  4. Do you prefer the density to be shown with fill, contour lines, or both?

  5. Should the axes be labeled with specific titles, or should default column names
  be used?

  6. Do you desire grid lines on the plot for better readability, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  7. Are there any specific range limits you want to set for the x and y axes?

  8. Would you like to incorporate any statistical annotations, such as mean or median
  lines, within the plot?

  9. Do you prefer the plot to be in a specific aspect ratio or size to better fit
  certain presentation formats?'
