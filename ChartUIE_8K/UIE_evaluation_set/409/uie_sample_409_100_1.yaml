initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the mineral reserves estimate data. The
  data includes columns for 'x', 'y', and 'group' with no missing values. The purpose
  is to illustrate energy distribution and density at various x and y coordinates,
  categorized by group. Emphasize specific high-value areas with text annotations
  for clarity. Use shape annotations such as arrows or rectangles to compare significant
  areas, and add trend lines if applicable. This will help to focus attention on key
  points before considering the entire dataset, providing valuable context for energy
  resource analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a color preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like high-value areas to be annotated? Do you have a specific format
  or style in mind for the text annotations?

  3. What styles or shapes do you prefer for the comparison annotations, such as arrows
  or rectangles?

  4. Would you like trend lines to be styled in a specific way (e.g., color, thickness,
  dashed or solid)?

  5. Do you prefer specific labeling for the x and y axes?

  6. Are there particular legend configurations or placements you prefer?

  7. Should there be any specific grid lines or background settings on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer to use rectangles for the comparison annotations.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.'
