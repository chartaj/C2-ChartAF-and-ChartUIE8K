initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot showing the relationship between Cumulative
  GPA (CUML_GPA) and Expected GPA (EXP_GPA) for students in higher education. On the
  x-axis, we should have CUML_GPA and on the y-axis, EXP_GPA. Additionally, the points
  should be color-coded based on the 'SCHOLARSHIP' status to observe if there's any
  correlation between these variables. Please make sure the chart is clear and the
  axes are labeled properly. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the points based on the ''SCHOLARSHIP''
  status?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color-coding of ''SCHOLARSHIP''
  status?

  4. Should the chart include a title? If so, what should it be?

  5. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like to add data labels to the points on the scatter plot?

  7. Are there any specific markers you prefer for the points on the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have a specific range in mind for the axes?

  9. Would you like to add trend lines to the scatter plot to highlight the correlation?

  10. Should the chart include any annotations or notes to provide additional context?'
