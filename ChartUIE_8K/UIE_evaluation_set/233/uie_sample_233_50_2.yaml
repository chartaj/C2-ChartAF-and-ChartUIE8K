initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize distributions of GPA (CUML_GPA and
  EXP_GPA) among students. Use text annotations for GPA values and apply highlights
  to distinguish between them. This will help evaluate the performance and study patterns
  in higher education.

  4. Is there a specific range or interval for GPA values that you would like to highlight?

  5. Do you want any specific labels or legends included in the chart to clarify the

  6. Would you prefer the text annotations to include the exact GPA values or summary
  statistics (e.g., mean, median)?

  displayed on the histogram?

  8. Do you have a specific title or subtitle you would like to be included in the
