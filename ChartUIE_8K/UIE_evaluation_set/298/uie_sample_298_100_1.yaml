initial_prompt: 'Create a stacked area chart visualizing CO2-e emissions by transport
  sector from 1990 to 2016. Highlight key sectors like Domestic aviation, Cars, and
  Light commercial vehicles. Annotate significant data points and trends, e.g., spikes
  or declines. Purpose: To track and compare the emission trends of different transport
  sectors over time, and identify the major contributors to CO2-e emissions. This
  visualization will aid in understanding the environmental impact of each sector
  and help prioritize emission reduction strategies.'
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different sectors in the
  stacked area chart?

  2. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should it be placed?

  3. Are there specific significant data points or trends you want annotated?

  4. What style of annotation would you prefer (e.g., arrows, labels, markers)?

  5. Do you prefer a particular font style and size for the chart labels and annotations?

  8. Is there a preferred placement or format for the chart title?

  9. Do you want any additional data or context included, such as average values or
  data summaries?

  10. Should the chart display cumulative emission values or highlight year-over-year
  changes?

  11. Are there any specific patterns or trends you want to ensure are clearly visible?

  12. Would you like to include any supplementary information or explanations within
  the chart for context?

  13. Do you have preferred line styles for different data series, such as dashed
  or solid lines for highlighting certain sectors?

  14. Is there a specific format for the time axis you prefer (e.g., every year labeled,

  15. Would you like to include any footnotes or disclaimers at the bottom of the
  chart?'
