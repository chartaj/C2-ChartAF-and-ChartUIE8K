initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize Jumia's stock price variations over
  time based on the given data. Use the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' prices on
  the y-axis. Highlight significant price changes and annotate key dates where the
  stock prices peaked or dropped significantly. Include color gradients to show the
  intensity of price changes. The practical purpose is to easily identify trends and
  volatility in Jumia's stock prices, helping investors and analysts make informed
  decisions. Use highlights to distinguish important data points, drawing viewers'
  attention to crucial market movements.

  \ or should they be minimized for a cleaner look?\n9. Do you have any preferences\
  \ regarding font style and size for the labels and annotations?\n10. Are there any\
