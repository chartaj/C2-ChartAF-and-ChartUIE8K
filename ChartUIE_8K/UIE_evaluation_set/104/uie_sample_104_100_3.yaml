initial_prompt: I want to create an area chart that visualizes the historical stock
  prices for Jumia. The x-axis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should represent
  the close prices over time. Use different colors to fill the areas between the date
  and close prices. This will help in analyzing the trends and fluctuations in the
  stock's performance over the specified period. Make sure it clearly shows the increasing
  and decreasing trends visually. Additionally, highlight any significant volume spikes
  by plotting the volume data onto the same chart or a secondary y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different areas representing
  the stock prices?

  2. How would you like the volume spikes to be highlighted (e.g., specific colors,
  markers, dashed lines)?

  3. Would you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for the trend
  lines?

  4. Is there a particular font or style you would like for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Do you need grid lines on the chart, and if so, should they be styled in a specific
  way?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for significant dates or
  events on the chart?

  7. Should the secondary y-axis for volume be on the left or right side of the chart?

  8. Do you have a specific date range to focus on, or should the entire dataset be
  used?'
