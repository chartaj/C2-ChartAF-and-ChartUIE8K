initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart visualizing higher education institutions
  in the USA from the dataset. Use the "region" as the x-axis and "id" as the y-axis,
  and represent unique values in the "category" with different colors. For the size
  of the bubbles, use the unique values in the "name" column. Ensure all the regions
  and categories are easily distinguishable and labeled properly. The chart should
  offer a clear comparison of institutions by category and name distribution across
  different regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing the categories?

  2. How would you like the bubbles to be scaledâ€”linearly or logarithmically?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels?

  4. Should the labels for the regions and categories be placed inside or outside
  the bubbles for better readability?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be present on the chart background? If yes, what style
  do you prefer (dotted, solid, etc.)?

  6. Are there any specific regions or categories you want to highlight or differentiate
  more prominently?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart background color or theme (e.g.,
  light, dark)?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  9. Do you want to include a legend to explain the colors and bubble sizes? If yes,
  where would you prefer the legend to be placed?

  10. Are there any annotations or additional information you would like to display
  on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for representing the categories.

  2. I am not sure about the scaling, maybe linear is fine.

  3. I have no specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  4. I am not sure, you can decide what is more readable.

  5. I do not know much about grid lines, so any style is fine.

  6. I do not have any specific regions or categories to highlight.

  7. I have no preference for the overall chart background color or theme.

  8. Please include the title "Comparison of Higher Education Institutions by Region
  and Category".
