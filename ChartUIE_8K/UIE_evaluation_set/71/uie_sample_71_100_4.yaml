initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization of higher education institutions
  in the USA using the provided data. Organize the treemap by region, showing the
  count of institutions in each region. Use colors to differentiate between public
  and private categories. Include institution names when hovered over. This will help
  to visually comprehend the distribution and categorize institutions across different
  regions, with a clear distinction between public and private establishments. The
  treemap should make it easy to identify regions with the highest and lowest number
  of institutions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  public and private institutions?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the institution names when hovered
  over?

  3. Do you have a preferred region order or specific regions you want to highlight?

  4. Are there any particular themes or styles you would prefer for the overall appearance
  of the treemap?

  5. Would you like to include any additional metadata (e.g., URLs) when hovering
  over an institution, besides the institution names?'
