initial_prompt: I'd like to create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of
  higher education institutions by the region in the USA from the provided dataset.
  Specifically, I want to see the density and spread of these institutions across
  different regions to understand regional variations better. Please ensure the plot
  segments by the 'region' column and illustrates the frequency of institutions present
  in each area. This visual will help us identify which regions have higher or lower
  concentrations of educational institutions and further analyze the regional education
  landscape.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different regions on the violin
  plot?

  2. Would you like to display any specific statistical annotations (e.g., mean, median)
  on the plot?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the violin plot (vertical or
  horizontal)?

  4. Is there a specific style or theme you prefer for the plot (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed)?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the plot?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the plot labels and titles?

  7. Should the plot include a legend to identify the regions?

  8. Would you like to have any supplementary information (e.g., count of institutions)
  displayed on the plot?

  9. Is there a particular title or subtitle you would prefer for the violin plot?

  10. Should the axes labels have specific names or units?'
