initial_prompt: Create a tile map to visualize higher education institutions across
  different regions in the USA. Highlight regions with more institutions using distinct
  colors or shades. Annotate specific universities with their names and URLs to focus
  attention on noteworthy examples. Ensure private institutions are distinguishable
  from other types by using different markers. This visualization will provide an
  overview of the geographic distribution of universities, valuable for prospective
  students exploring options or policymakers evaluating regional education infrastructure.
  Include text annotations to highlight key institutions and regions with the highest
  density of universities.

  with more institutions?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or design of the tile map (e.g., size,

  6. Should any specific regions be centered or emphasized in the visualization?

  7. Do you have any preference for the style of text annotations for key institutions
  and high-density regions (e.g., bold, italic)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or key to explain the different colors, shades,
  and markers used in the map?

  9. Are there any additional data points or details you would like to include in
  the visualization?'
