initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize Gene.symbol differences
  in Taxol Drug Resistance cell lines in breast cancer based on logFC and P.Value
  data. Label axes accordingly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different cell lines?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors or patterns used?

  3. Do you want the gene symbols to be labeled on the bars directly or on the x-axis?

  4. Are there particular ranges or thresholds for logFC or P.Value that you want
  highlighted?

  5. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  6. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., scientific notation for P.Value)?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Do you have a preference for the order of cell lines or gene symbols on the x-axis?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  10. How large do you want the font size for labels and titles to be?'
