initial_prompt: I need a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of unique values
  in the 'Reply Count' column from the user comments about the 'Shape of You' song.
  This chart should show the relative proportions of comments with different reply
  counts, providing a clear view of interaction levels within the community. Use varied
  colors to differentiate each segment, and include labels for each reply count category.
  Ensure the pie chart is easy to read, with a legend that helps identify each segment
  accurately. This will help understand how actively users are engaging with each
  other through replies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart segments?

  2. Do you want the labels for each reply count category displayed inside or outside
  the pie chart segments?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like any specific order for the segments, such as descending order
  of reply counts?

  5. Should the pie chart include percentage values in addition to the reply count
  labels?

  6. Are there any particular formatting preferences for the legend (e.g., position,
  orientation)?

  7. Do you have a specific title in mind for the pie chart?'
