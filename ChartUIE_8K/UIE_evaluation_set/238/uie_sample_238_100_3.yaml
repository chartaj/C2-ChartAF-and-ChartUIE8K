initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ''Likes'' and
  ''Reply Count'' from the dataset about the YouTube comments on the "Shape of You"
  song. The histogram should have two separate subplots: one for ''Likes'' and one
  for ''Reply Count''. The x-axis should represent the number of likes or replies,
  and the y-axis should indicate the frequency of those values. Make sure to label
  each axis appropriately and give each subplot a title reflecting whether it represents
  the ''Likes'' or ''Reply Count''.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the bin size or number of bins for the
  histograms?

  2. Would you like any specific color schemes or color preferences for the histograms?

  3. Should there be a grid in the background for better readability?

  4. Do you want the histograms to include any additional statistical information
  like mean or median lines?

  5. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the subplots?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to see the histograms normalized?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to include on the
  charts?

  9. Do you want a legend included, and if so, how should it be formatted?'
