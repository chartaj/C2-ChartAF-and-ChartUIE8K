initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the renewable energy data from 1960 to 2023
  with a geographic heatmap. The data includes information from various locations
  represented by country codes and shows the yearly value of renewable energy in kilotonnes
  of oil equivalent (KTOE). Please create a heatmap that highlights the intensity
  of renewable energy production across different countries and over the years. Make
  sure to account for missing values appropriately. Use a gradient color scheme to
  represent different levels of renewable energy production, with darker colors indicating
  higher production. This will help me understand global renewable energy trends over
  time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the gradient in the heatmap?

  2. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to emphasize in the
  visualization?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be handled in the heatmap?

  4. Do you have preferences regarding the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  Equirectangular)?

  5. Should the heatmap include any annotations or labels for better clarity?

  6. Would you like to include any country borders or geographic features in the background?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for any text or labels on the heatmap?

  8. Should the heatmap display a legend explaining the gradient color scheme?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the time scale display (e.g., every decade,
  every year)?

  10. Would you like to add any additional data layers or contextual information to
  the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Please interpolate missing values, if possible.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include annotations or labels for better clarity.

  6. Yes, include country borders.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, include a legend explaining the gradient color scheme.

  9. Please show the data for every decade.

  10. No, I do not want any additional data layers.'
