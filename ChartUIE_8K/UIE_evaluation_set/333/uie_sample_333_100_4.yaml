initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trend of renewable energy
  consumption in kilotons of oil equivalent (KTOE) for Australia from 1960 to 2015.
  The x-axis should represent the years (TIME), and the y-axis should show the energy
  consumption values (Value). Ensure the chart highlights any significant changes
  and overall trends in renewable energy usage. Include a legend and title the chart
  appropriately. Also, handle any missing data by using linear interpolation to make
  the trend clear. The data ranges from 1960 to 2023, but focus only until 2015 for
  clarity. Thank you!
