initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the renewable energy data
  from 1960 to 2023. The x-axis should represent the year (TIME), and the y-axis should
  represent the energy value (Value). Highlight the years with the highest and lowest
  energy values to draw focus. Add text annotations for these particular points to
  provide context about their significance in the trend. Change the colors of these
  points to make them stand out. Use the given annotations format to enhance clarity
