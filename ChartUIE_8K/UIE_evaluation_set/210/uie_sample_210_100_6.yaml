initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the most subscribed YouTube
  channels data. Use "subscribers" on the x-axis and "video views" on the y-axis.
  Label the points with the "Youtuber" names. Ensure that the data points are easily
  distinguishable and that the chart clearly shows trends between the number of subscribers
  and video views. Since "category" might provide additional insights, use different
  colors or shapes to represent different categories. Make sure to handle any missing
  or zero values appropriately to ensure the chart is as informative as possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors or shapes to represent
  different categories?

  size, font style)?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability of data points?

  4. Do you prefer any specific type of trendline to be added to the chart to visualize
  the correlation?

  prefer?

  chart?

  or emphasize in the visualization?'
