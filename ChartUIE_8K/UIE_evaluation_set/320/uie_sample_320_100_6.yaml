initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to analyze different metrics, including nbits,
  nprimes, msgsize, spawnTime, encrTime, decrTime, and memory for a variant of N Primes
  Based RSA in cryptocurrency and blockchain. Please represent the varying scales
  of each metric accurately to showcase their relationships and impacts. For each
  data point, use different bubble sizes to indicate msgsize and distinct colors for
  varying nbits. Ensure the chart is clear and well-labeled for comprehension.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different ''nbits''
  values?

  2. Would you like specific axis scales or ranges for the x and y axes?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the bubble opacity or borders?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for labels and titles?

  5. Do you need a legend or any additional text annotations on the chart?

  6. Do you want gridlines or background shading to aid in metric comparison?

  7. Should the chart display data point values directly on the visualization?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall chart dimensions or aspect ratio?

  9. Is there a specific format you would like for the titles and axis labels?'
