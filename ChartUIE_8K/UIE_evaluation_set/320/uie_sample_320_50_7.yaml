initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships between the columns:
  nbits, nprimes, msgsize, spawnTime, encrTime, decrTime, and memory in the context
  of N Primes Based RSA Variant Analysis.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include labels for each cell value in the heatmap?

  3. Would you prefer a specific scale or range for the colors used in the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the axis labels (e.g., font
  size, rotation)?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines in the heatmap for better readability?

  7. Should the heatmap display hierarchical clustering or simply the correlation
  values?

  8. Is there a particular order in which you want the columns and rows to be arranged?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you want to include
  on the heatmap?'
