initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot illustrating RSA variant analysis for
  cryptocurrency and blockchain. Plot 'nbits' on the x-axis and 'spawnTime', 'encrTime',
  'decrTime', and 'memory' on the y-axis, using different colors for each metric.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to represent the
  different metrics on the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the scatter plot to include a legend for easy identification of
  each metric?

  3. Do you prefer a specific marker style for the data points for each different
  metric?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units displayed?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you want any specific axis scaling, such as logarithmic or linear, for better
  data representation?

  7. Are there any specific annotation requirements, such as marking certain key data
  points or including data labels?

  8. Do you need the chart to include a title or subtitle for context?

  9. Should there be any specific ranges or limits set on the axes?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the overall size or aspect ratio of the
  scatter plot?'
