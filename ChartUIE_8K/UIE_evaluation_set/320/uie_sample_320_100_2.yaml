initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the RSA variant analysis
  data. The chart should compare 'spawnTime', 'encrTime', and 'decrTime' for different
  'nbits' and 'nprimes' configurations. Annotate key data points to highlight significant
  differences in timing values. Utilize highlights to emphasize variations in 'memory'
  usage across the configurations. The purpose of this visualization is to easily
  compare performance metrics in the cryptocurrency-and-blockchain context. Keep the
  visual clear and focused on helping us discern patterns and outliers in cryptographic
  computations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped side by side for each ''nbits'' and ''nprimes''
  combination, or stacked on top of each other?

  3. Do you prefer any particular style or font for the annotations of key data points?

  4. How would you like the chart to handle the display of memory usage variations?
  (e.g., using different bar colors, distinct patterns, or additional markers)

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different colors or patterns
  used for ''memory'' usage variations?

  6. What level of detail do you want in the axis labels and titles? (e.g., simple
  labels or more descriptive titles)

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines for easier comparison across bars?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines or benchmarks in the chart to aid
  in comparison?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Grouped side by side for each ''nbits'' and ''nprimes'' combination.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Using different bar colors for ''memory'' usage variations.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the different colors.

  6. Simple labels are fine.

  7. Yes, I''d like the chart to have gridlines for easier comparison.

  8. I am not sure.'
