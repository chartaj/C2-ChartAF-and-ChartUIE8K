initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for the given RSA data, plotting 'nbits',
  'nprimes', and 'msgsize' on the x-axis and 'spawnTime', 'encrTime', 'decrTime',
  and 'memory' on the y-axis to analyze performance.
questions: '1. What colors would you prefer for different lines representing ''spawnTime'',
  ''encrTime'', ''decrTime'', and ''memory''?

  2. Do you have a specific line style preference (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for
  different lines?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a legend to be included, and if so, where would you like it to
  be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis have labels, and if so, do you have specific wording
  for those labels?

  6. Would you like to include data markers for each data point on the lines?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scale of the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Should the chart include axis tick marks at specific intervals?

  10. Would you like to include annotations or callouts for specific data points or
  trends in the data?

  11. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines.

  4. Yes, please include a legend, positioned at the bottom.

  5. Yes, label the x-axis as "Input Parameters" and the y-axis as "Performance Metrics".

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the title should be "RSA Performance Analysis".

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.

  11. I have no specific preference.'
