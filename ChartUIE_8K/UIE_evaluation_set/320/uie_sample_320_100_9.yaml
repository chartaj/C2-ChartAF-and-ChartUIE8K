initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'nbits',
  'nprimes', and 'msgsize' from the given data of N Primes Based RSA Variant Analysis
  under the cryptocurrency-and-blockchain context. The histogram should help us understand
  the frequency and patterns of these integer values across the dataset. Make sure
  each of these variables is represented in a separate histogram subplot, so we can
  compare their distributions directly. Include appropriate labels for each axis and
  a legend if necessary for clarity. Use distinct colors for each histogram to differentiate
  them easily. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. Would you like a specific layout for the subplots (e.g., all in one row, one
  column, or a grid layout)?

  3. Is there a specific range or bin size you prefer for the histograms?

  4. Do you want the histograms to have the same x-axis scale for better comparison?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the plots?

  7. Do you prefer any specific style for the histograms (e.g., bars with outlines,
  filled bars, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a specific color scheme.

  2. I do not know; a grid layout could work, but I have no specific preference.

  3. I do not know about the range or bin size; you can choose what seems appropriate.

  4. Yes, having the same x-axis scale would be helpful for better comparison.

  5. I am not sure about font preferences.

  6. I have no specific preference for the legend placement.

  7. I do not have a specific style preference for the histograms.'
