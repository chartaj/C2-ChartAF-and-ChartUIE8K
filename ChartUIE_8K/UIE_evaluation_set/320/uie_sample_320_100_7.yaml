initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to analyze the relationship between the number of
  prime numbers (nprimes) and the RSA variant's encryption time (encrTime) and decryption
  time (decrTime). Use the data points provided in the CSV file stored at ../Extra_datas/data/320.csv
  for the analysis. Please ensure the heatmap is color-coded to clearly indicate different
  time values to help visualize how increasing 'nprimes' affects 'encrTime' and 'decrTime'.
  Include labels for both axes and a legend for the color gradient. This is for an
  RSA variant analysis in a cryptocurrency and blockchain context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific axis label formats or titles you would like?

  3. Should the heatmap include specific gridlines or axis ticks?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of values on the color scale?

  5. Would you prefer a logarithmic or linear scale for the time values?

  6. How detailed should the legend for the color gradient be?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the labels and
  legend?'
