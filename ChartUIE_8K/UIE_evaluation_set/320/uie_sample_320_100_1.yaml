initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the variation in "spawnTime", "encrTime",
  and "decrTime" across different "nbits" and "nprimes" values for the N Primes Based
  RSA Variant Analysis study in the cryptocurrency-and-blockchain domain. Ensure to
  highlight key data points where "msgsize" varies significantly. Include text annotations
  to emphasize critical values and provide context regarding the performance metrics
  (time and memory usage). Use color distinctions effectively to differentiate between
  metrics. This chart will help analyze the efficiency and impact of different configurations
  on RSA variant performance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  "spawnTime", "encrTime", and "decrTime"?

  2. Would you like to use a specific color scheme for highlighting key data points
  where "msgsize" varies significantly?

  3. Do you prefer any particular style or position for text annotations to emphasize
  critical values?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds for "msgsize" changes that you would like to
  highlight?

  5. Do you have a preference for the scale of the axes (linear, logarithmic, etc.)?

  6. Is there any particular font or font size you prefer for text annotations and
  labels?

  7. Would you like to include a specific legend format or position to enhance the
  chart''s readability?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for displaying multiple metrics on the same chart?

  9. Are there any specific gridlines, markers, or additional visual elements you
  prefer to include for context?

  10. Would you like to display time and memory usage together or separately on the
  chart?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Linear scale would be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Display time and memory usage together.'
