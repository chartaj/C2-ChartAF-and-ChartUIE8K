initial_prompt: Please create a box plot comparing the encryption and decryption times
  for different 'nprimes' values from the dataset. Include 'spawnTime' for context.
  Utilize the "N Primes Based RSA Variant Analysis" data, focusing on performance
  metrics. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Would you like to display individual data points as well as the box plot summary
  statistics?

  3. Do you prefer the box plots to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  4. Should the median, quartiles, and outliers be explicitly labeled on the chart?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the background for easier comparison across different
  ''nprimes'' values?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?

  7. Would you like to use a logarithmic scale for any of the axes to handle extreme
  values better?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  classic, modern)?

  9. Should the legend describe the different colors for ''encrTime'' and ''decrTime''?

  10. Do you have a preferred title and axis labels for the chart?

  11. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as sample
  sizes, in the chart?'
