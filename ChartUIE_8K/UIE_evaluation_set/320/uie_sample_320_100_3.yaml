initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the RSA variant performance. Use
  'spawnTime', 'encrTime', and 'decrTime' as Y-axis values on three different lines.
  Plot 'nbits' on the X-axis to observe how processing times vary with different bit
  sizes. Since this is relevant to cryptocurrency and blockchain applications, ensure
  clarity in time metrics. Use distinct colors for each line and a legend for easy
  interpretation. The chart should help understand the efficiency of the RSA variant
  in terms of encryption and decryption times as the bit length increases. Avoid clutter;
  focus on trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the style of line (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted) for each metric?

  2. What colors would you prefer for each line representing ''spawnTime'', ''encrTime'',
  and ''decrTime''?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preference for the chart labels and
  title?

  5. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines; if so, what style
  (e.g., circle, square, triangle) do you prefer?

  6. How would you like the X-axis and Y-axis labels to be formatted?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the grid lines (e.g., color, line style,
  presence)?

  8. Should the chart include a title? If yes, what should it be?

  9. Do you prefer any specific margin settings around the chart?

  10. Would you like to highlight or annotate any particular data points or trends
  on the chart?'
