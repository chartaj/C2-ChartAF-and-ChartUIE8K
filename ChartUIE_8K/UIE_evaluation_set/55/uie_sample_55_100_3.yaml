initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to "Human Stress Detection in and through
  Sleep," focusing on various physiological parameters like respiratory rate, heart
  rate, etc. I need a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two variables,
  'rr' (respiratory rate) and 'hr' (heart rate). No missing values are present, so
  please plot all available data points. Since the purpose is to understand stress
  detection through sleep patterns, make the chart as clear as possible to identify
  any potential correlations or outliers between respiratory rate and heart rate.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color of the data points?

  2. Do you wish to differentiate data points based on any specific criteria, like
  color or shape, to highlight additional information?

  3. Would you prefer to have gridlines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific range you would like to set for either the x-axis or y-axis
  to focus on certain values?

  5. Do you require axis labels to be formatted in a particular way, such as including
  units (like bpm for heart rate)?

  6. Would you like to include a trend line to better visualize the correlation between
  respiratory rate and heart rate?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or style of the chart title
  or axis labels?

  8. Are there specific annotations or data labels you want to highlight on the scatter
  plot?

  9. Would you like to include a legend if you are categorizing data points differently?

  10. Do you require any particular font style or size for chart text to ensure readability?'
