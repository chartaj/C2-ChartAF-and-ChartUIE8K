initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between all variables (sr,
  rr, t, lm, bo, rem, sr.1, hr, sl) highlighting high-stress phases during sleep.
  Use text annotations to show exact values. Visualize data trends for sleep quality
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to be displayed with a specific color gradient for
  different correlation values?

  3. Should we include any specific labels or titles for the axes other than the variable
  names?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations showing
  exact correlation values?

  5. Are there any specific ranges of correlation values (e.g., high stress) that
  you would like visually emphasized?

  6. Do you have a particular layout preference for the heatmap, such as the size
  or aspect ratio?

  7. Would you like the color scale to be continuous or segmented based on correlation
  value ranges?

  8. Should any specific data points or ranges be highlighted in the heatmap for further
  emphasis?

  9. Is there any additional information you would like displayed along with the heatmap,
  such as legends or tooltips?

  10. Are there any preferences for the background color or styling of the heatmap
  to enhance readability?'
