initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the 'Human Stress Detection
  in and through Sleep' data. Use the dataset from ../Extra_datas/data/55.csv. The
  chart should plot 'sr', 'rr', 't', 'lm', 'bo', 'rem', 'sr.1', and 'hr' on the y-axis,
  with corresponding measurements along the x-axis. Highlight any key trends or patterns
  over the dataset. Focus on how these variables correlate with changes in stress
  levels and sleep stages. Ensure the axes are labeled clearly and the chart is easy
  to read for analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart?

  3. How would you prefer the different variables (''sr'', ''rr'', ''t'', etc.) to
  be distinguished on the chart (e.g., different line styles, colors, markers)?

  4. Are there any specific trends or patterns you want to be highlighted or annotated
  on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific scale (linear vs. logarithmic) for the y-axis?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate the variables, and if so,
  where should it be placed?

  7. Are there any specific intervals or ranges on the x-axis that you want to emphasize
  or zoom in on?

  8. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If yes, do you have a preference
  for what it should say?

  9. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and title?

  10. Do you need any specific labeling or annotations for significant data points
  or events in the dataset?'
