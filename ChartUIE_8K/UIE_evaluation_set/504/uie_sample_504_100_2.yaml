initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the GNI (PPP) and Life Expectancy
  of Korea, Kuwait, and Kenya over the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Use different colors
  to represent each country within the bars. Annotate key values for GNI and Life
  Expectancy at points where there are significant changes or notable trends. For
  example, highlight the highest life expectancy and the lowest GNI among the countries
  in each year. The chart should help visualize economic and health trends across
  these countries, emphasizing how these factors evolve over time.
