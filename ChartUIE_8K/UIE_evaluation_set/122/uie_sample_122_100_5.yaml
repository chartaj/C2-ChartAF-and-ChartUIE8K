initial_prompt: 'Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the global sales of the top
  3 video games. The x-axis should represent the names of the games (Wii Sports, Super
  Mario Bros., Mario Kart Wii), while the y-axis should display the sales figures
  in millions. Each bar should be stacked to show the contributions from different
  regions: NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, and Other_Sales. Use different colors to
  distinguish each region and include a legend. Ensure the total height of each bar
  corresponds to the Global_Sales value. Title the chart "Global Sales Distribution
  of Top Video Games."'
