initial_prompt: Iâ€™m looking to create a bubble chart that visualizes data on video
  game sales from the provided dataset. Specifically, I want each bubble to represent
  a game, with the bubble size corresponding to the Global Sales. The x-axis should
  denote the Year of release, and the y-axis should denote NA_Sales. Color the bubbles
  based on the Genre of the game. This way, I can easily identify trends over time
  and the popularity of different genres in terms of sales. Use the sample data provided
  as a starting point.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the genres?\n2. Would you\
  \ like to include a legend explaining the genre colors?\n3. Do you have specific\
  \ axis label formats or preferences (e.g., font size, style)?\n4. Should the x-axis\
  \ be continuous or categorical?\n5. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If so,\
  \ any preference on their style?\n6. Would you like to include data point labels\
  \ or tooltips for each bubble?\n7. Do you have a preferred bubble size range or\
  \ scale factor for the Global Sales?\n8. Should we use a specific theme or style\
  \ for the chart background?\n9. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart\
  \ title and axis titles (e.g., text, font size)? \n10. Would you like to set minimum\
  \ and maximum limits for any of the axes?"
