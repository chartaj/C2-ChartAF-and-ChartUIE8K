initial_prompt: I would like an area chart illustrating the global sales trends of
  top-selling video games over the years. The x-axis should represent the years, and
  the y-axis should show the global sales in millions. There should be different colored
  areas for each video game genre, allowing for a clear comparison of their popularity
  and how sales have evolved over time. Please ensure the chart is easy to read and
  differentiated by genre.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different video game
  genres?

  2. Would you like any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  4. Is there any specific range you would like the y-axis to cover?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate the genres?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so, light
  or dark?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall size and dimensions of the chart?

  8. Should the x-axis include every year, or would you prefer specific intervals
  (e.g., every 5 years)?

  9. Are there any specific genres you want to highlight or focus on more than others?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart for significant
  trends or events?'
