initial_prompt: I have a dataset about video game sales across various platforms,
  genres, and regions. I'd like to create a treemap to visualize the global sales
  of video games. Please ensure the treemap highlights the distribution of sales across
  different genres and platforms. Use color coding to differentiate between genres,
  and size each block according to the global sales figures. Make sure to include
  labels for the top-selling games, their publishers, and release years. This will
  help in understanding the market performance and trends in the arts-and-entertainment
  sector. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  genres?

  2. How would you like the labels for top-selling games to be displayed (e.g., font
  size, style)?

  3. Is there a specific number of top-selling games you want to highlight on the
  treemap?

  4. Would you like to include any tooltips or additional information when hovering
  over the blocks?

  5. Are there any specific genres or platforms you want to be emphasized more than
  others?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know, maybe the top 10 would be fine.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.'
