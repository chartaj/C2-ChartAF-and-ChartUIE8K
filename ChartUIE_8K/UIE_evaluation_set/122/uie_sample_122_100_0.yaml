initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for video game sales data, highlighting the top
  3 games by global sales. Each bar should represent a game, with annotations displaying
  the sales figures for NA, EU, JP, Other, and Global. Use different colors to distinguish
  between the regions. Highlight the game with the highest global sales to draw attention.
  The chart aims to compare regional sales across top games while emphasizing the
  best-seller. Include data-driven and contextual annotations to aid understanding.
  This will help visualize the distribution of video game sales across different markets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  regions (NA, EU, JP, Other)?

  2. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or format of the annotations displaying
  sales figures?

  4. How would you like the game with the highest global sales to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different color, bold outline, special icon)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which
  region?

  6. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for the chart labels and
  annotations?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, what style do you prefer for
  them?

  8. Do you want the bars to be displayed in a specific order, such as descending
  order of global sales?

  9. Is there any additional information you would like to display on the chart, such
  as a title or subtitle?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart size or aspect ratio?'
