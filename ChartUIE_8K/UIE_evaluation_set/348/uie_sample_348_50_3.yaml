initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap showing the correlation between the different
  resources (columns 2-12) and total available resources for each player. Highlight
  any strong positive or negative correlations. Use the data from Settlers of Catan
  games.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like labels or annotations for the correlation values displayed directly
  on the heatmap?

  3. Should we use a specific scale (e.g., -1 to 1) for the correlation values, and
  if so, would you like this scale to be visually indicated with a legend?

  4. Do you want to highlight only the significant correlations (e.g., above 0.7 or
  below -0.7), and if so, what thresholds would you prefer?

  5. How would you like the resources to be ordered on the heatmap (e.g., in the order
  of columns, alphabetically, based on correlation strength)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size or dimensions of the heatmap?

  7. Should there be grid lines separating the cells in the heatmap?

  8. Would you prefer the heatmap to be clustered by similarity to show groupings
  of resources with similar correlations?'
