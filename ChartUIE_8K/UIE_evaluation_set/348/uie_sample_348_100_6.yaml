initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the "totalGain" distribution among
  different players in the Settlers of Catan game dataset. The chart should illustrate
  the percentage of totalGain each player accumulated across the recorded games. While
  the primary focus should be on the "totalGain" values, it would also be helpful
  to distinguish slices by the "player" identifier. This will help us understand which
  players are contributing the most towards resource gains in the game. Please include
  a legend for easy identification of each player's contribution. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the pie chart slices?

  2. Would you like the chart to display the exact percentage values on each slice?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the legend?

  4. Should we use distinct patterns or textures along with colors to differentiate
  the slices?

  5. Would you like to have a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend (e.g., right, bottom,
  left, top)?

  7. Should the slices be exploded to highlight certain players, or should they all
  be uniform?

  8. Do you prefer any specific labels or annotations on the pie chart other than
  the legend?'
