initial_prompt: Create a line chart for my Settlers of Catan games. Use 'gameNum'
  along the x-axis and plot lines for 'points', 'production', 'totalGain', and 'totalAvailable'
  for each player. The chart should help visualize the progression and performance
  of each player over different games. Include a legend to identify each player by
  their 'player' number.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing each
  player?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a grid for easier reading of values?

  3. Do you have any preference for the style of the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Would you like to include data markers (e.g., circles, squares) on the lines
  to highlight individual data points?

  5. What title would you like for the chart?

  6. Do you want any labels or annotations on specific points within the chart?

  7. How would you prefer the legend to be positioned on the chart (e.g., right, bottom,
  top, left)?

  8. Do you want specific colors assigned to particular players, or should they be
  randomly assigned?

  9. Would you like any additional information to be displayed when hovering over
  the lines, such as exact values or game details?'
