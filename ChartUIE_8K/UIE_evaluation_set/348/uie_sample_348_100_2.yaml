initial_prompt: Create a radar chart showing the performance of players in different
  games of Settlers of Catan. Visualize the 'points', 'production', 'tradeGain', 'totalGain',
  'totalLoss', and 'totalAvailable' metrics for each player. Highlight the player
  with the highest total available resources in a different color. Add data annotations
  to display the exact value of the points and total available resources on the chart
  for better comparison. This will help in understanding which player performs consistently
  well across different aspects of the game. Use distinct colors for different players
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred design or layout for displaying the radar chart?


  2. Are there any specific color schemes you prefer for the different players?


  3. How would you like the highlighted player with the highest total available resources
  to be visually distinguished (e.g., specific color, bold lines)?


  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for data annotations?


  5. Should the data annotations for ''points'' and ''total available resources''
  display any specific formatting (e.g., number of decimal places)?


  6. Do you want gridlines to be shown in the radar chart, and if so, do you have
  a preferred style for them?


  7. Should the radar chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?


  8. Are there any additional labels or titles you would like to include on the radar
  chart?


  9. Do you have preferences for the scale (e.g., logarithmic, linear) of the axes?


  10. Is there a specific order in which you want the players to be displayed on the
  radar chart?'
