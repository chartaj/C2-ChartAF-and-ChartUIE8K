initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize Settlers of Catan games data. Plot
  each player's performance with 'totalAvailable' on the x-axis and 'points' on the
  y-axis. Use annotations to highlight key values, such as highest and lowest points
  scored. Add color highlights for different 'player' categories to distinguish between
  them. The purpose is to analyze player performance and resource management over
  multiple games. Provide text annotations for data points that signify unique achievements
  or observations. The visualization should make it easy to compare players and identify
  trends in resource allocation and scoring.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different 'player' categories?\n\
  2. How would you like the annotations for key values (e.g., highest and lowest points)\
  \ to be displayed? \n3. Are there specific unique achievements or observations you\
  \ would like highlighted with text annotations?\n4. Do you have a preference for\
  \ the format or style of text annotations?\n5. Would you like any specific markers\
  \ or symbols for the data points representing different players?\n6. Do you have\
  \ any specific requirements for the title or labels of the axes?\n7. How would you\
  \ like the legend to be displayed or formatted?"
