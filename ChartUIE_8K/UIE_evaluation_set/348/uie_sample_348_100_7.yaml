initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize my Settlers of Catan games
  data. Specifically, I want to compare the total points scored by each player across
  different games. Use 'gameNum' on the x-axis and 'points' on the y-axis. Differentiate
  between players using different colors or labels. This will help me see which player
  scores the most points consistently and in which games. Additionally, if possible,
  indicate the "totalGain" and "totalLoss" as separate bar charts alongside the points
  for a more comprehensive view of each player's performance across games. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors or labels to differentiate between players?

  2. Do you want to stack the bars for totalGain and totalLoss alongside points in
  the same chart, or would you prefer separate charts for each metric?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on each bar to show the exact values?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific formatting styles for the bar chart you prefer (e.g.,
  bar width, spacing between bars)?

  6. Do you need a legend to identify the players and different metrics?

  7. How many players'' data do you typically have, and should this be kept in mind
  for visual clarity?

  8. Should we use any specific background gridlines or reference lines to enhance
  readability?

  9. Do you have a preferred order for the players, such as alphabetical or based
  on total points scored?
