  Create a heatmap visualizing player performance across games in Settlers of Catan.
  Player numbers on y-axis and game numbers on x-axis. Use color gradients to highlight
  total points, where darker shades represent higher points. Ensure the heatmap has
  clear labels and a color legend for easy understanding. Include missing data points
  as a distinct color or pattern. Summarize key stats per player. Also, compare production
  values between players using another heatmap. Make the heatmaps visually appealing
  and informative to help analyze player performance trends.
