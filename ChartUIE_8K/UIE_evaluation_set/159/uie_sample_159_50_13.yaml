initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the distribution of billionaires
  by country, based on the Forbes Richest People Dataset. Highlight countries with
  varying billionaire counts and their net worth, using color gradients to depict
  wealth concentration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or gradient for highlighting wealth
  concentration on the map?

  both?

  3. Do you want any specific annotations or labels on the map (e.g., country names,
  exact billionaire counts, or total net worth)?

  4. What level of detail should the map display? For example, should it show only
  countries or also their subdivisions?

  5. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, Albers)?

  6. Should the visualization include a legend explaining the color gradients and
  what they represent?

  7. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be emphasized or highlighted
  differently?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall design, such as font styles or sizes
  for labels and titles?'
