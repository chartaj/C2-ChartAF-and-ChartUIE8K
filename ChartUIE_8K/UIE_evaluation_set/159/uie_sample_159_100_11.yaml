initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart that tracks the net worth of the top 10 richest
  people over time, for example from the current year backwards, say 5 years ago.
  Please use the data from the 'Rank', 'Name', 'Net Worth', 'Age', 'Country', 'Source',
  and 'Industry' columns to visualize trends and changes in wealth distribution. It
  would be helpful if the line chart shows how these top individuals' net worths have
  evolved, emphasizing fluctuations or significant changes. Also, include a legend
  to differentiate each person. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors or color schemes for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display data points explicitly or should it be a
  smooth continuous line?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the appearance of the legend (e.g., position,
  size, style)?

  4. Should the X-axis specify particular intervals (e.g., months, quarters) within
  each year?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for font style or size for axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Would you like to include annotations for significant changes or events impacting
  net worth?

  8. Should the lines for each individual be dashed, dotted, or solid?

  9. Is there a specific way youâ€™d like to highlight the top 1 or 2 individuals''
  net worths more prominently?

  10. Do you have any specific aspect ratios or dimensions in mind for the chart?'
