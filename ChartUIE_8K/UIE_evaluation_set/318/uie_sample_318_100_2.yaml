initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the ratings of the hotels in Munnar,
  Kerala, as presented by MakeMyTrip. Use the columns 'Hotel Name', 'Rating', and
  'Star Rating' for the heatmap. Text Annotations should highlight the 'Rating Description'
  and 'Reviews'. Color code the heatmap based on the 'Rating' values to visually distinguish
  higher-rated hotels. This will help in quickly identifying the top-rated hotels
  and comparing their reviews and star ratings. The purpose is to find the best-rated
  hotels and see the correlation between ratings and reviews.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color gradient to be linear or segmented?

  3. What specific range of ''Rating'' values should have more distinct colors, if
  any?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for text annotations?

  5. Should the hotels be sorted in a particular order (e.g., by ''Rating'', ''Star
  Rating'', or ''Reviews'')?

  6. Do you want any specific scale (e.g., log scale) to be used for the ''Reviews''
  count?

  7. Is there a maximum or minimum ''Rating'' value that you want to highlight or
  focus on?

  8. Would you like to include tooltips when hovering over the heatmap cells for additional
  information?

  10. Do you have a preference for the layout or size of the heatmap?'
