initial_prompt: I want a line chart visualizing hotel price trends in Munnar, Kerala.
  Use "Hotel Name" on the x-axis and "Price" on the y-axis. Represent different star
  ratings (3-star, 4-star) with distinct lines to compare how prices vary across hotels
  with different ratings. Make sure to show the price including tax for accuracy.
  This helps in choosing hotels based on budget and star rating. For missing "Star
  Rating," do not exclude data but maybe mark as "Unrated" to retain completeness.
  Ensure the chart is clear and labels are readable for easier decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct lines representing
  different star ratings?

  2. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and axis titles?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the data?

  4. Do you have a specific format for displaying prices (e.g., currency symbols,
  comma separators)?

  5. Should the "Unrated" category be labeled in a particular way or with a specific
  color?

  6. Would you like to include data points or markers on the lines for precise values?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart title text and positioning?

  8. Should there be a legend describing the star ratings, and if so, where should
  it be placed?'
