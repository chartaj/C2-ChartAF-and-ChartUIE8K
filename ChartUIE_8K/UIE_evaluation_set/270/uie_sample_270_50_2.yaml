initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the High Temp (째F) and Low Temp (째F)
  over time. Annotate significant temperature differences and days with the highest
  and lowest bike crossings. Highlight weekends for context. Ensure visibility of
  precipitation on secondary axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the line chart and highlighted
  elements (e.g., weekends, annotations)?

  2. How would you like the significant temperature differences to be annotated (e.g.,
  text labels, markers)?

  3. What specific format do you prefer for displaying the precipitation on the secondary
  axis (e.g., bars, line)?

  4. Are there any specific styles or themes you prefer for the overall chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, colorful)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where do you prefer it to be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. How would you like weekends to be highlighted (e.g., shaded background, different
  line style)?

  7. Should there be any specific limits or ranges set for the y-axes (temperature
  and precipitation)?

  8. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart, and if so, which ones (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical)?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  10. Do you want the data points to be displayed as markers on the lines, or do you
  prefer a smooth line without them?'
