initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of bicycle
  crossings over the four East River bridges in New York City. Use the data for Brooklyn
  Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, and Queensboro Bridge. We're interested
  in understanding the variability and central tendency for each bridge. The x-axis
  should represent the bridge names, while the y-axis should show the number of bicycle
  crossings. Ensure the plot includes labels and a title. This will help us analyze
  and compare the typical bicycle crossing patterns on these major bridges.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the box plots representing each
  bridge?

  2. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the plot (e.g., modern, classic)?

  3. Should any specific data points, such as outliers, be highlighted?

  4. Would you like to display the median value prominently on each box plot?

  5. Should the whiskers of the box plot extend to show the data range or a specific
  percentile?

  6. Do you need any additional grid lines or tick marks on the plot for better readability?

  7. Should the labels on the x-axis (bridge names) or y-axis (number of bicycle crossings)
  have any specific formatting or rotation for clarity?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or additional information to the plot?'
