initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the average daily bicycle crossings
  for each bridge in New York City, segmented by days and temperature ranges. Use
  the data from the provided CSV file, focusing on the Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan
  Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, and Queensboro Bridge columns. Highlight variations
  based on High Temperature (°F) and Precipitation levels. This should help in urban
  planning by showing how weather affects bicycle traffic across these bridges. Make
  it easy to compare traffic patterns across different conditions and time periods.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should the temperature ranges be divided into specific intervals? If so, please
  specify the preferred intervals.

  3. How would you like the precipitation levels to be categorized in the heatmap
  (e.g., low, medium, high)?

  4. Do you have any preferred labeling styles for the axes and legends?

  5. Would you like to include tooltips to display exact values when hovering over
  the heatmap cells?

  6. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the text in the heatmap?

  8. Is there a specific date range or subset of data you want to focus on for the
  heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer to normalize the bicycle crossing data (e.g., by using average
  or total for each day)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include to
  highlight specific events or days?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color scheme preferences.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe every 10°F increment would be good.

  3. I am not sure, perhaps categorized into low, medium, and high.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for labeling styles.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I do not have any preferences for the font style or size.

  8. I am not sure, please use the full dataset.

  9. Yes, using the average for each day would be good.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
