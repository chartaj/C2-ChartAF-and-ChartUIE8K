initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the bicycle crossings data for
  the four bridges in NYC over various dates. Highlight values corresponding to high
  and low temperatures, and annotate the points with precipitation data to understand
  the relationship between weather and bicycle use.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different elements in
  the scatter plot (e.g., temperature ranges, bridges)?

  2. How would you like the points to be annotated with precipitation data (e.g.,
  tooltip on hover, direct labeling)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular shape or marker for the scatter plot points?

  4. Would you like the scatter plot to have a title and axis labels? If so, please
  specify.

  5. Is there a specific range of dates you are most interested in analyzing?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate the data points corresponding
  to different bridges or temperature ranges?

  8. Are there any specific highlights or thresholds you would like to be marked (e.g.,
  high/low temperature cutoffs)?

  9. Would you like to include any gridlines or background shading to aid in interpreting
  the data?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to have displayed
  along with the scatter plot?'
