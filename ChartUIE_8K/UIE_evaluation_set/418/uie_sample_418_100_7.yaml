initial_prompt: I have data on malaria death rates from 1990 to 2016. I need a bubble
  chart to visualize this. Each bubble should represent a country, with the x-axis
  showing the years from 1990 to 2016, and the y-axis displaying the death rates per
  100,000 people. The size of the bubbles should indicate the number of deaths. Please
  include all available countries in the dataset and ensure to highlight trends over
  these years. Missing values can be excluded.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubbles representing different
  countries?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to identify each country, or do you prefer
  to hover over bubbles to see the country name?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the x-axis and y-axis to enhance readability?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis titles and labels?

  5. Should the chart include a title and subtitles? If so, do you have specific wording
  in mind?

  6. Do you want to highlight specific countries or regions in the chart?

  7. Would you like to add annotations or data labels to indicate significant events
  or data points?

  8. Should the chart have a specific size or aspect ratio?

  9. Do you prefer the bubbles to be semi-transparent to better view overlapping data
  points?

  10. Would you like to include a trend line to show the overall trend in death rates?'
