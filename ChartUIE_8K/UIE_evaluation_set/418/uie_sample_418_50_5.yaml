initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the malaria death rates per
  100,000 people from 1990 to 2016. Focus on the age-standardized rates for both sexes
  across different countries. This will help in understanding the trends and changes
  in malaria deaths over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the line chart?

  2. How would you like different countries to be represented (e.g., different line
  styles or colors)?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify different countries?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  5. Are there specific axes titles you would like to use?

  6. Would you prefer to include data markers on the lines for each year?

  7. Should gridlines be included for better readability?

  8. Do you want to display the range of years on the x-axis evenly spaced, or do
  you have specific intervals in mind (e.g., every 5 years)?

  9. How should missing data be treated in the visualization (e.g., interpolate, leave
  gaps, or exclude)?

  10. Would you like to highlight any specific year or range of years on the chart?

  11. Should trend lines or additional statistical summaries be included to assist
  in interpreting the data?

  12. Are there any specific countries you would like to focus on or prioritize in
  the visualization?'
