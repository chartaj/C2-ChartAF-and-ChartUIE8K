initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the age-standardized malaria death
  rates from 1990 to 2016. Highlight significant fluctuations in the data to understand
  trends better. Add text annotations for key years to focus on critical changes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  2. Should the x-axis be labeled with increments for each year or in larger intervals
  (e.g., every 5 years)?

  3. Are there specific colors you would like to use for highlighting significant
  fluctuations?

  4. Do you have preferences for the font style or size for text annotations?

  5. Should the y-axis have a specific range or automatically adjust to fit the data?

  6. Would you like to include a title or subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  it be?

  7. Do you want to display gridlines on the chart? If yes, do you prefer them on
  both axes or only one?

  8. Should we include a legend, or are the labels and annotations sufficient?

  9. Is there a specific style or appearance you prefer for the highlighted areas
  to focus on significant fluctuations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Every year.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Automatically adjust to fit the data.

  6. Include a title: "Trends in Age-Standardized Malaria Death Rates (1990-2016)"

  7. Yes, display gridlines on both axes.

  8. Labels and annotations are sufficient.

  9. I do not know.'
