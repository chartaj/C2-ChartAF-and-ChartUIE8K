initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the malaria death rates from 1990 to
  2016 across various countries. Highlight the years with the highest death rates
  and annotate the peak values to focus viewersâ€™ attention. The chart should differentiate
  by country using color coding to enhance comparison. Provide context on how malaria
  death rates have changed over time and include non-data-driven annotations to offer
  insights about significant historical or medical events that might have impacted
  these rates. This approach aims to emphasize trends and critical peaks in malaria
  death rates worldwide.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the countries?

  2. How would you like the peak values to be annotated (e.g., specific labels, different
  colors, or markers)?

  3. Are there specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the histogram (e.g.,
  vertical bars vs. horizontal bars)?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included to help differentiate the countries?

  6. Are there specific historical or medical events you would like to be highlighted
  in the annotations?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for the gridlines and axis labels (e.g., dashed
  lines, bold lines)?

  8. Would you like any additional contextual or explanatory text to be included on
  the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific chart title or subtitle to be included?

  10. Are there any particular countries you want to be emphasized more clearly in
  the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Specific labels for the peak values would be great.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Vertical bars.

  5. Yes, a legend should be included.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. A title like "Malaria Death Rates (1990-2016)" and a subtitle that mentions the
  countries compared would be nice.

  10. I would like the countries with the highest death rates to be emphasized more
  clearly.'
