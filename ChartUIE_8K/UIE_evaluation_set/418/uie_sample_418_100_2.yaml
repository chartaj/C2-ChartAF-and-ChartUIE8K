initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the Malaria death rates from 1990 to
  2016 for various countries. Focus on annotations for notable years or significant
  changes. The visualization should highlight countries with the highest and lowest
  rates, drawing attention to critical data points. Use color intensity to represent
  death rates per 100,000 people, ensuring a clear distinction between different rates.
  Annotations should provide insights into trends or anomalies. The heatmap will help
  identify patterns and shifts in Malaria mortality, aiding health strategies and
  policy-making. Show both data-driven annotations and general comments for context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for the heatmap to represent
  different Malaria death rates?

  2. Do you prefer the annotations to be in a specific format or style?

  3. Are there any particular countries or regions you want to highlight or focus
  on in the heatmap?

  4. For highlighting notable years or significant changes, do you have specific events
  or thresholds in mind?

  5. Would you like to include any additional data layers or references in the heatmap
  for context?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for how the countries and years should be organized
  in the heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific insights or trends you are particularly interested in
  highlighting in the annotations?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  2. I am not sure about the format or style of the annotations.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for countries or regions to highlight.

  4. I do not have specific events or thresholds in mind for notable years or changes.

  5. I am not sure about including any additional data layers or references.

  6. I do not have a preferred layout for organizing the countries and years.

  7. I am particularly interested in highlighting any significant decreases in mortality
  rates that could indicate successful health interventions.'
