initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to compare the average GPA and Attendance
  Rate by Major. Use different colors to represent GPA and Attendance Rate respectively.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the different Majors from the dataset, and the y-axis
  shows the average values. Each Major column should be divided into two segments,
  one for GPA and one for Attendance rate, making it easy to compare these metrics
  across different Majors. Add legend for clarity and ensure the visual is easily
  interpretable. The purpose is to examine if there is any significant performance
  disparity among different Majors.
