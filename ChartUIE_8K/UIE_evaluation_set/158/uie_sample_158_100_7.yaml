initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the distribution of StudyHoursPerWeek
  and GPA based on different Genders and Majors from the Student Performance Dataset.
  This will help understand how study hours and GPA vary among male and female students
  in different majors. Additionally, please include outliers in the box chart to identify
  any extreme values. The box chart should be easy to interpret with clear labels,
  a legend, and appropriate titles for each axis and the chart itself. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different genders or
  majors in the box chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific style or formatting for the labels on the axes?

  3. How would you like the legend to be displayed (e.g., position, format)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the chart''s titles
  and labels?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales you would like to set for the axes?

  6. Do you require any specific notations or highlights for outliers in the box chart?

  7. Would you like to include any specific captions or annotations within the chart?'
