initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the correlation between
  StudyHoursPerWeek and GPA for students. Annotate key data points like the highest
  and lowest GPA values, and highlight data points based on their majors using different
  colors. Make sure to include a legend that identifies each major. Additionally,
  depict AttendanceRate by size variation in the scatter plot markers to add another
  layer of insight. The practical purpose is to find out how study habits and attendance
  can impact academic performance across different disciplines. Use the full dataset
  for comprehensive analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the majors?

  2. Would you like specific formatting or placement for the annotations of the highest
  and lowest GPA values?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for titles, labels,
  and legend?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, in which style (dotted, solid,
  etc.)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the axis ranges or should they be auto-calculated
  from the data?

  6. How would you like outliers to be handled or highlighted?

  7. Would you prefer any specific shapes for the scatter plot markers besides the
  default circles?

  8. Is there a particular way you would like the legend to be formatted or positioned
  within the plot?

  9. Do you have specific labels or titles in mind for the axes and chart?'
