questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you like to use to differentiate between students with
  part-time jobs and those without?

  3. Should the histogram be normalized to show relative frequencies instead of raw
  counts?

  4. Do you want to include axis labels and titles? If so, do you have specific wording
  in mind?

  5. Should any specific statistical information (mean, median, mode) be highlighted
  on the histogram?

  and without part-time jobs)?

  to be displayed?
