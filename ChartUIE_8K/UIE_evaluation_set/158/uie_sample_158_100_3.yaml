initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to showcase the correlation between StudyHoursPerWeek
  and GPA for students. The x-axis should represent StudyHoursPerWeek, ranging from
  the minimum to the maximum values found in the dataset, while the y-axis should
  represent GPA values. This chart should help visualize if there's a trend between
  how many hours students study per week and their academic performance as measured
  by their GPA. Please ensure the chart covers the entire dataset for a comprehensive
  analysis. Also, include data points for clarity and consider differentiating between
  majors if possible. Thanks!

  2. How would you like the majors to be differentiated (e.g., unique colors, different
  line styles)?

  3. Should the data points be labeled with specific values or just represented by
  markers?

  4. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If so, where would you prefer it
  to be placed?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, do you have any specific
  text in mind?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights on the chart to denote key
  observations or trends?
