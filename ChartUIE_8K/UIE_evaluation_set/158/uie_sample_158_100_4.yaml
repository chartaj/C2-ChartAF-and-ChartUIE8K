initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualizing the correlation between students' GPA
  and several factors like Study Hours Per Week, Attendance Rate, Age, and whether
  they have a Part-Time Job or participate in Extra-Curricular Activities. The data
  is from a student performance dataset. Please ensure that the different variables
  are clearly labeled and the intensity of the colors helps to easily understand the
  strength and direction of the correlations. Also, indicate any significant trends
  or patterns on the heatmap. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used in the
  heatmap?

  2. Would you like to highlight certain correlation thresholds on the heatmap (e.g.,
  high correlations in bold or a different color)?

  3. Do you want the correlation coefficients to be displayed on the cells of the
  heatmap?

  4. Is there a specific ordering of variables you would prefer on the axes?

  5. Do you have any preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included that explains the color intensity in terms
  of correlation strength?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to add to the heatmap
  to clarify trends or patterns?

  8. Is there a specific way you would prefer significant trends or patterns to be
  indicated on the heatmap (e.g., text annotations, color changes)?

  9. Do you want the heatmap to include grid lines to separate cells?'
