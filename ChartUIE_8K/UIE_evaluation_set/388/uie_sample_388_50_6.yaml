initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing CO2 Emissions vs. Forest Area for
  different countries. Use bubble size to represent CO2 emissions magnitude.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the bubbles and background?

  2. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the chart labels and
  titles?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability? If
  so, do you have a preferred style for the grid lines?

  4. Should the names of each country be displayed on or near the corresponding bubbles?

  5. Do you prefer a legend to be displayed, explaining the bubble sizes?

  6. Would you like to include axis titles? If so, do you have a preferred phrasing
  for them?

  7. Do you have a specific range in mind for the x-axis (Forest Area) or y-axis (CO2
  Emissions), or should these be auto-scaled based on the data?

  8. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight
  particular data points or trends?'
