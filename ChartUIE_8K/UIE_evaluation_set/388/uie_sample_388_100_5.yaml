initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the CO2 emissions and forest
  area by country from the provided dataset. Use the 'Country' as the x-axis, with
  the levels 'CO2 Emissions' and 'ForestArea' stacked for each country. Since the
  data pertains to environmental science, please ensure the chart is clear and easy
  to interpret, highlighting the relationship between CO2 emissions and forest area.
  Make sure to label the axes and provide a legend to distinguish between CO2 emissions
  and forest area. Don't forget to include the country names on the x-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  ''CO2 Emissions'' and ''Forest Area'' in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and country
  names?

  3. Do you want to add data labels on each bar segment for CO2 emissions and forest
  area values?

  4. Would you prefer the chart to be in a specific orientation, such as horizontal
  instead of vertical?

  5. Are there any specific guidelines or standards for visualization that we should
  follow, especially considering the audience?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or highlights to emphasize
  certain countries or values?'
