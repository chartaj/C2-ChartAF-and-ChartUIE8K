initial_prompt: 'Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the CO2 Emissions
  and Forest Area by Country data. The chart should display each country on the x-axis,
  with two bars per country: one representing CO2 emissions and the other showing
  forest area. Ensure the CO2 emissions are in a different color than the forest area
  for clear distinction. The y-axis should have a dual scale to accommodate the vastly
  different magnitudes of emissions and forest areas. Include a legend that indicates
  which color corresponds to CO2 emissions and which to forest area. Title the chart
  appropriately and label the axes.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the CO2 emissions bars?

  2. Do you have a specific color preference for the forest area bars?

  3. How would you like the dual-axis scales to be formatted or labeled?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Is there a specific format for the legend placement or appearance that you prefer?

  6. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or order in a particular
  way?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the background color or gridline style of the
  chart?'
