initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize the environmental data for different
  countries. Plot CO2 Emissions and Forest Area for each country on individual axes
  to compare their environmental impact. Ensure the radar chart highlights the differences
  between countries like the United States, China, and India. The chart should clearly
  show the emission levels and forest areas, helping us understand the balance between
  industrial activity and green areas. Include ten countries in the plot to make comparisons
  comprehensive. Make sure all data points and axes are labeled for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors or themes for the radar
  chart?

  2. Would you like to include annotations or data labels directly on the chart?

  3. How would you like the countries to be ordered on the radar chart (alphabetically,
  by CO2 emissions, by forest area, etc.)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the number of grid lines or the range intervals
  on the axes?

  5. Should the chart include a legend or any additional explanatory text?

  6. Do you want the axes to be scaled in any specific way (e.g., logarithmic scale
  for CO2 emissions)?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  8. Would you like to highlight or emphasize any specific countries within the radar
  chart?'
