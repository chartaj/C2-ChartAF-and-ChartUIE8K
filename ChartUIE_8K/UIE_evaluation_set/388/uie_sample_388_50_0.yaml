initial_prompt: Visualize CO2 Emissions and Forest Area by Country using a donut chart.
  Highlight the top three emitters and largest forest areas. Add annotations to specify
  the exact emissions and forest areas for these highlighted countries. This will
  emphasize environmental impact.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors or color scheme for highlighting the
  top three emitters and largest forest areas?

  2. Would you like the chart to display percentages, absolute numbers, or both?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., inside the chart segments,
  outside with lines pointing to segments)?

  4. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for text and annotations?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or legends to be included in the chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific order for the countries to be displayed (e.g., highest
  to lowest emissions)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
