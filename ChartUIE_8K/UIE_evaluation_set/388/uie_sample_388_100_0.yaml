initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Create a donut chart visualizing CO2 Emissions by Country, using colors or highlights
  to emphasize the top three emitters: the United States, China, and India. Annotate
  these countries to display exact emission values, focusing attention on their contribution.
  Include a second donut chart for Forest Area by Country, similarly highlighting
  and annotating the same three countries to show the contrast. This visualization
  will highlight the environmental impact by displaying both emissions and forest
  coverage clearly.

  <end of the instruction>'
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for highlighting the top three
  emitters in the donut chart?

  2. How would you like the annotations for emission values to be displayed? (e.g.,
  font size, color, position)

  3. Do you prefer any particular theme or style for the charts to ensure consistency
  and clarity?

  4. Should the donut charts include legends or any additional labels to enhance understanding
  of the data?

  5. Are there any specific design elements you would like to avoid in these charts?

  6. Is there a preferred order for displaying the countries in the donut charts?

  7. Would you like the charts to be accompanied by any explanatory text to provide
  context or highlight key points?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the donut charts?

  9. Should the charts include percentage values or just the exact values of emissions
  and forest areas?

  10. Do you have a specific background color preference for the charts?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. I would like the annotations to be clearly visible, maybe in bold font and a
  contrasting color, positioned close to the country sections.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, including legends or additional labels would be helpful.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a preferred order for displaying the countries.

  7. Yes, some explanatory text to provide context or highlight key points would be
  beneficial.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the size or aspect ratio.

  9. Including percentage values along with the exact values would be great.
