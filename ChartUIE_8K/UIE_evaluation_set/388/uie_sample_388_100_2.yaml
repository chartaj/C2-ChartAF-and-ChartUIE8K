initial_prompt: Create a column chart to illustrate CO2 Emissions and Forest Area
  by Country. Highlight significant differences in CO2 emissions and forest areas
  among the countries. Use text annotations to emphasize key nations like the United
  States, China, and India to draw attention to their specific data points. This will
  help visualize the environmental impacts of different countries, making it easier
  to compare their contributions to CO2 emissions and forest conservation efforts.
  The purpose is to understand environmental metrics across countries for better awareness
  and action planning.
