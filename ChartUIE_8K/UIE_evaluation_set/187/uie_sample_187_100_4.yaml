initial_prompt: I want to visualize the performance of Marvel superhero movies
  using parallel coordinates. The chart should display attributes such as film title,
  category, worldwide gross, budget, critics' and audience scores, opening weekend
  gross, % gross from opening weekend, and year. This will help to compare how different
  movies within the Marvel universe perform across various metrics. Please include
  all the data points from the given dataset to provide a comprehensive view. This
  will allow for easy comparison and analysis of trends between different Marvel superhero
  films.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the
  parallel coordinates chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific order for displaying the data attributes on the parallel
  coordinates chart?

  3. Would you like to highlight any particular movies or categories within the visualization?

  4. Do you have any preference for the scale (linear or logarithmic) for any of the
  numerical axes?

  5. Would you like to include a legend in the chart to distinguish between different
  categories or attributes?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the appearance of lines (e.g., solid,
  dashed) or their opacity on the chart?

  7. Are there any reference lines or markers you would like to include to indicate
  significant values or thresholds?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style and size for axis labels
  and titles?

  9. Would you like to include interactive tooltips or labels for better readability
  of specific data points?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or textual descriptions you would like
  to include on the chart for better context?'
