initial_prompt: I'd like a Treemap chart that visualizes the "Marvel Superhero Movies"
  dataset. This chart should display the different categories of films (like "Ant-Man,"
  "Avengers") as separate sections. Each section should be sized based on the "worldwide
  gross ($m)" values of the films. Additionally, color-code the sections by the "critics
  % score" to see the correlation between the critics' scores and the gross earnings.
  This will help in understanding how well different categories and movies within
  those categories performed financially and critically.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How should the colors be assigned based on ''critics % score'' (e.g., high to
  low, specific color grades)?

  3. Should there be a legend explaining the color-coding of ''critics % score''?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the labeling of sections (e.g., show
  gross earnings, critics score, both)?

  5. Would you like to include tooltips with additional information on hover?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart labels?

  7. Should the sections be sorted in any particular order (e.g., by gross earnings,
  alphabetical)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. High to low.

  3. Yes, there should be a legend.

  4. Show both gross earnings and critics score.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. By gross earnings.'
