initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of hotel categories
  in India. Highlight the slice representing the most common category. Use text annotations
  to show the exact percentage for each category on the chart. This visualization
  will help in understanding the variety and prevalence of different hotel categories
  across various states and cities in India. Make sure to include the total number
  of hotels for additional context. This will be useful for travel industry analysis
  and market research.

  4. Should the chart have a title? If so, what should it be?

  leader lines?

  from the most common category?
