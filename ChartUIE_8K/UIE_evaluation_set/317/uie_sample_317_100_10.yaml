initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap for the "Hotels in India Dataset
  (2023)" that indicates the density of hotel locations across various cities. Use
  the columns "City" for positioning, "Total Rooms" for the density metric, and differentiate
  by "Category" using color gradients. Ensure major cities and popular tourist destinations
  are highlighted. If possible, add filters to toggle between different "State" views.
  The time period from "Start Date" to "Expiry Date" can be included as a timeline
  slider to see changes over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or color gradients to differentiate
  hotel categories?

  2. What specific cities or regions do you consider as major cities and popular tourist
  destinations that need to be highlighted?

  3. Do you prefer the heatmap to show absolute numbers or normalized densities when
  representing "Total Rooms"?

  4. How granular do you want the timeline slider to be (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
  yearly)?

  5. Is there a preferred starting and ending point on the timeline slider?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or labels on the map for key locations
  or data points?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map''s base style (e.g., satellite view, street
  map, minimalistic)?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for labels and annotations?'
