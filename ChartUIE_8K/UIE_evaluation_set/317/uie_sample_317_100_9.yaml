initial_prompt: Please create a table chart to visualize data from the Hotels in India
  Dataset. The table should include columns for S.No., State, City, Category, Alcohol,
  Hotel Name, Address, Start Date, Expiry Date, and Total Rooms. I want to see a clear
  breakdown of this information so that the hotel details are easily comprehensible.
  This will help me in analyzing the hotel distribution, their ratings, and room availability.
  The summary statistics like Unique values, Data types, and Missing values for each
  column should be included to get a better insight into the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the column width or alignment
  in the table chart?

  2. Would you like the table chart to include sorting options for any columns?

  3. Should the column headers be styled in a particular way (e.g., bold, colored)?

  4. Do you prefer the rows to be alternated with different background colors for
  better readability?

  5. Would you like to highlight any specific column or data within the table?

  6. Should the summary statistics (Unique values, Data types, and Missing values)
  be placed at the top, bottom, or in a separate section of the table?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the table
  chart?

  8. Do you want to include any tooltips or comments for explaining certain data points
  in the table?'
