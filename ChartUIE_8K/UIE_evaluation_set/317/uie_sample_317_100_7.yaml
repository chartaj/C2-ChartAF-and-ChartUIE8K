initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the Hotels in India dataset. The treemap
  should categorize hotels by State and further by City. Each block should represent
  a hotel, and the size of the block should correspond to the number of Total Rooms
  available in the hotel. Additionally, use different colors to differentiate between
  the Categories of hotels (1 Star, 2 Star, 3 Star, 4 Star, 5 Star). Ensure to include
  the Hotel Name within each block when possible and indicate if Alcohol is served.
  This will help in identifying trends and distributions of hotel categories and room
  availability across different states and cities in India.

  hotel category (1 Star, 2 Star, 3 Star, 4 Star, 5 Star)?

  2. Are there any specific color schemes or palettes you would like us to use?

  3. Do you want to include any specific fonts or text styles for hotel names within

  the block or as an icon/symbol?

  5. How detailed would you like the labeling of each block to be (e.g., full hotel
  name vs. an abbreviated version)?

  6. Should there be any additional annotations or legends to explain the chart elements?

  7. Are there any size constraints or aspect ratio preferences for the treemap visualization?

  8. Would you like any specific hierarchy levels or groupings beyond State and City?'
