initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the total number of hotel rooms over
  time for different cities in India. Highlight key points where significant changes
  occur, such as spikes or drops in total rooms. Annotate the chart with specific
  hotel names and their addresses at these key points to provide context. The purpose
  of this visualization is to track the growth or decline of hotel rooms availability
  in various cities, helping travel enthusiasts, researchers, and policymakers understand
  trends in the hospitality industry. Use colorful lines to differentiate between
  cities and ensure annotations are clear and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  cities?

  2. Are there any specific cities you want to focus on or include in the visualization?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the annotations (e.g., font size, color,
  or background)?

  4. How detailed do you want the annotations to be? Should they include any additional
  information beyond hotel names and addresses?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for better readability?

  6. Are there any specific date ranges you want to display on the X-axis?

  7. Do you prefer a specific format for the date labels on the X-axis (e.g., month/year,
  only year)?

  8. Should the Y-axis start at zero or would you like a different starting point
  to emphasize changes?

  9. Is there a preferred position for the legend on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  10. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart and
  axes?'

  5. Yes, I would like to include grid lines for better readability.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Only year labels on the X-axis would be fine.

  8. The Y-axis should start at zero.

  9. I do not know.

  10. The chart title could be "Trend of Hotel Room Availability in Major Indian Cities"
