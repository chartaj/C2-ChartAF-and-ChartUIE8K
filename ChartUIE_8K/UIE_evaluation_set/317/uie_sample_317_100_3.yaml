initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart using the Hotels in India Dataset
  for 2023. I want to compare the number of hotel rooms available across different
  cities in Gujarat and Delhi. Group the data by city and show the total number of
  rooms for each city. Make sure the chart shows a clear comparison between cities
  in the two states. Highlight the cities with the highest and lowest number of rooms
  for better visualization. Also, include labels for the total number of rooms on
  top of each bar for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the grouped column chart?

  2. Would you like specific colors for Gujarat and Delhi to differentiate them clearly?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels on top of each bar?

  4. Do you want the cities with the highest and lowest number of rooms to have distinct
  colors or any specific highlighting techniques?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you want the cities to be arranged (e.g.,
  by the number of rooms from highest to lowest)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate the cities in Gujarat and
  Delhi, or would you prefer a different approach?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for the gridlines in the chart (e.g., dashed, dotted,
  solid)?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or notes on the chart for clarity?'
