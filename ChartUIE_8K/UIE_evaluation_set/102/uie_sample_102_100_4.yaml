initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the pricing trends of different
  perfume brands over time. Use the 'old_price' and 'new_price' columns to plot the
  prices for each brand, differentiating between them using different line styles
  or colors. Include the 'ml' information to show bottle size variations. The x-axis
  should represent the brands while the y-axis should indicate the prices. Additionally,
  incorporate 'item_rating' as a secondary y-axis to observe if there's any correlation
  between price changes and customer ratings. The context is perfume products in the
  fashion and beauty industry.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the chart title?

  2. Do you have specific line styles or colors in mind for differentiating the brands?

  3. How would you like the bottle sizes (''ml'') to be displayed in the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. What range or specific starting point would you like for the y-axes (prices and
  ratings)?

  6. Would you like to include any gridlines or background colors?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart text?'
