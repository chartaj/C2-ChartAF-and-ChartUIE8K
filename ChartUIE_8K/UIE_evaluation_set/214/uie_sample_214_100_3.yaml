  I want a box chart visualizing the relationship between suicide numbers and population
  across different age groups and genders. Please use the WHO Suicide Statistics data.
  Let''s identify any outliers in the suicide rates over the years for various countries
  by breaking it down into male and female categories and across different age ranges.
  Highlight the distribution and spread of suicide numbers within these groups. Ensure
  the chart clearly represents data over the years to observe any trends or anomalies.
