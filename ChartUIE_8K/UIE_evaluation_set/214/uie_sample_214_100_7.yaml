initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart using the WHO Suicide Statistics dataset
  to compare the number of suicides between different age groups and years for both
  males and females. Ensure that the x-axis represents the age groups, the y-axis
  represents the number of suicides, and use different colors or patterns to distinguish
  between the years. Include labels and a legend to clearly differentiate between
  male and female populations. Omitting missing values, ensure data accuracy and take
  into account any significant trends or insights that could be derived from the visualization.
  Please also include a title and appropriate axis labels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  the years?

  2. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the title and axis labels?

  3. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers to highlight
  significant trends or insights on the chart?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart, such as the
  top, bottom, left, or right?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the bar width or spacing between the bars
  in the grouped bar chart?

  6. Is there a specific format you prefer for the axis labels, such as abbreviations
  or full text for age groups and years?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in which
  style (dotted, solid, etc.)?

  8. Are there any additional titles or subtitles you would like to include that provide
  context for the chart?

  9. Do you have any preference on how to handle overlapping labels or data points
  for clarity?

  10. Should the chart include any particular theme or design elements to align with
  your organizational branding or style?'
