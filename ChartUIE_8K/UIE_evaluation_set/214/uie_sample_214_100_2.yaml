initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trend of suicide numbers over
  the years, segmented by age group and sex, for different countries. Highlight key
  data points where the number of suicides spikes, and annotate these points to emphasize
  critical changes. The purpose of this visualization is to understand the temporal
  patterns and demographic variations in suicide rates. Additionally, use annotations
  to provide context, such as political or social changes that might correlate with
  significant trends. This will help in drawing attention to the most important aspects
  before diving into a deeper analysis of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the line
  chart, especially for representing different age groups and sexes?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to denote age groups, sexes, and countries
  distinctly?

  3. Do you prefer any specific format for the annotations on key data points (e.g.,
  arrows, text boxes)?

  4. How detailed should the annotations be for political or social changes that might
  correlate with the trends?

  5. Is there a particular style for chart lines (e.g., solid, dashed) you would like
  to use for different segments (age groups, sexes, countries)?

  6. What type of axis labels and titles would make the chart most effective for your
  audience?

  7. Do you prefer a particular layout or design for displaying segmented data by
  age group and sex (e.g., multi-line overlay, small multiples)?

  8. Would you like to include confidence intervals or error bands to represent data
  variability?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have any specific preferences.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend to denote age groups, sexes, and countries
  distinctly.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The annotations should be detailed enough to provide relevant context but not
  overly cluttered.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Clear and descriptive axis labels and titles that specify the years, number of
  suicides, and demographic categories would be helpful.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.
