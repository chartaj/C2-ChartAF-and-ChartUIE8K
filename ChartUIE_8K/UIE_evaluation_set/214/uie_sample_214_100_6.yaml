initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the WHO Suicide Statistics. The chart
  should show the distribution of suicide numbers across different age groups. Additionally,
  I would like to compare the data by sex, showcasing separate histograms for males
  and females within the same chart. Highlight any missing data points if possible.
  This will help to understand trends in suicides across various demographics over
  the years. Ensure the axes are clearly labeled and a legend is included for clarity.
  Can the age groups be color-coded for better visualization? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the age groups?

  2. Would you like the histograms to be overlaid or side-by-side for comparison by
  sex?

  3. Should any specific age groups or data points be highlighted?

  4. Is there a preferred order for displaying the age groups on the x-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the range or bin size of the histogram?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the legend placement on the chart?'
