initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart for the bakery sales dataset. Each column
  should represent a unique day part (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, etc.), and the columns
  should be stacked to show different items sold during these times. Use colors to
  distinguish between different items. Ensure the x-axis represents the different
  Dayparts and the y-axis represents the number of transactions. Additionally, differentiate
  between DayType (Weekday vs. Weekend) using different shades or patterns to provide
  more insight into sales distribution across week types. Please create this visualization
  accordingly. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to represent different
  items sold?

  2. Do you prefer specific shades or patterns to differentiate between Weekday and
  Weekend sales?

  3. Do you have any preference on the ordering of the Dayparts on the x-axis?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the y-axis for better readability of the number
  of transactions?

  5. Do you have any specific labels or titles you would prefer for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to clearly distinguish between different items
  sold and DayTypes?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and titles in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include data labels on the columns to display the exact number
  of transactions?'
