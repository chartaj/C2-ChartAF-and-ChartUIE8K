initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the Bakery Sales Dataset. Each
  point should represent a transaction, plotting 'DateTime' on the x-axis to indicate
  the time of purchase, and 'TransactionNo' on the y-axis to represent individual
  transactions. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between 'Daypart' (Morning,
  Afternoon, etc.) and 'DayType' (Weekend, Weekday). This will help in understanding
  the time patterns of bakery sales throughout the day and identifying peak times
  or trends relevant to different days. Make sure the scatter plot is clear and labels
  are readable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing ''Daypart''
  and ''DayType''?

  2. What size would you like the markers to be on the scatter plot?

  3. Should there be a legend to explain the colors or markers used? If so, where
  would you like it placed?

  4. Do you prefer specific time intervals (e.g., hourly, every 30 minutes) on the
  x-axis for ''DateTime''?

  5. How would you like the labels on the axes to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  6. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability? If so, should
  they be on both axes?

  7. Would you like any annotations or labels directly on specific points for emphasis?

  8. Should the scatter plot include a title? If yes, please specify the title.

  9. Do you need any particular background color for the plot area or figure?

  10. Are there any specific aspects you want to highlight or focus on in the chart?'
