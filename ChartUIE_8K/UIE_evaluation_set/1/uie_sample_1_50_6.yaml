initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the percentage contribution of Agriculture,
  Industry, and Services sectors to the GDP of various countries. Ensure the countries
  are listed along the y-axis and the sectors along the x-axis. Use varying colors
  to represent different percentage ranges for clear comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the heatmap''s color scheme (e.g., gradient
  scale, specific colors)?

  2. Would you like to set specific percentage ranges for color coding in the heatmap?

  3. Do you have a preferred ordering for the countries on the y-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by GDP size)?

  4. Should the heatmap include data labels for the percentage values within each
  cell?

  5. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color ranges in the heatmap?

  6. Are there any particular countries or sectors that you want to highlight or emphasize
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font and size for the text used in the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the heatmap for specific data
  points or ranges?'
