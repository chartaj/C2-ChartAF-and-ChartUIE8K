initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart comparing the Agriculture, Industry, and
  Services GDP contributions of the top 3 ranked countries (United States, China,
  Japan) for the year 2017. The axes should represent the percentage contributions

  of each country across different sectors.

  for each country on the radar chart?

  contributions for each sector?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the sectors on the axes (e.g., Agriculture,
  Industry, Services)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where do you prefer it to be placed
  (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  5. Do you want to highlight any particular sector or country in the chart?

  6. Would you like the radar chart to have gridlines or axis lines for better readability?

  7. Do you require any annotations or additional notes on the chart to explain certain
  data points?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
