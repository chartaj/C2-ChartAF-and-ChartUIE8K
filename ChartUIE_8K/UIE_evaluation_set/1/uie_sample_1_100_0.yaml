initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the GDP composition by sector
  for different countries. Use the following columns: Country/Economy, Agriculture
  GDP, Industry GDP, and Services GDP. Highlight top 3 ranks in each sector with different
  colors for clear distinction. Add text annotations to show the exact GDP values
  for these highlighted countries. The x-axis should represent different countries,
  and the y-axis should denote GDP values. This visualization will emphasize how each
  country''s economy is distributed across agriculture, industry, and services sectors,
  and highlight leading countries in each category.'
questions: '1. What color scheme would you like for the top 3 ranks in each sector?

  2. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  3. Would you like to include axis labels? If so, do you have specific labels in
  mind for the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines?

  6. Would you prefer a legend to explain the color coding for the top ranks?

  7. How would you like the data points for each sector to be represented (e.g., different
  shapes for Agriculture, Industry, and Services)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size of the markers in the scatter plot?

  9. Do you want any specific styling for the chart background (e.g., color, pattern)?

  10. Should the chart include any specific notes or annotations other than the GDP
  values for the top-ranked countries?'
