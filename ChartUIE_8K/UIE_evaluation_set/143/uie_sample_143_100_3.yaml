initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of the assumed_office
  years for U.S. 117th House of Representatives members. This will help us understand
  the range and central tendency of when members assumed office. Use the 'assumed_office'
  column to plot the data. Additionally, overlay data points for 'party' to differentiate
  between Republican and other parties, helping identify any potential patterns or
  outliers in the tenure start years among different parties. Including median and
  quartile ranges will provide more insight into the distribution of these starting
  years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  parties?

  2. Would you like to include a title and axis labels for the chart? If yes, could
  you specify them?

  3. Do you prefer the data points for ''party'' to be represented as different shapes
  or some other feature within the box plot?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different overlays for ''party''
  data points?

  5. Would you like to see the exact quartile ranges and median values as annotations
  on the chart?

  6. Is there any specific order you want for the different parties on the chart,
  such as Republicans first?

  7. Do you want the outliers to be specifically highlighted or just shown normally
  on the box plot?

  8. Are there any additional metrics or summaries you would like to see included
  in the visualization, such as mean or standard deviation?'
