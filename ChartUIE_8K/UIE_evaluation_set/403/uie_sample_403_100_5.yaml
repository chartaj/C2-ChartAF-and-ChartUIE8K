initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart to visualize the probability
  of rain by state. The data includes columns for 'code' (representing state codes)
  and 'prob' (indicating the probability of rain). Use the state codes (e.g., ME,
  RI, VT) on the x-axis and the probability values on the y-axis. Each state should
  have a unique color for its column. Label the x-axis with 'State Code' and the y-axis
  with 'Probability of Rain'. Include a legend to distinguish between the different
  probabilities. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for the\
  \ states?\n2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability?\n\
  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis titles have any specific font size or style?\n4.\
  \ Do you prefer the columns to have a specific width or spacing between them?\n\
  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or data labels on the columns?\n\
  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the states to be displayed (e.g.,\
  \ alphabetical, by probability value)?\n7. Do you want to add any specific title\
  \ to the chart itself? \n8. Would you prefer the legend to be placed at a specific\
  \ position (e.g., top, bottom, side)?"
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Alphabetical order by state code would be great.

  7. Please title the chart "Probability of Rain by State".

  8. I have no specific preference.'
