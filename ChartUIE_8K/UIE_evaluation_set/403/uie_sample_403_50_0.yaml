  3. Should the color intensity vary continuously with probability, or would you prefer
  discrete color bands?

  4. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations?

  5. Should the map include state borders for better distinction?

  6. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned on the
  map?
