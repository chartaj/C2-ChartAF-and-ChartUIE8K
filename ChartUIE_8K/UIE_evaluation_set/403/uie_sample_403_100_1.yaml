initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the probability of rain for different
  states using the provided dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the states
  with the highest and lowest probabilities of rain. Also, include non-data-driven
  annotations to indicate general weather trends. For example, you could note which
  states typically have higher chances of rain. Use highlights to make the selected
  states stand out by changing their dot sizes or colors. The purpose of this visualization
  is to clearly display and compare the likelihood of rain across various states for
  better weather forecasting and planning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the dot plot?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for the states with the highest and lowest
  probabilities to be displayed (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the overall size of the dots representing each
  state?

  4. Are there specific colors you would like to use to highlight the states with
  the highest and lowest probabilities of rain?

  5. How would you like the non-data-driven annotations to be styled (e.g., text color,
  font, location on the plot)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout and design of the chart (e.g.,
  background color, grid lines)?

  7. Are there any specific weather trends or additional information you would like
  to highlight in the non-data-driven annotations?

  8. Would you prefer any specific ordering of the states on the plot (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on probability values)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I would prefer the text annotations for the states with the highest and lowest
  probabilities to be in bold and in a contrasting color to the dots.

  3. I do not know, maybe medium-sized dots?

  4. I would like the states with the highest probability of rain to be highlighted
  in blue and the lowest in red.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the styling of non-data-driven annotations.

  6. I do not know.

  7. You could highlight which regions generally have higher chances of rain, perhaps
  mentioning the Pacific Northwest and Southeast for example.

  8. I would prefer the states to be ordered based on their probability values.'
