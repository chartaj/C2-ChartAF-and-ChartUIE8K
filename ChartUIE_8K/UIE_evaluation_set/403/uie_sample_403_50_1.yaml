initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the probability of rain by state code.
  Highlight higher probabilities and provide text annotations for states with extreme
  values. Focus the viewer's attention on the weather risk contrast across different
  states.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting higher
  probabilities?

  2. How would you like the extreme values to be annotated? (e.g., with state codes,
  probability percentages)

  3. Should the dot sizes vary by probability value, or remain uniform?

  4. Do you prefer any particular ordering for the states on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by probability)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color-coding or annotation?

  6. Is there a preferred background color or style that you would like the chart
  to have?

  7. Would you like any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you want to use for labels and annotations?

  9. Do you have a preferred position for the title and legend?

  10. Should grid lines be included on the chart for better readability? If yes, any
  specific style for them?'
