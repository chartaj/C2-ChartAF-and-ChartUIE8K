initial_prompt: Create a pie chart showing the probability of rain by region based
  on the provided weather data. Use "code" for region labels and "prob" for probabilities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Do you want the pie chart to display the percentage values explicitly?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each region on the slices?

  4. Would you like to have a legend indicating what each slice represents?

  5. Is there a specific radius or size you have in mind for the pie chart?

  6. Do you prefer the slices to be separated (exploded view) or close together?

  9. Is there a particular font style or size you want for the labels and titles?

  10. Do you want the regions to be sorted in a particular order (e.g., ascending,
  descending by probability)?'
