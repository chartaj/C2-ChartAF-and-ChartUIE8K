initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the gross sales over time, using
  the Publishing Year on the x-axis and gross sales on the y-axis. Highlight the area
  under the curve for genres that contributed the most sales, and use text annotations
  to display the notable data points such as highest gross sales and corresponding
  book names. This will help understand the sales trends for different years and highlight
  bestselling genres effectively. It should focus on arts and entertainment books,
  showing how sales and popularity have changed over the years.
