initial_prompt: I want to visualize the distribution of the number of books based
  on their average rating. Can you create a histogram showing "Book_average_rating"
  on the x-axis and the number of books on the y-axis? Include labels for clarity.
  This will help understand the spread and common ratings among books in the dataset.
  Make sure to include a title and proper axis labels so it's easy to understand.
  A little color differentiation would be nice to make it visually appealing and easily
  interpretable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred title for the histogram?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for the color differentiation?

  3. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and title?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a specific title.

  2. I do not have specific color preferences.

  3. I am not sure about the number of bins.

  4. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  5. I do not have specific preferences for fonts or font sizes.

  6. I do not know about any specific annotations or notes.


  Thank you!'
