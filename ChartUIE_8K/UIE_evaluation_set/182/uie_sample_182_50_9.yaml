initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between "Book_average_rating,"
  "Book_ratings_count," "gross sales," "publisher revenue," and "units sold" from
  the given dataset. This will help visualize relationships and dependencies among
  these variables.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display correlation values on the heatmap cells?

  3. How would you prefer to handle missing values, if any, in the data attributes?

  4. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would prefer for the heatmap?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to have a specific size or aspect ratio?

  6. Do you have a preference for the range of correlation values to be displayed
  (e.g., from -1 to 1)?

  7. Is there any specific annotation or additional information you would like to
  include in the heatmap?

  8. Would you prefer a particular order of variables in the heatmap, or should it
  be auto-arranged based on clustering?'
