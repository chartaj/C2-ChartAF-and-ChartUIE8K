initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the given dataset on book sales and ratings
  in the arts-and-entertainment category. The heatmap should display the correlation
  between different numerical features such as 'Book_average_rating', 'Book_ratings_count',
  'gross sales', 'publisher revenue', 'sale price', 'sales rank', and 'units sold'.
  Use a color gradient to depict the strength of the correlation, allowing easy identification
  of strong and weak relationships between these features. This will help in understanding
  patterns and insights related to how various factors affect book sales and ratings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a specific color palette in mind (e.g., blue-to-red, green-to-yellow)?

  3. Should the heatmap display numerical values directly on the cells?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout or size for the heatmap?

  5. Should there be any labeling or annotations on specific correlations of interest?

  6. Do you have preferences regarding the heatmap''s axis labels and title?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines or borders within the heatmap cells?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you would like to highlight within
  the heatmap?

  9. Should the color gradient be linear or logarithmic?'
