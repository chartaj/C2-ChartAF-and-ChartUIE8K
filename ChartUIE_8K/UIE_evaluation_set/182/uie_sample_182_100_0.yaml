initial_prompt: '<start of user instruction>

  Create a Pie chart visualizing the distribution of book genres. Highlight the genres
  with the highest and lowest gross sales to emphasize their significance. Add data-driven
  text annotations to show the actual gross sales values for these highlighted genres.
  The purpose is to understand the financial impact of different genres in the book
  market. This visualization should help identify which genres are the most and least
  profitable based on gross sales. Use the dataset''s genre and gross sales columns
  to generate this chart. Make sure the annotations are clear and stand out.
