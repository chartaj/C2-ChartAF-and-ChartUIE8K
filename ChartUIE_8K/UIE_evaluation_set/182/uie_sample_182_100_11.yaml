initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  'Publishing Year' and 'Book_average_rating' from the dataset. Each point on the
  scatter plot should represent a book, with 'Publishing Year' on the x-axis and 'Book_average_rating'
  on the y-axis. Additionally, use different colors or shapes to represent unique
  'genre' categories to show how book genres are distributed over different publishing
  years and their average ratings. This will help in understanding trends and preferences
  in book ratings over the years across various genres. Ensure the plot includes labels
  for both axes and a legend for the genres.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to represent
  different genres?

  2. Would you prefer specific shapes for different genres, or should we use default
  shapes?

  3. Is there a particular title you would like for the scatter plot?

  4. Do you have specific size preferences for the data points on the scatter plot?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or highlight features you would like on the
  scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?
  If so, in both axes or just one?

  7. Should there be any specific range set for either the ''Publishing Year'' or
  ''Book_average_rating'' axes, or should it auto-scale to fit the data?

  8. Would you like the legend for genres to be placed in a specific location on the
  plot (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  9. Are there any additional text labels or customizations you would like to include
  on the axes (e.g., fonts, sizes)?

  10. Would you like trend lines added to the scatter plot to show the overall trend
  more clearly?'
