initial_prompt: Create a Donut chart visualizing the proportion of different genres
  in the dataset. Use the 'genre' column for categorization and the 'units sold' column
  for the data values. This will help identify the most popular genres based on units
  sold.

  sold?

  4. Should we include a legend alongside the Donut chart?

  popular to least popular)?

  6. Do you want the chart title to be customized, and if so, what would you like
  it to be?

  information?

  8. Are there any specific font preferences for the text used in the chart?'
