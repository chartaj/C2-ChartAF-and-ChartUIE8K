initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total gross sales and
  publisher revenue for each book. The x-axis should represent each book name, and
  the y-axis should show the amount in currency. Different segments of the bars should
  represent gross sales and publisher revenue, stacked on top of each other. This
  will help compare the financial performance between the books. Use different colors
  to distinguish between gross sales and publisher revenue within each stacked bar.
  This will provide a clear visual representation of the overall earnings for each
  book.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  gross sales and publisher revenue?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be ordered by any specific criteria (e.g., alphabetical
  order of book names, descending order of total gross sales)?

  3. Do you want to include labels showing the exact values for gross sales and publisher
  revenue on each bar segment?

  4. Would you like to add any specific annotations or highlights to the chart (e.g.,
  indicating highest or lowest performing books)?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you require a legend to be displayed, and if so, do you have a preference
  for its position on the chart?

  7. Should the y-axis be a linear scale, or would you prefer a logarithmic scale
  if the ranges of sales are significantly large?

  8. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart for better readability of the values?'
