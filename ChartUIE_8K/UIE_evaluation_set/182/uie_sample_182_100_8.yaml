initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the relationship between 'Publishing
  Year', 'Book_average_rating', and 'units sold' for books in the given dataset. The
  x-axis should represent the 'Publishing Year', the y-axis should represent 'Book_average_rating',
  and the size of the bubbles should represent 'units sold'. This will help in understanding
  how the ratings and sales of books have varied over the years. Use different colors
  to distinguish between various authors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for distinguishing
  between authors?

  2. Would you prefer any specific data point annotations or labels on the chart?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify the colors representing different
  authors?

  4. Do you have a preferred range or scale for the x-axis (Publishing Year) and y-axis
  (Book_average_rating)?

  5. Would you like gridlines or a specific background style for the chart?

  6. Should the chart title or axis labels follow any particular formatting or font
  preferences?

  7. Do you want to include a trend line or any other statistical indicators on the
  chart?

  8. Would you like to set a minimum or maximum bubble size for better readability?

  9. Is there a specific order or arrangement you would prefer for displaying the
  authors in the legend?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the spacing or padding within the chart?'
