initial_prompt: Create a column chart visualizing the mean values of the radius, texture,
  and perimeter for each diagnosis category (M and B). Include annotations to highlight
  the highest values in each category. This helps in understanding how these features
  differ between malignant and benign tumors in breast cancer diagnosis.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns representing\
  \ 'M' (malignant) and 'B' (benign) diagnosis categories?\n2. Are there particular\
  \ fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations highlighting the highest values?\n\
  3. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?\n4.\
  \ Do you have a preferred style for the annotations (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?\n\
  5. Do you need a legend included in the chart, or is it unnecessary in this context?\n\
  6. Should the y-axis include a range starting from zero or should it be adjusted\
  \ to fit the data range more tightly?\n7. Would you like labels to be displayed\
  \ directly on each column indicating the mean values?\n8. Do you prefer a specific\
  \ orientation for the x-axis labels (horizontal, vertical, or angled)?\n9. Are there\
  \ any specific titles or subtitles you wish to include in the chart? \n10. Is there\
  \ a preference for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g., modern, classic,\
  \ minimalistic)?"
