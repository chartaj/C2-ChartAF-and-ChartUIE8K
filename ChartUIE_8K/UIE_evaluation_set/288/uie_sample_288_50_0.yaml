initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'radius_mean',
  'texture_mean', and 'area_mean' for different 'diagnosis' categories. Highlight
  outliers and annotate significant deviations. The purpose is to identify variations
  and potential patterns for further analysis in breast cancer diagnosis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different ''diagnosis''
  categories in the box chart?
