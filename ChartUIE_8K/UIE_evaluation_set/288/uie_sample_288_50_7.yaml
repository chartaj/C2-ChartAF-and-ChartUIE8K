initial_prompt: Please create a histogram of the "radius_mean" column from the Breast
  Cancer Dataset. Display the distribution of radius values for both malignant and
  benign tumors. This should help visualize how radius size varies between different
  diagnoses. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  between malignant and benign tumors?

  2. Would you like the histogram to include a legend indicating the categories?

  3. What bin size would you prefer for the histogram?

  4. Should the histogram be normalized to show relative frequencies instead of raw
  counts?

  5. Do you want any specific labels or titles for the axes and chart?

  6. Do you want grid lines in the background of the histogram to enhance readability?

  7. Do you have any preference for the overall style or theme (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, classic) of the histogram?

  8. Would you like to include any statistical measures (e.g., mean, median) on the
  histogram?

  9. Should the histogram have any additional annotations or markers for specific
  data points of interest?

  10. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would prefer for text within
  the chart?'
