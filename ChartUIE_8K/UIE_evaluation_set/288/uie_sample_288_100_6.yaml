initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the data from the Breast Cancer Dataset
  [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. Specifically, I want to compare the 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean',
  and 'perimeter_mean' for the first three entries, using different lines for each
  metric. The x-axis should represent the 'id' values, and the y-axis should represent
  the corresponding metric values. Additionally, color-code each line for better visibility.
  This visual should help in understanding the comparative differences for these parameters
  among the initial cases. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors for the different
  lines representing ''radius_mean'', ''texture_mean'', and ''perimeter_mean''?

  2. Would you like to include any markers on the lines to represent specific data
  points?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines?

  5. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like to include for the chart,
  axes, or legend?

  6. Would you like to display the values of the data points directly on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Should the chart have a legend, and if so, where would you like the legend to
  be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  9. Is there any additional information or annotations you would like to add to the
  chart for context?'
