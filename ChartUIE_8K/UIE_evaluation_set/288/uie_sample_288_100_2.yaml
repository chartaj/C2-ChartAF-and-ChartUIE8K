initial_prompt: I want a column chart visualizing the 'radius_mean' and 'texture_mean'
  from the Breast Cancer Dataset for each diagnosis type (M and B). Highlight specific
  data points for easy comparison. Include text annotations to show the exact mean
  values for 'radius_mean' and 'texture_mean' for some selected points, especially
  those that seem significant. Use shape annotations, such as rectangles or arrows,
  to emphasize any noticeable trends or outliers in the data. This visualization aims
  to help understand the differences in these measurements between the two diagnosis
  types.
questions: '- Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the ''M'' and
  ''B'' diagnosis types?

  - Are there specific thresholds or criteria you want to use for identifying significant
  data points?

  - How would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed, such as font size or
  style?

  - Do you have a preference for the shapes used to emphasize trends or outliers (e.g.,
  specific shapes or colors for rectangles and arrows)?

  - Would you like the bars in the column chart to be grouped or stacked for each
  diagnosis type?

  - Is there a specific order you prefer for categorizing the data, such as sorting
  by mean values or diagnosis type?

  - How detailed do you want the axis labels to be (e.g., decimal places for mean
  values)?

  - Are there any specific labels or legends you want included in the chart?

  - Would you like any additional context or explanations included in the chart to
  aid interpretation?'
