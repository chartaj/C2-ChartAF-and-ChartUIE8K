initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to breast cancer diagnostics (Wisconsin Diagnostic
  UCI). I need a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between the radius_mean
  and texture_mean for the different diagnosis categories (M for malignant and B for
  benign). Please use color coding to differentiate between the diagnosis categories.
  The plot should help in visualizing any possible clustering or trends in the data
  that could be useful for distinguishing between malignant and benign cases. Please
  ensure that the axes are properly labeled and the plot has a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  between the ''malignant'' and ''benign'' categories?

  2. Are there specific markers or shapes you prefer to use for the scatter plot points?

  3. Would you like a specific title for the scatter plot?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font size or style for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Is there a specific orientation or layout you prefer for the legend (e.g., top,
  right, bottom)?

  6. Do you want any grid lines in the background of the scatter plot?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the x-axis (''radius_mean'')
  and y-axis (''texture_mean'')?

  8. Would you like to include any trend lines or regression lines in the scatter
  plot?

  9. Do you prefer a particular format for the plot labels (e.g., bold, italic)?

  10. Do you need any additional annotations or notes on the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about specific markers or shapes.

  3. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  4. I do not know about font size or style preferences.

  5. I prefer the legend to be on the right.

  6. Yes, I would like grid lines in the background.

  7. I do not have specific ranges or scales in mind.

  8. No, I do not want any trend lines or regression lines included.

  9. I do not have a preference for plot label format.

  10. No additional annotations or notes are needed.'
