initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of the 'diagnosis'
  column in the Breast Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. The chart should
  show the percentage of 'M' (Malignant) and 'B' (Benign) diagnoses. Ensure that each
  section is clearly labeled with both the category and the percentage value. Use
  different colors for each category to enhance readability. This pie chart will help
  in understanding the proportion of malignant to benign cases in the dataset, providing
  a quick visual insight into the overall dataset composition. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used for the ''Malignant''
  and ''Benign'' sections of the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to specify a particular font or font size for the labels?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., positioned to the right,
  bottom, etc.)?

  4. Should the chart include a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  5. Do you prefer any specific style for the chart (e.g., 3D effect, flat design)?

  6. Is there a specific way you want the percentage values formatted (e.g., decimal
  places)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional notes or annotations on the chart?'
