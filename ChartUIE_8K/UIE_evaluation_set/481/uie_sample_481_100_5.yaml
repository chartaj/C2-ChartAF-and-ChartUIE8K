initial_prompt: Create a heatmap displaying the average per capita supply of calories
  in various countries. Use the countries (Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy,
  United States, Hong Kong, Australia) as the x-axis and the types of nutrients supplied
  (calories from fat, carbohydrates, and animal protein) as the y-axis. The heatmap
  should visually represent the values from the dataset, showing how each country
  compares in terms of nutrient supply. This will aid in health and nutrition analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for color schemes in the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer a specific gradient scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  3. Would you like to include data labels within the heatmap cells?

  4. Do you prefer to have country names on the x-axis or abbreviations?

  5. Do you want grid lines to separate each cell explicitly?

  6. Should we include legends for clarity on the nutrient types and values?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for axis labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to highlight specific countries or nutrient types?

  9. Is there a specific range for the color scale that you want to set (e.g., minimum
  and maximum values)?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the heatmap for context?'
