initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization using the provided dataset on the average
  per capita supply of calories. Each entity (country) should be a block, sized and
  colored based on their values in Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy, United
  States, Hong Kong, and Australia columns. The blocks should reflect the calorie
  supply data (measured values) for the given entities. Use different shades to depict
  varying amounts of calories, fats, carbohydrates, and animal protein supplies. Ensure
  the chart distinctly shows the hierarchy and distribution comparison of the nutritional
  supply among the countries listed. Include a legend to explain the color shading.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the different
  shades depicting calories, fats, carbohydrates, and animal protein supplies?

  3. Should the legend include numerical ranges or descriptive labels for color shading?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style and size for the labels
  within the Treemap?

  5. Are there specific formatting preferences for the blocks, such as borders or
  padding between them?

  6. How detailed should the hierarchical structure within the Treemap be?

  7. Do you require any tooltips or labels to appear when users hover over the blocks?

  8. Should the chart title and axis labels follow any specific formatting guidelines?

  9. Do you have a preferred width-to-height ratio for the Treemap?

  10. Are there any specific branding guidelines or visual styles we need to adhere
  to in the visualization?'
