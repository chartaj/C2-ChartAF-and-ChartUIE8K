initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  'Capture' and 'Weighting' for different fish species. Make sure to differentiate
  the points by coloring them according to the 'Gephart Category.' Add another dimension
  by varying the size of the points based on the 'Total by Group' values. Label the
  axes appropriately, and include a legend to indicate the categories. This plot will
  help in understanding how capture quantities relate to the given weighting by fish
  type and category.
