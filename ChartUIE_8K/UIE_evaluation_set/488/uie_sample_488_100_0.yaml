initial_prompt: Create a box chart comparing the Weighting of different species of
  fish across various categories. Use diverse color highlights for distinct categories
  such as Gephart Category to visualize distributions effectively. Specifically annotate
  key values or outliers in the chart to emphasize notable data points, which helps
  focus attention on important differences in fish weightings. The chartâ€™s objective
  is to analyze and compare fish weightings across categories for fisheries management
  and zoological research. This visualization will help identify significant variations
  and trends in fish species' weightings for better decision-making in the field.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the distinct categories?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be marked or highlighted on the chart?

  3. Would you prefer any particular style or design for the annotations of key values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the axis labels, title, or legend format?

  5. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would like the chart to be?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart?

  7. Should the chart include detailed tooltips or hover information for each data
  point?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  9. Do you have a preferred ordering for the categories (e.g., by weight, alphabetical)?

  10. Would you like to include a summary or footnote explaining the notable findings
  of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like clear and descriptive axis labels and a concise title. Legend format
  should be clear and informative.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines in the background.

  7. I do not need detailed tooltips since it is an image, not an interactive visualization.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I do not have a preferred ordering for the categories.

  10. Yes, a summary or footnote explaining the notable findings would be helpful.'
