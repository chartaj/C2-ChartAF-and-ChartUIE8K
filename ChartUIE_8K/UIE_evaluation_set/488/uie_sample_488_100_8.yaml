initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the average capture amount for different
  fish species grouped by Gephart Category. Use the 'Species' for the x-axis and 'Capture'
  for the y-axis. Group the bars by 'Gephart Category' to show comparisons. Color-code
  the bars by different Gephart Categories. Ensure the chart has a legend to indicate
  which colors represent each Gephart Category. Include axis labels and a title "Average
  Capture Amount by Species and Gephart Category". Also, fill in any missing data
  points if possible, and ensure that all data is accurately represented. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme to be used for
  different Gephart Categories?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or gridlines?

  4. Would you like any specific annotation or data labels on the bars?

  5. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the fish species on the x-axis (alphabetical,
  by capture amount, etc.)?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions (width x height) you would prefer for the chart?

  7. Would you like to display any additional statistical data (e.g., error bars,
  standard deviation) along with the average capture amounts?

  8. How would you like missing data points to be handled in the chart (e.g., leave
  blank, use average of available data, etc.)?'
