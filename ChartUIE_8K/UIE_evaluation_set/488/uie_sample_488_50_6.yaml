initial_prompt: I'd like a grouped bar chart showing 'Species' on the x-axis and 'Capture',
  'Total by Group', and 'Weighting' as the grouped bars for each species, representing
  their values. This will help visualize the capture data and weighting for each fish
  species.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show the exact values?

  3. Do you prefer having a legend, or should the categories be differentiated solely
  by color?

  4. What level of detail do you want in the axis labels (e.g., full species names,
  abbreviations)?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better value estimation, or would you
  prefer a cleaner look?

  6. Is there a specific order you''d like the species to be sorted in (e.g., alphabetically,
  by value)?

  7. Do you need any additional annotations or reference lines on the chart?

  8. Would you like to include axis titles or any descriptive text on the chart?'
