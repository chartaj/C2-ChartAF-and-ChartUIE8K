initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the weighting of different fish species
  against their capture amounts. Use columns 'Species', 'Capture', and 'Weighting'
  from the provided dataset. Highlight the variability in fish catches and correlate
  it with their respective weightings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different species?

  2. Would you like data points to be labeled with species names or remain as points
  only?

  3. Should the axes have specific ranges or scales (e.g., logarithmic)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style or size for data points (e.g. circles, squares,
  varying sizes based on value)?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  6. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?

  7. Do you require trend lines or regression lines to be shown on the scatter plot?'
