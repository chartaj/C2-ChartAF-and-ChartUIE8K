initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart using the provided data from '488.csv'.
  The chart should visualize the 'Gephart Category' distribution among the captured
  species. The inner part of the donut should show the 'LCA_Category' breakdown, which
  will give a more detailed view of the fish categories. Use different colors to distinguish
  between the categories clearly. Make sure that the percentage of each section is
  visible for better interpretation. Title the chart as "Distribution of Fish Capture
  by Gephart Category and LCA Category." This visualization will help in understanding
  the fish weighting across different categories.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the categories?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the chart title and percentage
  labels?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned?

  4. Should the chart include labels for each category inside the donut sections,
  or only percentages?

  5. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the donut sections?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or descriptions outside
  the general title and labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Only percentages.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. No, just the general title and labels are fine.'
