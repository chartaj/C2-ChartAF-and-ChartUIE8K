initial_prompt: Create a population pyramid using the Women Fashion Trend Dataset
  to visualize the units sold by product variation size ('product_variation_size_id').
  Highlight sizes with the highest sales in a distinct color. Annotate top-selling
  items to show specific units sold, retail price, and rating. This will help identify
  which sizes are most popular and their correlating performance metrics. The visualization
  should focus viewer attention on sales distribution among sizes and the associated
  product ratings to provide insightful trends. Include a key to distinguish highlighted
  sizes for clarity.

  with the highest sales?
