initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the product colors in the "Women Fashion
  Trend Dataset". Show the distribution of different colors among the products. Use
  the "product_color" column to extract the color data and represent each unique color
  as a slice of the pie. Make sure the chart is labeled clearly with each color name
  and its corresponding percentage. This will help me understand which colors are
  most popular in women's fashion on this platform.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Should the pie chart include a legend, or would you prefer all labels directly
  on the slices?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for the labels?

  4. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Should the slices be ordered in any particular way, such as by size or alphabetically
  by color?

  6. Do you prefer a traditional circular pie chart or a variation, such as a donut
  chart?

  7. Would you like to highlight or emphasize any specific color slices? If yes, please
  specify.

  8. Do you want to display the exact product counts in addition to percentages on
  the chart?'
