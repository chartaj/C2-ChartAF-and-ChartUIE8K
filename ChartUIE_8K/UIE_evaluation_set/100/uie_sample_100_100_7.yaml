initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between units sold
  and product rating for various women fashion items. Each dot should represent a
  unique product. The x-axis should indicate the units sold, while the y-axis represents
  the product rating. Use different colors for dots based on the theme (e.g., summer,
  winter). Ensure the plot is clear, with labeled axes and a legend for the themes.
  This will help in understanding trends between popularity (units sold) and customer
  satisfaction (rating) for women fashion items in the dataset.

  summer, winter)?

  2. Do you have a specific title in mind for the dot plot?

  4. Do you want any grid lines included in the background for better readability?

  dots themselves?

  9. Would you like to display the exact values of units sold and product ratings

  this dot plot?'
