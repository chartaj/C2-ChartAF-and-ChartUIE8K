initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization using the Women Fashion Trend Dataset.
  The main categories should be the merchant_name, and within each merchant, break
  down the units_sold by product_color. The size of each rectangle should represent
  the units_sold, and the color should represent the average rating. This will help
  understand which merchants have higher sales and how different colors perform in
  terms of sales and ratings within each merchant. Make sure to include clear labels
  for each section and a legend for the color scale based on rating.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color scale representing
  the average rating?

  2. Would you like the Treemap to be sorted in any particular order, such as by units
  sold or by merchant rating?

  3. How would you like the labels to be displayed on each section of the Treemap
  (e.g., showing both merchant name and product color)?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the legend for the color scale be positioned at a specific location in
  the chart?

  6. Would you prefer to highlight any particular merchants or product colors within
  the Treemap?'
