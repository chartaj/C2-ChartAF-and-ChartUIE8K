initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of units sold
  per product color for different shipping options. The x-axis should represent the
  product colors, and the y-axis should represent the number of units sold. Each bar
  will be divided into segments representing different shipping options such as 'Livraison
  standard'. Use different colors to differentiate between shipping options. Title
  the chart "Units Sold by Product Color and Shipping Option" and include a legend
  to indicate the shipping options. This will help visualize the relationship between
  product color popularity and preferred shipping methods.

  options?
