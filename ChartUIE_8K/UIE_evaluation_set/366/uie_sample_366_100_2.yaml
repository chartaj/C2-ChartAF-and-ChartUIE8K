  reviews for the top 3 courses in the Business Finance subject. Use the course titles
  as the labels on the x-axis, and two stacked segments representing subscribers and
  reviews on the y-axis. The chart should help visualize the engagement levels (subscribers
  vs. reviews) for these specific courses.

  representing subscribers and reviews?

  of subscribers or reviews)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the axis labels
  and titles?

  7. Do you want the chart title to reflect anything specific other than "Engagement
  Levels for Top 3 Business Finance Courses"?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be shown or hidden on the chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the chart''s aspect ratio (e.g., square, wide, or
  tall)?
