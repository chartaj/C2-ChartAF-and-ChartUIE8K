initial_prompt: I need a Treemap chart for Udemy courses from the provided data. It
  should show subjects and break them down by course levels. Each rectangle should
  represent a course. The size of each rectangle should correspond to the number of
  subscribers, and the color should reflect the price range. This way, we can easily
  understand which subjects are popular and how course levels differ within subjects.
  Additionally, include course titles as labels if possible for better clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme representing
  different price ranges?

  2. Is there a particular way you would like the course levels to be visually distinguished
  within each subject?

  3. How would you like the course titles to be displayed within the rectangles? Should
  they appear only on hover, or always be visible?

  4. Do you have any preferred font size or style for the course titles and labels?

  5. Are there any specific subjects or course levels you would like to emphasize
  or highlight?

  6. Is there a minimum or maximum value for the price or number of subscribers that
  you would like to filter or exclude?

  7. Is it important to include a legend or key for interpreting the size and color
  of rectangles? If so, do you have any preferences for its placement?'

  2. I am not sure how to visually distinguish the course levels; I trust your expertise.
