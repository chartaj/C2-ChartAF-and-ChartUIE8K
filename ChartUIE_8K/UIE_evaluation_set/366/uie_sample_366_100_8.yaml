initial_prompt: I need a line chart for Udemy Courses showing the relationship between
  the number of subscribers and the number of reviews across different courses listed
  in the dataset. The x-axis should represent the course titles and the y-axis should
  have two lines, one for the number of subscribers and another for the number of
  reviews. This will help visualize the popularity and feedback of the courses. Please
  ensure that the chart is clear and readable with distinct colors for the two lines.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the two lines representing
  the number of subscribers and number of reviews?

  2. How would you like the course titles to be displayed on the x-axis? Horizontally
  or rotated for better readability?

  3. Would you prefer gridlines in the background to enhance readability or would
  you prefer a cleaner look without them?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and titles?

  5. Do you want the legend to be located at a specific place on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the y-axis?

  7. Do you have any specific design preferences for the line style (solid, dashed,
  dotted)?

  8. Would you like data points to be marked with symbols on the lines for subscribers
  and reviews?

  9. Do you want each course title to be fully displayed or would it be acceptable
  to truncate long titles with ellipsis?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you would like to be added
  to the chart to emphasize certain data points?'
