initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of car prices from
  the sample data. Since the dataset deals with supply chain management for cars,
  we want to analyze how car prices vary across different models and makers. Use the
  "CarPrice" column to create the histogram, and make sure to label the axes clearly.
  Additionally, please color-code the histogram bars based on different car makers
  from the "CarMaker" column to provide more insight into which manufacturers have
  the highest and lowest price ranges.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram bars?

  2. What bin size would you prefer for the histogram?

  3. How would you like the different car makers to be represented in the color coding
  (e.g., specific colors for specific makers)?

  4. Would you like the histogram to display frequency or density on the y-axis?

  5. Is there a specific range of car prices you want to focus on in the histogram?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  8. Do you prefer to have data labels on the bars to show the exact count or percentage?

  9. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you want to include in the
  chart?'
