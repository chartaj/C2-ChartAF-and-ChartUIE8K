initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the total sales by Car Maker. Highlight
  the bar with the highest sales in green. Add a trend line to show sales patterns
  over time. Include annotations that show data shapes and highlights, such as the
  number of unique Car Makers and Customer Feedback distribution.
questions: '1. What color preferences do you have for the bars, aside from the highest
  sales being highlighted in green?

  2. How would you like the trend line to be styled (e.g., color, thickness, dashed
  or solid line)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for annotations and labels?

  4. Should the labels of the Car Makers be displayed in any specific orientation
  (e.g., vertical, horizontal, angled)?

  5. Would you prefer a specific ordering for the Car Makers in the bar chart (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by sales volume)?

  6. Are there specific thresholds or ranges for Customer Feedback distribution that
  you would like to highlight or annotate?

  7. Any preference for the background color or gridlines of the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have any specific preferences
  for its placement and style?

  9. Do you want to display the exact sales figures on the bars, or would you prefer
  a simpler presentation?'
