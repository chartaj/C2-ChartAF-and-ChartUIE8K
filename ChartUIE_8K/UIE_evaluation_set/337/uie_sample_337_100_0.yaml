initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the sales performance of different
  car models supplied by various suppliers over the years. Highlight the top-performing
  models with distinct colors to emphasize their superiority. Use shapes like rectangles
  to enclose underperforming models and emphasize comparison. Include annotations
  describing the importance of each highlighted model. Additionally, display the sales
  trends over the car model years as trend lines to show data-driven insights. This
  will help in understanding which car models are gaining or losing popularity through
  the years, aiding strategic decision-making in supply chain management for cars.
