initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between CarPrice
  and Sales for different CarMakers in the supply chain management data. Use CarMaker
  as the color-coded category. The x-axis should represent the CarPrice, and the y-axis
  should represent Sales. Additionally, use ShipMode for the shape of the points to
  see how different shipping methods impact sales versus car prices. Please include
  a legend to identify colors and shapes corresponding to CarMakers and ShipModes
  respectively. Ensure that the chart is clear and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for the CarMakers categories?

  2. Do you have any specific shapes in mind to represent different ShipModes?

  3. Would you like to include data point annotations or labels for any specific details?

  4. Are there specific ranges or limits for CarPrice and Sales that you want to be
  highlighted or filtered in the scatter plot?

  5. Would you prefer to use grid lines to enhance readability? If so, in what color
  or style?

  6. Do you have preferences for font styles or sizes for the chart titles, axis labels,
  or legend?

  7. Is there a particular format or style you want for the legend (e.g., position,
  layout)?

  8. Would you like to include additional reference lines such as average lines for
  CarPrice or Sales?

  9. Are there any specific details that should be highlighted or called out within
  the scatter plot?'
