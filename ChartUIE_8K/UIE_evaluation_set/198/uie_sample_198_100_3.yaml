initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of emotions
  in the given dataset. The dataset consists of comments and their corresponding emotions
  - fear, anger, and one other emotion. The x-axis should represent the unique emotions,
  and the y-axis should represent the count of comments for each emotion. This chart
  should help in understanding the most frequent emotions present in the dataset and
  should be easy to interpret for a psychology analysis context. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  emotions?

  2. Do you want the bar labels to display exact counts of comments?

  3. Is there a particular order you would like the emotions to be displayed on the
  x-axis? (e.g., alphabetical, descending count)

  4. What level of detail do you prefer for the y-axis labels? (e.g., increments of
  10, 50)

  5. Do you have a preference for the title of the bar chart?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to specify which colors correspond to which
  emotions, or should it be embedded in the bar labels?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines in the background to help in reading values, or would
  you like a cleaner look without gridlines?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you prefer for the labels and title?

  9. Do you want to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart for context?'
