initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the dataset that visualizes the emotions
  expressed in comments related to psychology. I want to see each comment represented
  as a point in the plot, with the x-axis showing a numerical index of the comment
  and the y-axis indicating the type of emotion ('fear', 'anger', etc.). Different
  colors should be used to represent each unique emotion to distinguish them clearly.
  This will help me understand the distribution and frequency of different emotions
  within the dataset. Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each unique emotion?

  2. Would you like a title for the scatter plot? If so, please provide the desired
  title.

  3. Should there be labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If yes, what would you like
  them to be?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which color represents each emotion?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the plot for better readability? If yes, should they
  be on both axes or one specific axis?

  7. Is there any specific range or scale for the x-axis or y-axis that you want to
  set?

  8. Would you like any annotations or markers for specific data points or categories
  on the scatter plot?'
