initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize how the emotions in the dataset vary within
  the comments. Specifically, I'd love a box chart that shows the distribution of
  comments for each emotion type (fear, anger, etc.). This will help me to understand
  the spread and central tendency of these emotions. Since this dataset relates to
  psychology and emotions, it would be insightful to see if certain emotions have
  a wider range or if they cluster around particular sentiment scores. Could you please
  create that for me?
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box chart?

  2. Do you prefer any particular order for the display of emotion types (e.g., alphabetical,
  by frequency)?

  3. Would you like to include any labels or annotations on the box chart (e.g., median
  values, quartiles)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Would you like to see any additional statistics on the chart (e.g., mean, standard
  deviation)?

  6. Are there any specific emotions you want to highlight or differentiate in the
  chart?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style for the box plots (traditional, notched, etc.)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend on the chart?

  9. Do you have any size or aspect ratio preferences for the chart?

  10. Do you prefer the use of specific fonts or font sizes for the chart text?'

  2. I am not sure, maybe alphabetical?

  3. Yes, please include median values.

  4. I do not know.

  6. No, I do not have any specific emotions to highlight.

  7. Traditional style is fine.
