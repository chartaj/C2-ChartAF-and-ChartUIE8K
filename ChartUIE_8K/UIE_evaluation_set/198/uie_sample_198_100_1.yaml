initial_prompt: Visualize the Emotion Dataset using a treemap chart. Color-code each
  "Emotion" to easily distinguish between them. Make sure to highlight sections with
  the most unique "Comment" entries to emphasize their significance. Use text annotations
  to display the count of each emotion category within their respective sections.
  The chart should help identify which emotions are more prevalent and provide context
  on their distribution. Enable users to focus on highlighted areas for insights into
  common emotional themes. Ensure the layout clearly represents the psychology context
  of the data.

  chart layout?'
