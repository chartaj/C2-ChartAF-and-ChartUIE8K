initial_prompt: Please create a box chart for the dataset in '../Extra_datas/data/123.csv'.
  I want the box chart to show the distribution of 'Price' across different 'Color'
  categories. This will help us understand how the prices vary based on different
  colors in the given time periods. Additionally, make sure to highlight any outliers
  that might be present in the data. This visualization will be useful for our arts-and-entertainment
  project, Win-Go, focused on color prediction trends. Data accuracy is crucial, so
  ensure the chart reflects all price ranges accurately.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to represent different
  ''Color'' categories?

  2. Should the box chart include a title? If so, do you have a specific title in
  mind?

  3. Do you prefer specific labels for the x-axis and y-axis, or should they default
  to ''Color'' and ''Price'' respectively?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style and size of the fonts used in the chart?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the box chart for better readability of
  the data?

  6. Do you want the whiskers of the box chart to represent specific percentiles (e.g.,
  5th and 95th) or follow the default settings?

  7. Are there any specific methods you prefer for identifying and highlighting outliers?

  8. Should the chart include a legend for the categories, even though the x-axis
  represents the ''Color'' categories?

  9. Do you have a preference for the overall size and aspect ratio of the chart?

  10. Is there any additional annotation or information that you want to be included
  in the chart?'
