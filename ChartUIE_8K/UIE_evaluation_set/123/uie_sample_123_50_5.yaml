initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the variation of 'Price' over 'Period'
  from the data file. Group data by 'Color' to show separate lines for each color.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different lines representing
  each color category?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  4. Would you like to highlight any specific time periods on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific type of line style (e.g., dashed, solid) for the different
  lines?

  6. Should we include data points on the lines themselves, or would you prefer a
  smooth line without points?

  7. Is there a particular font style and size you prefer for the axes labels and
  title?

  8. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should it be placed (e.g.,
  top-right, bottom-left)?

  9. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the lines?

  10. Should the y-axis be adjusted to a specific range, or should it automatically
  scale based on the data?'
