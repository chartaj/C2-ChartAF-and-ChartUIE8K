initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the 'Price' across different
  'Period' values mentioned in the dataset. Make sure to include 'Color' as a grouped
  category within each 'Period'. This is an important aspect for us because it helps
  in visualizing how 'Price' varies not only over time but also with respect to different
  'Color' categories. Ensure labels are clear and legends specify the 'Color' categories
  accurately. This will be used in our arts-and-entertainment dashboard for better
  visual insight. Focus on Period, Price, and Color attributes only.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or themes for the grouped
  bar chart to match the arts-and-entertainment dashboard?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or data labels directly on
  the bars to emphasize certain values?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels,
  titles, or legends?

  4. Is there a preferred order for displaying the ''Period'' values on the x-axis?

  5. Should the ''Color'' categories be displayed in any specific sequence within
  each ''Period'' group?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the width or spacing of the bars within
  each group?

  7. Would you prefer a specific chart title or subtitle to be included?

  8. Are there any gridline preferences for the chart background to enhance readability?

  9. Do you want to display the ''Price'' values on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  10. Are there any specific legend placement preferences (e.g., top, bottom, side)
  for clarity?'
