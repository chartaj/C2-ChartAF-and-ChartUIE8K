initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'Price' column
  from this dataset. The data relates to color prediction within the arts and entertainment
  context. Please use the 'Period' column for the x-axis, plotting different price
  values over time. The y-axis should represent the frequency of the prices. Also,
  utilize different colors to categorize and highlight the 'Color' data within this
  histogram, making it easier to identify the frequency of each price range for different
  colors. Make sure to include a legend to differentiate the colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different ''Color'' categories
  on the histogram?

  2. What bin width or range would you like to use for the ''Price'' axis on the histogram?

  3. Should the ''Period'' data on the x-axis be displayed in a specific format (e.g.,
  yearly, monthly)?

  4. Would you like specific title or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you would like the colors to be displayed
  in the legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for font size or style for labels and legends?

  7. Would you like any gridlines or specific tick marks on the axes?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to include on the
  histogram?'
