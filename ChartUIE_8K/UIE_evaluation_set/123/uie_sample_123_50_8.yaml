initial_prompt: I need a column chart displaying the Price distribution over different
  Periods from the provided dataset. Visualize each Period on the x-axis and the corresponding
  Price on the y-axis, highlighting the highest and lowest Prices distinctly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest prices to be highlighted (e.g., different
  colors, labels, markers)?

  3. Would you prefer any specific labeling style for the axes?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines in the chart?

  5. Should there be a title and labels for the axes, and if so, do you have any specific
  text in mind?

  6. Do you want to display data values directly on top of the columns?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the Periods to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., chronological)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, what should it describe?

  9. Are there any specific font preferences for text elements in the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the chart background to be of a specific color?'
