initial_prompt: Create a violin plot for Apple Stocks using historical data from December
  1980. The plot should display the distribution of 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close',
  'Adj Close', and 'Volume'. Highlight significant elements like peaks and troughs
  for clarity. Annotate key data points to draw attention to interesting trends or
  anomalies. This will help in understanding the volatilities and trading patterns

  view of the stock's performance during this period. Please ensure the plot is clear
  and informative.
