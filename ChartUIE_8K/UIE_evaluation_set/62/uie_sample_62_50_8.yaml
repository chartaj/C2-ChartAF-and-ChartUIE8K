initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the Apple stock price fluctuations over
  time. Use Date for the x-axis and the different price types (Open, High, Low, Close,
  Adj Close) for the y-axis. Highlight volume intensity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to represent different
  ranges of stock prices?

  2. How would you like the volume intensity to be highlighted—through color gradients
  or annotations?

  3. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include for the axes or overall
  chart?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for the date axis (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  5. Do you want to include any specific annotations or markers to highlight key dates
  or events in the stock price history?

  6. Is there a particular layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?

  7. Would you like grid lines or borders around each cell in the heatmap to enhance
  readability?

  8. Are there any reference lines or bands you want to include to indicate significant
  price levels or time periods?

  9. How do you prefer to handle missing data points, if any—should they be interpolated,
  left blank, or handled in another specific way?

  10. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the labels and annotations?'
