initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the columns
  in the Apple Stocks dataset. Use columns such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close,
  and Volume. The heatmap should highlight how these variables are related over the
  given time period. Make sure to color code the correlations, with stronger correlations
  having more intense colors. This will help identify any patterns or relationships
  between stock prices and trading volume over time. Include a color bar for reference.
  Make sure the date range and sample size are clearly indicated in titles or labels.
