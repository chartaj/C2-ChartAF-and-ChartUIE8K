initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the fuel efficiency of various
  car models over the years. Plot the 'year' on the x-axis and 'comb08' (combined
  MPG) on the y-axis. Use different colors to distinguish between fuel types (e.g.,
  'fuelType1'). This will help understand trends in fuel efficiency improvements over
  time and how different fuel types perform. I want to compare the potential money
  savings when using an electric car versus traditional gasoline cars. Highlight any
  extreme values or outliers in the dataset. This will aid in understanding the financial
  benefits of switching to electric cars.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between different
  fuel types?

  2. Should data points representing electric cars be highlighted in a specific way?

  3. Do you want to include trend lines or regression lines for each fuel type?

  4. How would you like outliers to be highlighted on the scatter plot?

  5. Should the axis labels and title have any specific fonts or styles?

  6. Would you prefer the y-axis to use a logarithmic scale for better visibility
  of variations?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the marker shapes of the different fuel types?

  8. Should there be annotations or tooltips for data points that provide additional
  information?

  9. Do you want a legend to be included, and if so, should it be placed in a specific
  location?'
