initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart illustrating the relationship between
  fuel cost, CO2 emissions, and city mileage for different car models and makes. The
  x-axis should represent the fuel cost (fuelCost08), the y-axis should represent
  CO2 emissions (co2TailpipeGpm), and the bubble size should indicate the city mileage
  (city08). Additionally, use different colors to differentiate between car makes.
  This chart will help visualize how different models compare in terms of cost efficiency
  and environmental impact, aiding in deciding potential savings and benefits from
  switching to more efficient vehicles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred chart title?

  2. Would you like to include a legend? If yes, where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate car
  makes?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units displayed beside the
  axis titles?

  5. Do you have a specific range you want to set for the x-axis (fuel cost) or y-axis
  (CO2 emissions)?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be for
  both the x and y axes?

  7. Is there a specific font or font size you prefer for the axis labels, title,
  or legend?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the bubble sizes'' scale or range?

  9. Would you like to include data labels (e.g., car model names) directly on the
  bubbles? If yes, how would you like them to be positioned?

  10. Do you prefer a specific background color or style for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a legend. I do not know where to position it.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Fuel Cost (USD)", and the y-axis should be
  labeled "CO2 Emissions (grams per mile)".

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines for both the x and y axes.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, include data labels with car model names. I am not sure about the positioning.

  10. I do not know.'
