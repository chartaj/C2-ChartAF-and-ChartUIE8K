initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the potential savings in fuel
  costs when switching from regular gasoline vehicles to electric cars. Use the 'fuelCost08'
  data from the dataset to show the cost of fueling conventional cars across different
  regions. Highlight the regions where new electric cars offer the most significant
  savings. Additionally, indicate the fuel type with 'fuelType1' to compare different
  gasolines as well, and denote 'year' to see trends over time. This map will help
  users identify areas with the highest financial benefits from using electric vehicles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or color palette for the choropleth
  map?

  2. Should we use a specific range or number of bins for the cost savings categories?

  3. Do you prefer any particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers, Robinson)?

  4. How would you like to handle regions with missing data or insufficient information?

  5. Would you like to display the data for all years collectively or split by each
  year?

  6. Do you want labels or annotations for specific regions with highest/lowest savings?

  7. Should the map include a legend or key for interpreting the fuel types and cost
  savings?

  8. Is there a preferred geographic region or set of regions you would like to focus
  on (e.g., country, state, city-level)?

  9. Would you like to include tooltips with additional information when hovering
  over regions?

  10. How would you like to represent different fuel types visually on the map (e.g.,
  different color hues, patterns)?'
