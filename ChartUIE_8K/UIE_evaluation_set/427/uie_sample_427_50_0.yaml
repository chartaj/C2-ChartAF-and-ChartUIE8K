initial_prompt: Please create a column chart comparing the fuel cost and CO2 emissions
  of various car models from 1985, highlighting the savings with electric alternatives.
  Include annotations for fuel cost and CO2 emissions for each car model to emphasize
  the differences.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting electric alternatives
  and traditional car models?

  2. Would you like a specific ordering of car models on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by fuel cost, or by CO2 emissions)?

  3. Are there any specific labels or descriptions you want included in the annotations
  for fuel cost and CO2 emissions?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart?

  7. Should the chart include error bars if the data contains variability?

  8. Are there any specific legends or labels you want to include for different categories
  of car models?

  9. Do you have a preference for the placement of annotations (e.g., above the bars,
  alongside the bars)?

  10. Would you like to include a reference line to highlight average values of fuel
  cost and CO2 emissions?'
