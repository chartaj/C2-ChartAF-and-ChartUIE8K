initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the annual fuel cost savings of different
  car models when switching to electric. Use the data from 427.csv, focusing on the
  columns 'make', 'model', 'fuelCost08', and 'youSaveSpend'. Display car models on
  the x-axis, and the fuel costs and savings on the y-axis as two separate bars for
  each model. Highlight the models with the highest and lowest savings prominently
  for better visualization of cost-effectiveness in switching to electric cars.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. How would you like the models with the highest and lowest savings to be highlighted?
  (e.g., different color, outline, bold labels)

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the car models on the x-axis? (e.g., alphabetically,
  by savings amount)

  4. Would you like data labels to be displayed on the bars showing the exact values?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart titles and labels?

  6. Should the chart include a legend explaining the colors of the bars representing
  fuel cost and savings?

  7. Do you have a specific title for the chart in mind?'
