initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the relationship between city and highway
  fuel economy (city08, highway08) and the fuel costs (fuelCost08) for different car
  makes and models. Highlight areas that can help identify the most economical options.
questions: '1. What specific color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap (e.g.,
  cool tones, warm tones, or a specific palette)?

  2. Do you prefer the axes to be labeled in a particular way?

  3. Would you like to include a legend that explains the color intensity or gradient?
  If yes, where should it be positioned?

  4. Should the data points be displayed with value annotations for each cell in the
  heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the gridline style (e.g., solid, dashed, or no
  gridlines)?

  6. Would you like to highlight the most economical car models with a specific color
  or marker?

  7. Should the heatmap have any specific title or subtitle?

  8. Do you want to add any specific notes or footnotes on the heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer specific font styles or sizes for labels and title texts?

  10. Is there a particular way you would like the data to be ordered on the axes
  (e.g., alphabetically by make/model, by fuel efficiency, or by fuel cost)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I am not sure where it should be positioned.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, I would like to highlight the most economical car models with a specific
  color.

  7. The title should be "Fuel Economy vs. Fuel Cost for Car Makes and Models."

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. The data should be ordered by fuel efficiency.'
