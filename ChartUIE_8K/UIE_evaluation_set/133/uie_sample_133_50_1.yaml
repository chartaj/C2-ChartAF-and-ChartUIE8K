initial_prompt: Create a histogram of hourly bike rentals from the London bike sharing
  dataset, highlighting weekends in a different color. Add annotations indicating
  average rentals on holidays versus non-holidays.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for weekdays and weekends?

  2. What format would you prefer for the annotations indicating average rentals on
  holidays versus non-holidays (e.g., text, arrows)?

  3. Should the histogram bins be hourly, or would you prefer a different time aggregation
  (e.g., every 3 hours)?

  4. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes and legend?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the histogram for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text elements in the
  chart?

  8. Do you want a distinction between public holidays and weekends, or just an overall
  differentiation?
