initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing millionaire density by country
  using the Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023). Highlight countries with the highest
  final worth and annotate top billionaires, indicating their net worth and industry.
  Include data on GDP, life expectancy, and primary and tertiary education enrollment
  for additional context. The map should distinguish countries clearly, emphasizing
  those with significant billionaire populations and economic indicators. The purpose
  is to give a clear geographical distribution of billionaires globally, spotlighting
  economic factors tied to wealth accumulation. Make it visually appealing and easy
  to understand for general audiences.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the Choropleth map?

  2. Should specific regions or countries be emphasized with distinct colors or shades?

  3. Do you want any specific geographical boundaries or mapping projections (e.g.,
  Mercator, Robinson)?

  4. Are there particular fonts or font styles you prefer for annotations and labels?

  5. How detailed should the annotations for top billionaires be (e.g., just net worth
  and industry, or more information)?

  6. Should there be a legend that explains the color coding for different ranges
  of millionaire density?

  7. Do you prefer the inclusion of any specific economic indicators in the legend
  or side panel for additional context?

  8. Would you like any interactive tooltip or static label features for each country
  when hovering over them?

  9. Do you have a preference for the map''s orientation and centering (e.g., centered
  on the equator, a specific country, or region)?

  10. Should there be a title and subtitle on the map? If so, do you have preferred
  wording for either?'
