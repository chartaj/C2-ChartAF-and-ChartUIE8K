initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the top 3 billionaires from the Billionaires
  Statistics Dataset (2023). Use their final worth as the y-axis and their names as
  the x-axis. Highlight Bernard Arnault & family, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos with different
  colors. Add data-driven text annotations for each bar to display their final worth.
  This chart will help compare the wealth of the top billionaires and understand the
  distribution of wealth among them. Ensure annotations are clear to focus attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a legend identifying the different colors for each billionaire?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the background of the chart for better readability?

  6. Would you like the bars to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., ascending,
  descending)?

  7. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the chart layout?

  8. Should additional text or legends be added to provide more context or explanations?

  the chart?'
