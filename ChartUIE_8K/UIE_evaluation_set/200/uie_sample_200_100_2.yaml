initial_prompt: Visualize a grouped bar chart to display the count of students based
  on their 'AcademicPerformance' and 'Gender'. Each group should differentiate between
  genders (Male, Female) and within each group, use different colors to represent
  categories in 'AcademicPerformance' (Average, Excellent, Poor, Good). Add text annotations
  to highlight bars with 'Excellent' performance. Highlight the bar with the highest
  count using a different color. This will help in understanding the gender differences
  in academic performance. Title the chart "Gender vs Academic Performance of Students".
  Use annotations and highlights to enhance insights.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for differentiating between ''Male'' and
  ''Female'' groups?

  2. What color would you like to use for highlighting the ''Excellent'' performance
  category?

  3. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting the bar with the highest
  count?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  bold)?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart margins and spacing between
  bars?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be for both axes
  or only one (x-axis or y-axis)?

  9. Should the bars have any particular styling (e.g., borders, shadow effects)?'
