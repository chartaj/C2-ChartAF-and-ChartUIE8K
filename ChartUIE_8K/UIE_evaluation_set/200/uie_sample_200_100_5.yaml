initial_prompt: 'Please create a donut chart to present the data of the psychosocial
  aspects of student life, as detailed in the datasheet. The chart should focus on
  the Academic Performance of students categorized by their Depression Status. I''d
  like to see how the distribution of academic performance varies for students who
  report different levels of depression (''Sometimes'', ''Yes'', ''No''). Use the
  available data columns: ''AcademicPerformance'' and ''DepressionStatus''. The inner
  ring should represent the depression status and the outer ring should display the
  corresponding academic performance levels. I want all relevant categories visible
  for clear insight.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you''d like
  to use for the different depression statuses and academic performance levels?

  2. Should the chart include labels for each segment in both the inner and outer
  rings?

  3. Do you want to display percentages, actual counts, or both for each category
  in the donut chart?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you''d like the depression statuses to be
  displayed in the inner ring (e.g., ''No'', ''Sometimes'', ''Yes'')?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., right, bottom, left)?

  6. Should the chart title and axis labels follow any specific format or text style
  (e.g., font, size, weight)?

  7. Are there any particular guidelines or constraints for the chart size and dimensions?

  8. Do you prefer any specific tool or software for creating the chart?'
