initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of students' depression
  status. This should show the percentage of students who report 'Yes', 'Sometimes',
  and 'No' for their depression status. The categories for the pie chart should be
  color-coded for clarity. Also, ensure the chart includes labels with the actual
  percentage values for each category. Given that this data focuses on the psychological
  aspects of student life, this chart will help understand the overall mental health
  status of the students surveyed.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  3. Do you require a legend alongside the color-coded categories?

  4. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels and percentages?

  5. Should the chart include a description or annotation for better context?

  6. Is there a specific order in which the categories should be displayed (e.g.,
  ''Yes'', ''Sometimes'', ''No'')?

  7. Would you like any specific patterns or textures used to differentiate the segments
  further?'
