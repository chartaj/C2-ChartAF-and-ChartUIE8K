initial_prompt: I'd like a Treemap chart to visualize the psychosocial dimensions
  of student life data. In the chart, categorize students by 'Gender' and within each
  gender, break down by 'AcademicPerformance'. Then, further subdivide each category
  by 'DepressionStatus' and 'SleepPerDayHours'. Color-code the sections by 'FaceChallangesToCompleteAcademicTask'.
  This will help us understand how different factors interplay in students' lives.
  Please ensure it's clear and easy to follow, displaying data hierarchically to see
  patterns and correlations among the variables. Use the sample data to guide the
  chart illustration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the sections based on ''FaceChallangesToCompleteAcademicTask''?

  2. What level of detail or granularity are you looking for in the hierarchical breakdowns?

  3. How do you prefer to handle overlapping or very small sections in the Treemap?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be displayed within the
  Treemap?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the categories (e.g., ''Gender'', ''AcademicPerformance'',
  ''DepressionStatus'', ''SleepPerDayHours'') to appear in?

  6. Should any particular categories or values be emphasized or highlighted more
  than others?

  7. Do you have preferences for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the Treemap?

  8. Would you like to include any statistical summaries or legends in the visualization?'
