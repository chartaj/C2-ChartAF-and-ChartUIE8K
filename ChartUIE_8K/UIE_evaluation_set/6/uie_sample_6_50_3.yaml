initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the maize yield across different
  countries over the years. Highlight missing data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to have specific color gradients for missing data points?

  3. How would you like to handle the scale of maize yield values (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular color scheme for different countries?

  5. Should the data be aggregated or smoothed over specific time intervals?

  6. Do you require labels for specific data points or ranges on the heatmap?

  7. Should we include a legend to explain the color gradients and missing data points?

  8. Do you have any preferred dimensions or aspect ratio for the heatmap?'
