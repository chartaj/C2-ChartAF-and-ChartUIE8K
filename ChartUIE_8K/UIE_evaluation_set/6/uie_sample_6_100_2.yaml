initial_prompt: Visualize a scatter plot showing maize yield over different years
  categorized by countries. Use the dataset provided to create the plot. Highlight
  countries with constant maize yield over the years to examine agricultural persistence.
  Annotate specific critical years with high or unexpected drop in maize yield to
  help emphasize years of significant agricultural events. Ensure missing values are
  appropriately managed. This visualization aims to understand trends and anomalies
  in maize yield to inform agricultural policies and strategies. Use text annotations
  for notable observations and highlight key data points that stand out.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the scatter plot?

  2. Should we use different markers or shapes to distinguish between countries?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be visualized or handled in the plot?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for highlighting the key data points
  and notable observations?

  6. Should there be any specific labels or legends included in the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for the plot (e.g., size, aspect ratio)?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines or background patterns in the scatter plot?

  9. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences on the axis labels or scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?'
