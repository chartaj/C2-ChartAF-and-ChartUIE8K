initial_prompt: I'd like a Treemap visualizing the maize yield across different countries
  over the years. The data file provided shows various countries, their codes, maize
  yields, and corresponding years. Each block in the treemap should represent a country,
  with the size proportional to the maize yield. Inside these blocks, smaller sections
  should represent different years. This will help in understanding how maize yield
  has varied over time in different regions. It's important to highlight the regions
  with missing maize yield values so that data gaps can be easily identified. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  countries or years in the treemap?

  2. How would you like the missing maize yield values to be highlighted in the treemap?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout or orientation for the blocks within the
  treemap?

  4. Should there be any specific labeling inside the blocks, such as country names,
  year, or maize yield values?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or legends you would like included in the
  treemap to enhance readability?

  6. Would you like to include tooltips or hover information for more detailed data
  insights?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall appearance or theme of the treemap (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed, colorful)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Highlight missing maize yield values with a specific color, maybe gray.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Label the blocks with country names and years.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not need tooltips or hover information since I want an image.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
