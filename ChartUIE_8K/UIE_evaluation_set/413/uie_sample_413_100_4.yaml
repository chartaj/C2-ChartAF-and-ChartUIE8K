initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of the
  "year_of_birth" of astronauts. I want to see the frequency of astronauts' birth
  years. The chart should highlight the range of birth years and show any peaks or
  trends. Additionally, it would be helpful if you could color-code based on nationality
  to see if there's any pattern or difference between astronauts from different countries.
  This will help me understand the demographics of astronauts better. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different nationalities?

  2. What range of birth years are you particularly interested in, or should the entire
  range be displayed?

  3. Would you prefer the bins of the histogram to be of a specific width? If so,
  what width?

  4. Should the histogram display exact counts or percentages on the Y-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the title or labels of the X and Y axes?

  6. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the legend?'
