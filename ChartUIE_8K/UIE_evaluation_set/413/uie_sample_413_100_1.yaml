initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the total number of missions over
  time for selected astronauts. Incorporate text annotations to highlight key milestones,
  such as the first mission or the longest mission duration, emphasizing important
  individual contributions. Use color highlights to distinguish between different
  nationalities. This visualization should clearly show how space exploration efforts
  have evolved and which astronauts made significant contributions over the years,
  according to the given data. The chart will provide insights into the progression
  of space missions and the individuals who played crucial roles.
