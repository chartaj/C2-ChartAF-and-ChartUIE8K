initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart visualizing information from the provided astronaut
  data. Specifically, I want to see a comparison of the total hours spent on missions
  by each astronaut. The x-axis should represent the astronauts' names, while the
  y-axis should show their total mission hours. This chart should help me visualize
  which astronauts have the highest mission hours, which could correlate with their
  experience and time spent in space, reflecting the context of traveling to outer
  space. Can you please create this bar chart for me? Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. Do you want the chart to include grid lines for easier comparison?

  4. Should there be any specific labels or annotations on the bars to highlight the
  highest mission hours?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to include a legend in the chart, even if it''s a single series?

  7. Is there a specific format you want the y-axis values to be displayed in (e.g.,
  with decimal places, rounded to the nearest whole number)?

  8. Should we include axis titles in addition to the axis labels?

  9. Do you have a preferred background color for the chart area?

  10. Would you like to have any reference lines or markers indicating certain critical
  values or thresholds in mission hours?'
