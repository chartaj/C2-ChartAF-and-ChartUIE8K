initial_prompt: 'Please create a column chart to visualize the data on the project
  costs overruns. Each column should represent a different project: Elbphilharmonie,
  Electronic Health Insurance Card, and Flughafen Berlin. For each project, there
  should be two columns side by side, one for Planned costs and another for Actual
  costs. Include the exact cost values for clarity, and make sure the chart is easy
  to understand for a general audience interested in government spending. Thank you!'

  \ lines in the chart for better readability?\n3. Do you have a preference for the\
  \ font style and size for the labels and titles in the chart?\n4. Should the chart\
  \ include a legend to clearly distinguish between 'Planned costs' and 'Actual costs'?\n\
  5. Do you want to add any specific annotations or notes to highlight key points\
  \ or findings in the chart? \n6. Would you like the columns to be displayed in a\
  \ particular order, such as sorted by project name or by cost values?\n7. Is there\

  \ in a particular way?"
