initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the planned and actual costs
  of government projects. The x-axis should represent the projects, and the y-axis
  should show the costs in millions of Euros. Compare the planned costs against the
  actual costs.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns representing
  planned and actual costs?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  3. Do you want to include labels for each bar in the chart indicating the exact
  cost values?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the labels and titles?

  5. Should grid lines be included in the chart for better readability? If so, do
  you prefer vertical, horizontal, or both types of grid lines?

  6. Would you like to add annotations for any specific projects to provide additional
  context?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the projects on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by planned costs, by actual costs)?

  8. Is there a preferred style for the y-axis (e.g., starting point, scale, intervals)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the planned and actual
