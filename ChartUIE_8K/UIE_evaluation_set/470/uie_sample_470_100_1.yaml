initial_prompt: Create a Dumbbell chart visualizing the cost overruns of government
  projects. The x-axis should represent costs in billions of Euros, while the y-axis
  lists each project. Plot planned costs as the left end of the dumbbell and actual
  costs as the right end. Use color highlights to differentiate between planned and
  actual costs. Include annotations to emphasize the dramatic increase in costs for
  key projects like the Elbphilharmonie, Electronic Health Insurance Card, and Flughafen
  Berlin. The visualization should clearly show the disparity between initial estimates
  and final expenditures.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating between
  planned and actual costs?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability of cost
  values?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?

  4. Do you have a preference for the overall layout and aspect ratio of the chart
  (e.g., more wide than tall)?

  5. Should the axis labels (costs in billions of Euros and project names) be formatted
  in any specific style?

  6. Are there any particular visual elements you would like to add to emphasize the
  disparity between planned and actual costs?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color highlights used in the
  chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the annotation locations or styles for the key
  projects?'
