initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize the data from the CSV file. The x-axis
  should represent the 'Planned costs' in Billion Euros, and the y-axis should represent
  the 'Actual costs' in Billion Euros. Each project's description should be shown
  on the dot's hover text for better clarity. Please make sure the dots are labeled
  with the respective project names like 'Elbphilharmonie', 'Electronic Health Insurance
  Card', and 'Flughafen Berlin'. Use different colors for each project to distinguish
  them easily. Make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  projects?

  2. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you would like used for the labels and
  hover text?

  3. Would you prefer the chart to have gridlines for better reference, or would you
  prefer a cleaner look without them?

  4. Should the axis labels include units (e.g., ''Billion Euros'') for clarity?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement of the project names on the dots (e.g.,
  above, below, beside)?

  6. Are there any specific margin or padding requirements for the chart to fit into
  a particular layout or document?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend to further explain the color coding
  of the projects?

  8. Do you prefer a specific style for the dots (e.g., circles, squares, custom shapes)?'
