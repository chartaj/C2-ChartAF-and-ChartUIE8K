initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize Netflix Movies and TV Shows data,
  highlighting distributions of unique titles by country. Use text annotations to
  display values of missing directors and cast data. Highlight the two most common
  countries and their unique titles. The chart should help compare content availability
  across different nations and understand the impact of missing values on dataset
  completeness. Please ensure practical insights about country-based content diversity
  are highlighted for users.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the colors used to highlight the
  two most common countries?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a specific title and subtitle? If so, what should
  they be?

  3. Do you prefer the bar chart to be horizontal or vertical?

  4. How would you like the text annotations for missing values to be formatted (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between movies and TV shows,
  or would you prefer a different categorization?

  6. Are there any specific countries you want to make sure are included or excluded
  in the visualization?

  7. Do you have a preference for the scale of the x-axis and y-axis (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or labels besides the missing
  values for directors and cast?

  9. Is there a specific sorting preference for the countries (e.g., alphabetical,
  by the number of unique titles)?

  10. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability? If
  so, would you prefer them to be light or bold?'
