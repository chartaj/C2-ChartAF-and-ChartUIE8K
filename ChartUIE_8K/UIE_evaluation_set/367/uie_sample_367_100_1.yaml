initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the release trend of Netflix titles
  over the years. Highlight the highest and lowest points for each type (Movie, TV
  Show) using contrasting colors. Add text annotations to indicate these points with
  their respective release years and counts. Include axis labels and a legend to differentiate
  between Movies and TV Shows. This chart will help understand the growth or decline
  in content released by type over time, according to the provided dataset. Ensure
  the visualization is clear and informative, fitting the context of Netflix content
  analysis.
