initial_prompt: Create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of movies and
  TV shows by release year from the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. The x-axis
  should show release years, and the y-axis should represent the count of titles released
  in each year. The histogram should have separate color bars for 'Movies' and 'TV
  Shows' to distinguish between the two types. This will help understand trends in
  the number of releases over different years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating ''Movies''
  and ''TV Shows'' in the histogram?

  2. What specific range of years would you like to focus on, if any?

  3. Are there any particular years you would like to highlight or annotate on the
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific bar width or spacing between bars?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preferences for axis labels and title fonts or sizes?

  7. Should we include a legend to identify the categories of ''Movies'' and ''TV
  Shows''?

  8. Is there any additional information you would like to display, such as average
  releases per year?

  9. Would you like the chart to include data labels showing the count of titles for
  each year?'
