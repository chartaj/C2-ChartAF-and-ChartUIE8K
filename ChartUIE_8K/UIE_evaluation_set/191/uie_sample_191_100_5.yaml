initial_prompt: I'd like to create a bar chart that visualizes the characteristics
  of brain tumor images. Please plot the mean, variance, standard deviation, entropy,
  skewness, and kurtosis for the image classes (0 and 1). Each attribute should have
  two bars representing their values for each class. Make sure the x-axis has the
  attributes and the y-axis has the respective values. The legend should indicate
  the classes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the bar colors for each class?

  2. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  4. Should the y-axis be labeled with specific units or any other details?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability? If yes, vertical,
  horizontal, or both?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or data labels on the bars for clarity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. I would prefer the legend to be placed on the right.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Both vertical and horizontal grid lines would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.'
