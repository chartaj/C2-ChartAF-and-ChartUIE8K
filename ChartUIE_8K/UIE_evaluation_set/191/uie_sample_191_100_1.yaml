initial_prompt: I need a dot plot visualizing the brain tumor data. Highlight the
  Class and Mean columns for each data point, reflecting different tumor classes distinctly.
  Incorporate text annotations for outliers in the Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation
  columns to draw attention to unusual cases. This will help easily identify data
  points with significant deviations, aiding in quick insights and analysis. The chart
  purpose is to enhance understanding of the brain tumor data distribution and enable
  a focused review of critical statistical measures. Include context and any relevant
  editorial comments in the annotations for further clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating tumor
  classes?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be marked with a specific shape or size?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart layout, such as title position
  or legend placement?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included on the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific scale (e.g., logarithmic) for the axes?

  7. Should we include axis labels and if so, do you have specific text for them?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the annotation position relative to the outliers?

  9. Would you like the chart to include a brief description or context at the beginning
  to help the audience understand the data better?'
