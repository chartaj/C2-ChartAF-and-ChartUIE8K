initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart displaying the statistical properties
  of brain tumor images. Use columns for Mean, Variance, Standard Deviation, Entropy,
  Skewness, Kurtosis, Contrast, Energy, ASM, Homogeneity, Dissimilarity, Correlation,
  and Coarseness. Each column should represent a different image, and each stack should
  indicate the measurement value for that property. Ensure both Class 0 and Class
  1 data are distinctly visualized. This will help in understanding the distribution
  and variability in these properties across different classes of brain tumor images.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for visualizing Class 0 and Class
  1 data?

  2. How would you like the measurement values to be displayed on each stack (e.g.,
  as a label with the exact value, percentage, or neither)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the statistical properties (e.g., Mean first,
  Variance second)?

  4. Is there a specific range or scale for the y-axis that you would prefer?

  5. Are there any gridline or axis preferences you have (e.g., major/minor gridlines,
  axis titles)?

  6. Would you like a legend to distinguish between different classes or statistical
  properties?

  7. Do you have any font or style preferences for labels and titles?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include in
  the chart?

  9. Do you prefer certain elements to be emphasized or highlighted in the chart (e.g.,
  maximum values, particular images)?

  10. Do you have preferences for the orientation of the chart (e.g., vertical vs.
  horizontal stacked columns)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Exact values would be fine.

  3. I do not have a specific order preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have any specific preferences for gridlines or axis titles.

  6. Yes, a legend to distinguish between different classes would be helpful.

  7. I do not have any font or style preferences.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Vertical stacked columns are preferred.'
