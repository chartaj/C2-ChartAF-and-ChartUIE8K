initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart for the dataset provided on brain tumor
  health. The box chart should include the following features: Mean, Variance, Standard
  Deviation, Entropy, Skewness, Kurtosis, Contrast, Energy, ASM, Homogeneity, Dissimilarity,
  and Correlation. Ensure the chart visually distinguishes between the two classes
  (0 and 1). This will help to compare the statistical properties and dispersion measures
  for both classes effectively. The chart should have appropriate labels and a legend
  for clarity.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for distinguishing between the
  two classes (0 and 1)?

  2. Would you like the mean to be displayed as a distinct marker on the box chart?

  3. Is there a specific order in which you would like the statistical properties
  to be displayed on the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style and size of the labels and legends
  in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the box chart for
  better readability?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, perhaps use contrasting colors for clarity.

  2. Yes, I would like the mean to be displayed as a distinct marker.

  3. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  4. I am not sure about the style and size; go with something standard and readable.

  5. I do not know, just standard titles and annotations should be fine.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  7. I do not have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions.'
