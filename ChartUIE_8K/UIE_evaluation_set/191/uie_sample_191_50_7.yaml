initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing how the 'Mean', 'Variance', and 'Standard
  Deviation' changes across different 'Images' for two different 'Classes' in brain
  tumor health data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme or specific colors to
  represent the two different ''Classes''?

  2. Would you like the lines for ''Mean'', ''Variance'', and ''Standard Deviation''
  to be in different styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. Should there be markers at each data point on the lines, and if so, what style
  or shape do you prefer for the markers?

  4. Do you want grid lines in the background of the chart for better readability?
  If yes, would you prefer them to be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to identify the different lines and classes,
  and where would you prefer it to be placed (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you want to include axis titles, and if so, what should they be?

  8. Should the y-axis be on a specific scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Would you like to add labels to the data points, showing their exact values?

  10. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart titles,
  labels, and legend?'
