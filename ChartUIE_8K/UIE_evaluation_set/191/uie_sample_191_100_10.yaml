initial_prompt: I have data on brain tumor characteristics stored in CSV files, with
  details like image IDs, class labels, and various statistical metrics (mean, variance,
  entropy, etc.). I'd like to create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution
  of 'Class' labels (0 and 1) among all the images. This should help in understanding
  the proportion of different classes in the dataset. Please ensure the pie chart
  segments clearly represent these proportions, with labels or a legend indicating
  which segment corresponds to which class label. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart segments?

  2. Would you prefer the class labels to be displayed directly on the segments or
  in a separate legend?

  3. Do you want the percentage of each segment to be displayed on the pie chart?

  4. Should the pie chart have a title or any additional annotations?

  5. Is there a preferred ordering of segments (e.g., descending order by proportion)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  7. Would you like the chart to include any additional visual elements such as 3D
  effects or shadows?

  8. Are there any specific accessibility considerations we should integrate into
  the pie chart design?'
