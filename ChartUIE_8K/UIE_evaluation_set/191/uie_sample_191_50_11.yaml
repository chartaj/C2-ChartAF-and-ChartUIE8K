questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different bars representing
  Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation?

  2. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the metrics (Mean, Variance, Standard
  Deviation) within each class group?

  3. Would you like to include error bars to indicate variability or uncertainty in
  the measurements?

  4. How would you prefer to label each group of bars (e.g., including the metric
  names on the x-axis or using a legend)?
