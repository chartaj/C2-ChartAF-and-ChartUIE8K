initial_prompt: I have a dataset on brain tumor classification with various statistical
  features for images. Can you create a scatter plot showing the relationship between
  the Mean and Variance of the images? Use different colors to distinguish between
  the two classes. I want to see how these two features correlate and if there's any
  visual distinction between the classes based on these attributes. Make the points
  clearly visible and the axes appropriately labeled for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer for distinguishing the two
  classes?

  2. What style or size of points do you prefer for the scatter plot?

  3. Do you have preferences for the font size or style used for labeling the axes?

  4. Would you like a legend included to indicate which color corresponds to which
  class?

  5. Is there any specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  6. Do you want gridlines included in the background of the scatter plot for better
  readability?

  7. Are there any specific ranges you would like to set for the axes?

  8. Do you prefer any particular layout orientation or aspect ratio for the scatter
  plot?'
