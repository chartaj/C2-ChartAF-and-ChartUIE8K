initial_prompt: Create a bar chart from the provided "wwc_outcomes" data set, focusing
  on visualizing the number of wins for each team (as given by the win_status column)
  across different years. The chart should have years on the x-axis and the number
  of wins on the y-axis. Each bar should represent a team, and different colors should
  be used for different teams. This will help in understanding which teams performed
  best over the years in the sports-and-recreation context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  teams?

  2. Would you like the years on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific format (e.g.,
  full year, abbreviated)?

  3. How would you like the labels on the x-axis and y-axis to be formatted (e.g.,
  font size, font type)?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If so, do you prefer them for both axes
  or just one?

  5. Do you have a preference for the width of the bars in the bar chart?

  6. Would you like to display data values on top of each bar?

  7. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) on the chart?

  8. Are there specific years or teams you want to highlight in the chart?

  9. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis titles other than the default
  ''Years'' for the x-axis and ''Number of Wins'' for the y-axis?'
