initial_prompt: I want a column chart to visualize the wwc_outcomes data. Could you
  show the average scores of each team in different rounds over the years? We want
  separate columns for each round, and each team's score should be represented next
  to each other for comparison. Additionally, highlight any teams that consistently
  win or lose by a significant margin (perhaps by different colors). This is for a
  sports-and-recreation context to analyze performance trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the teams that consistently win or lose by a significant margin
  to be highlighted (e.g., specific colors, patterns)?

  3. Would you prefer a specific ordering of the teams within each round?

  4. Is there a particular arrangement of the rounds (e.g., chronological, significance)
  you''d like to see?

  5. Do you want gridlines in the background to facilitate comparison?

  6. Are there specific labels or annotations you need to be included on the chart
  (e.g., average scores, team names, years)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding for teams with
  significant performance margins?

  8. Is there a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and axes?

  9. Should we display data values on top of each column for clarity?

  10. Do you want to include titles for the chart and axes? If so, any specific titles?'
