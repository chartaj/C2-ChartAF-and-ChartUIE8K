initial_prompt: Create a box chart displaying the distribution of scores for each
  team across different rounds in women's world cup outcomes. Compare score ranges
  per team.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Should the box chart show individual data points in addition to the boxplot summary
  statistics (e.g., using a strip plot or a swarm plot)?

  3. Do you want to include labels for outliers in the chart?

  4. Do you prefer to display the medians inside the boxes, or would you rather have
  a separate legend for central tendency markers?

  5. Would you like the chart to include annotations or textual descriptions explaining
  specific data points or trends?

  6. Should the x-axis or y-axis have a log scale, or will a linear scale suffice?

  7. Do you want to add grid lines to the background for easier reading of values?

  8. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  9. Do you need each team to be represented in a specific order, or is an alphabetical
  order acceptable?

  10. Would you like to include additional visuals, like mean or median lines, to
  emphasize central tendency across teams?'
