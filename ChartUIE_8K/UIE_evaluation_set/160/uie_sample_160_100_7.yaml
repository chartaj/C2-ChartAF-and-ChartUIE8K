initial_prompt: I have data from the Women's World Cup outcomes detailing years, teams,
  scores, rounds, yearly game IDs, team numbers, and win statuses. Please create a
  donut chart to visualize the win status distribution (Won, Lost, Draw) across all
  teams. This chart should help in understanding the overall performance trends of
  different teams in the tournament spanning multiple years. The dataset contains
  no missing values and has unique win statuses for comparison. Make sure the chart
  highlights the proportion of each win status in a visually appealing manner suitable
  for sports analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different win statuses ("Won",
  "Lost", "Draw")?

  2. Would you like the chart to display percentage values on each segment?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels in the chart?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the win statuses to be presented
  in the chart?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the donut chart''s segments?

  7. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  8. Do you want the chart to show the total number of games in the center of the
  donut?

  9. Are there any specific team names or years you would like to highlight in the
  chart?'
