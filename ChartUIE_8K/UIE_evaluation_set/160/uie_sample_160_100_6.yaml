initial_prompt: I want to visualize the performance outcomes of different teams across
  various years in a WWC tournament. Could you create a box plot that shows the distribution
  of scores for each team? Make sure to group the scores by team and denote different
  rounds, like 'Group' or other stages. The x-axis should represent different teams,
  and the y-axis should represent the scores. Including the round as a color or shape
  factor within the boxes would be great for distinguishing performance per stage.
  This way, we can see how team performance varies and identify any outliers or trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  differentiate between rounds?

  2. Would you like the box plots to include additional statistical markers such as
  median, quartiles, or mean?

  3. Do you prefer a specific ordering of the teams on the x-axis, such as alphabetical
  or by performance?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading to improve readability?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the labeling of the axes, for instance, how detailed
  or large the font should be?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels directly on the
  plot for better context?

  7. Do you prefer any specific dimensions or aspect ratio for the chart to fit the
  intended display medium?

  8. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color or shape factors used
  to denote different rounds?

  9. Are there any specific teams or rounds you want to highlight more prominently
  in the visualization?

  10. Do you need the chart to have a title or subtitle for additional context or
  clarity?'
