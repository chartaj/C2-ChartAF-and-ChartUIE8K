initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart for wwc_outcomes, visualizing year on
  the x-axis and the number of wins, losses, and draws (win_status) as stacked bars
  for each team. Highlight teams with the highest wins and provide text annotations
  for significant scores. This chart will help us understand team performance trends
  over the years. Ensure each bar segment is colored differently for clear differentiation.
  Use highlights to distinguish winning teams and add context with annotations for
  key matches. The purpose is to provide a visual summary of outcomes for sports-and-recreation
  analysis.
