initial_prompt: Visualize the "wwc_outcomes" data using a grouped bar chart to represent
  different teams' scores across years and rounds. Annotate the highest and lowest
  scores to focus viewers' attention. Use highlights to distinguish winning statuses
  by color coding. Include data-driven text annotations for yearly_game_id values
  for additional context. This helps in understanding team performance trends over
  time, especially in different rounds. The practical purpose is to analyze team performance
  and identify key patterns and outliers in different matches. Ensure the chart clearly
  shows win/loss status for easier comparison.

  win/loss statuses?

  styles?

  10. Do you want to include tooltips that appear on hover for additional data insights,
  such as scores or win statuses?
