initial_prompt: Visualize the World Cup outcomes data 'wwc_outcomes' using a heatmap.
  The heatmap should display 'team' on the y-axis and 'year' on the x-axis. Each cell
  should represent the 'score' of the team in a particular year. Use color gradients
  to show score intensity, making it easy to identify high-scoring teams across years.
  Additionally, differentiate win statuses ('Won', 'Lost', 'Draw') using varying hues
  (green for won, red for lost, yellow for draw) to enhance clarity. The goal is to
  quickly convey performance trends and outcomes over the years for each team in the
  Women’s World Cup.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color gradients in mind for showing score intensity?

  2. Are there any specific color codes you prefer for ''Won'', ''Lost'', and ''Draw''
  statuses?

  3. How would you like to handle years or teams with missing scores?

  4. Do you prefer the heatmap to include axis labels and titles? If yes, can you
  specify their text?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to explain the color gradients and hues, and if
  so, where should it be placed?

  7. Do you want grid lines to be visible on the heatmap for better readability?

  8. Should there be any annotations or textual information within the heatmap cells?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have specific color gradients in mind for showing score intensity.

  2. I do not know specific color codes for ''Won'', ''Lost'', and ''Draw'' statuses,
  but using green for won, red for lost, and yellow for draw is fine.

  3. I am not sure how to handle years or teams with missing scores.

  4. Yes, please include axis labels and titles. The y-axis should be labeled ''Team''
  and the x-axis ''Year''. The title can be ''Women’s World Cup Team Performance Heatmap''.

  5. I do not have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and titles.

  6. Yes, a legend explaining the color gradients and hues would be helpful. It can
  be placed on the right side of the heatmap.

  7. Yes, having grid lines visible on the heatmap would be better for readability.

  8. I am not sure if annotations or textual information within the heatmap cells
  are necessary.
