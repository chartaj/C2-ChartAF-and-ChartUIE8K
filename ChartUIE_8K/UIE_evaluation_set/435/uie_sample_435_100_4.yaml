initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot based on the BBC Greatest Hip-Hop Songs of all
  Time dataset. Plot each song's year of release on the x-axis and the number of points
  it received on the y-axis. Differentiate points by artists, marking them with different
  colors or markers to visualize which artists have the top positions across different
  years. Ensure to label the axes clearly, and include a legend for the artists. This
  visualization should help identify trends in hip-hop popularity over time and highlight
  the most influential artists in the genre.
