initial_prompt: Create a histogram highlighting the distribution of points among the
  top-rated hip-hop songs of all time. Use data annotations to display individual
  song titles and their respective points on the histogram bars. Highlight the top
  artist entries to showcase their prominence in the list. Ensure the chart clearly
  emphasizes the male-dominated nature of the genre by color-coding based on the gender
  column. Additionally, provide context on the significance of each highlighted song,
  such as its year of release and artist. The purpose is to visually explore how points
  are distributed across different years and artists.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between male
  and female artists?

  2. How would you like the top artist entries to be highlighted? (e.g., bold colors,
  larger font size, different shading)

  3. Do you have specific preferences for the bin width or range for the histogram
  bars?

  4. Would you like the data annotations to display all song titles and points or
  only for specific songs?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the font style and size for data annotations
  and labels?

  6. Would you prefer the chart to include a legend specifically for gender color-coding?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like the significance of each highlighted
  song (year of release, artist) to be represented? (e.g., footnotes, tooltips)

  8. Would you like the distribution to be segmented by specific time intervals (e.g.,
  decade, 5-year interval)?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal bars)?

  10. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you have any preferences for
  their style or color?'
