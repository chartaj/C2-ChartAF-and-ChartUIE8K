initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing the top artists in the BBC
  Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time list. The data should display the total points
  each artist accumulated, broken down by 'n', 'n1', 'n2', 'n3', 'n4', and 'n5' categories.
  Make sure to label the axes properly with the artist names on the x-axis and the
  points on the y-axis. Color-code each category segment for better differentiation.
  The chart should clearly indicate which artists have the highest points overall
  and show the distribution across the different categories.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the category segments?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart to enhance readability, and if so, in what
  style?

  3. Is there a particular order in which you would like the artists to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by total points)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for fonts or font sizes for the axis labels
  and chart title?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotations or labels on the chart to
  highlight specific data points or artists?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to identify each category segment, and if so,
  where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. By total points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Yes, a legend should be included, preferably on the right side.
