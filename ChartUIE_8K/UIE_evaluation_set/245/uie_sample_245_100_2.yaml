initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing child labor trends over time in
  urban Britain, using the dataset provided. Use text annotations to highlight key
  data points for specific years (e.g., 1851, 1871). Employ highlights to emphasize
  changes in child labor rates. The chart should have a comparative look, displaying
  both "Child Labor in Urban Britain" and "Child Labor UK boys, historic" columns,
  thereby reflecting the social science theme and underlining the severity of child
  labor issues. Ensure the purpose and context are clear to effectively communicate
  findings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Should the text annotations for specific years (e.g., 1851, 1871) include any
  additional information beyond the year and data point value?

  3. Do you have any specific font styles or sizes in mind for the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for the highlights emphasizing changes in child
  labor rates (e.g., bold lines, color changes)?

  6. Would you like any additional context to be included in the axis labels or legends?

  7. How would you prefer the comparative look to be displayed (e.g., different color
  points for each column, different markers)?

  8. Is there a specific way you would like to handle overlapping data points on the
  scatter plot?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout or positioning of the legend?'
