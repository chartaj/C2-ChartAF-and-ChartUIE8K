initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map to visualize child labor percentages in urban
  Britain over different years, derived from the given dataset. Highlight values for
  specific years like 1851, 1861, and 1871. Use color gradients to represent child
  labor intensity, with text annotations pinpointing notable high or low percentages.
  The purpose is to illustrate the historical progression and severity of child labor.
  As this issue falls under social science, aim to inform viewers about the historical
  context and trends in child labor in the UK. Ensure the map is clear and visually
  impactful.
