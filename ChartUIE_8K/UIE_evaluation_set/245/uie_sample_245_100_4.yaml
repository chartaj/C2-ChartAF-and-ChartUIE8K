initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart visualizing child labor rates
  in urban Britain and historic child labor rates for UK boys from 1851 to 1910. Use
  different colors to distinguish between the two datasets. The x-axis should represent
  the years, and the y-axis should show the percentage of child labor. Include a legend
  to clearly indicate which color corresponds to which dataset. Title the chart "Child
  Labor in Urban Britain vs Historic Child Labor Rates for UK Boys (1851-1910)" to
  reflect the social science context. This will help to understand the trend in child
  labor over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different datasets?

  2. Would you like the y-axis to have a specific range or scale (e.g., 0-100%)?

  3. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart for easier comparison?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the title and labels?

  5. Do you wish to display data labels on the columns to show exact percentages?'
