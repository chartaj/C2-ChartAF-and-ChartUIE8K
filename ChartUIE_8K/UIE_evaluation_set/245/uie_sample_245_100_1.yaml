initial_prompt: Create a Box chart to visualize the 'Child Labor in Urban Britain'
  and 'Child Labor UK boys, historic' columns over the years from the data. Annotate
  key highlights in the data such as maximum and minimum values in both categories.
  Highlight emerging trends and significant changes over different years. Ensure the
  chart is straightforward for social-science analysis focusing on the serious issue
  of child labor. Use different shades to differentiate between the two categories
  and clearly mark the years. Provide a purpose-driven narrative using textual annotations
  to emphasize important data points and historical context.
