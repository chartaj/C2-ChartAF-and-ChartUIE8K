initial_prompt: I would like a choropleth map visualizing crop production distribution
  across Kenya based on the 2019 census data. Annotate key counties with highest and
  lowest production values for crops like maize, beans, and potatoes. Use highlights
  to emphasize these counties. The purpose is to visually identify regional differences
  in crop production. Also, include text annotations to provide context on significant
  data points and provide some orientation or editorial comments where necessary.
  This will help in understanding the agricultural landscape and focus on specific
  regions for detailed analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like specific symbols or markers used for annotations of key counties?

  3. How detailed should the text annotations be? Do you prefer short notes or more
  detailed explanations?

  4. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations and
  labels?

  5. Should the map include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  6. Do you want labels for all counties or only for those with the highest and lowest
  production values?

  7. Would you prefer if the highlights were done using borders, different colors,
  or both?

  8. Are there any specific regions or counties you want to prioritize in the visualization
  aside from relying on the data extremes?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the orientation or layout of the map (e.g., portrait,
  landscape)?

  10. Should the map include a title and/or subtitle for additional context? If yes,
  what should it be?'

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Short notes.

  5. Yes, include a legend to explain the color gradients.

  6. Only for those with the highest and lowest production values.

  7. Both borders and different colors.

  9. Landscape.

  10. Yes, include a title and subtitle for additional context. The title should be
  "Crop Production Distribution Across Kenya (2019)" and the subtitle should be "Regional
  Differences in Maize, Beans, and Potatoes Production."'
