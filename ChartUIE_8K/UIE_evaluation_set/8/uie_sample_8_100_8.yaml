initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for the 2019 Kenya Census data on crop
  production. The x-axis should represent the different counties, and the y-axis should
  indicate the total production for key crops like maize, beans, and bananas. Each
  crop should have its own line for comparison. Ensure the chart clearly distinguishes
  between counties and highlights missing data points where applicable. Utilize distinct
  colors for each crop line and include a legend for clarity. The chart should provide
  a visual summary of the agricultural distribution across Kenya's sub-counties. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors to be used for
  each crop line?

  2. What type of line style would you prefer (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  crop line?

  3. What font and size would you like for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should there be specific markers (e.g., circles, squares) at each data point
  on the lines?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines on the background for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the counties to be displayed on the
  x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by total production)?

  7. How would you like the missing data points to be represented on the chart?

  8. Would you prefer to include data labels for each point to show exact values?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and its position?

  10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or insights directly on
  the chart?'
