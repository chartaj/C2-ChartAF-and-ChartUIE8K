initial_prompt: Create a histogram showcasing the distribution of various crop productions
  across different counties in Kenya based on the 2019 census. Highlight key crops
  like maize, beans, and bananas. Annotate significant data points to focus attention
  on leading and lagging counties.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different crops in the
  histogram (e.g., maize, beans, bananas)?

  2. Would you like the histogram bars to be displayed as vertical or horizontal bars?

  3. Do you prefer specific annotations on the histogram for leading and lagging counties?
  If so, any particular format or details for these annotations?

  4. Is there a preferred sorting order for the counties (e.g., alphabetical, by production
  value)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability? If yes, do you prefer
  major grid lines, minor grid lines, or both?

  6. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  7. Are there any specific axis labels or units you want to include (e.g., ''Crop
  Production in Tonnes'')?

  8. Do you prefer to display the exact values on top of the histogram bars for crops?

  9. Would you like a legend to differentiate the crops within the histogram? If yes,
  where would you prefer the legend to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  10. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text elements in the histogram
  (title, axis labels, annotations)?'
