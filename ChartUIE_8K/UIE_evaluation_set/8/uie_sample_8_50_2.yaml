initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of crop production
  across different counties in Kenya based on the 2019 census data. Highlight key
  crops like Maize, Beans, and Bananas. Include annotations for counties with highest
  and lowest production to focus viewer's attention.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the chart, particularly for the
  different crops?

  2. Would you prefer the annotations to be represented as text boxes, arrows, or
  another form?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for easier reading of the values?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the annotations and labels?

  5. Would you like to include legends for the crops? If so, do you have any preferences
  for their placement?

  6. Should the counties be ordered in any particular way (e.g., alphabetical, by
  production volume)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific style for the stacked bars (e.g., gradient, solid
  colors)?

  8. Would you like the chart to display the exact crop production values on the bars,
  or is a visual representation sufficient?

  9. Is there a preferred title or specific wording you would like to use for the
  chart title and axis labels?

  10. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or references directly
  on the chart?'
