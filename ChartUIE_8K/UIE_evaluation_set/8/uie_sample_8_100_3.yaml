initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the crop production distribution across
  different counties in Kenya based on the 2019 census data. Include categories such
  as Maize, Sorghum, Rice, Potatoes, Beans, and Cassava. Use color intensity to represent
  the production volume. This will help identify regions with higher or lower agricultural
  outputs. Ensure missing data is handled appropriately to avoid inaccuracies. The
  focus is on farming and crop production while providing a comparative visual representation
  of different crops in each county.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?


  2. Do you prefer a specific range of color intensity for the production volume?


  3. Would you like to include labels for each county on the heatmap?


  4. Is there a specific way you would like the missing data to be displayed or handled?


  5. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?


  6. Do you want a legend to indicate the production volume corresponding to the color
  intensity?


  7. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap
  to highlight certain regions or crops?


  8. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the heatmap?


  9. Would you like county borders or boundaries to be outlined on the heatmap?


  10. Are there any additional crops or categories you would like to include apart
  from Maize, Sorghum, Rice, Potatoes, Beans, and Cassava?'
