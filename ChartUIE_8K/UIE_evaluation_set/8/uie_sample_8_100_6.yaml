initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the crop production
  distribution in Kenya from the 2019 census. The chart should include crops such
  as Maize, Sorghum, Rice, Potatoes, Beans, Cassava, and Sweet Potatoes. Group the
  data by County or Sub-County and display the production volume for each crop. This
  should help compare the production levels across different regions effectively.
  Ensure the chart is clear and includes all necessary labels for easy interpretation.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like the counties or sub-counties to be sorted in any particular order
  (e.g., alphabetically, by production volume)?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of values?

  4. Do you want to display the exact production values on top of each bar?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and title?

  6. Would you like a legend to differentiate between the different crops?

  7. Should the chart include any specific annotations or highlights (e.g., highest
  production, specific counties)?

  8. Do you want the chart to have a title? If so, do you have a preference for the
  title text?

  9. Is there any additional context or information you want to include in the chart
  (e.g., total production summary, average production per region)?

  10. Do you have a preference for the axis labels format (e.g., horizontal, vertical,
  angled)?

  11. Would you like any specific margins or padding around the chart elements?'
