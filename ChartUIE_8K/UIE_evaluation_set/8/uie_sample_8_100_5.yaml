initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart illustrating the distribution of crop production
  in Kenya according to the 2019 census. The chart should showcase various crops such
  as maize, sorghum, rice, potatoes, beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, and wheat. Each
  bar will represent a different crop, and the height of the bars will reflect the
  total production amounts. This visualization will help in understanding the agricultural
  output across different crops in Kenya. Use the available data for accurate representation,
  and ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret for stakeholders interested
  in agricultural trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like each bar to be labeled with its respective value?

  3. Do you require grid lines to be included on the chart for easier comparison?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the crops to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by production amount)?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels, and if so, do you have a preference
  for the wording?

  6. Do you want any additional annotations or highlights on specific bars or data
  points?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included on the chart, or is it unnecessary given
  that each bar represents a different crop?

  8. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the bars?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to be used in the
  chart?'
