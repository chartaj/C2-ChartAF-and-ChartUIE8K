initial_prompt: Could you create a scatter plot for me using the data from the provided
  CSV? I want to see the relationships between columns 'x', 'y1', and 'y2'. Please
  plot 'x' on the X-axis and both 'y1' and 'y2' on the Y-axis, using different colors
  for 'y1' and 'y2'. It's important to include labels for each axis and a legend to
  distinguish between 'y1' and 'y2'. This visualization is for a data science analytics
  project, so clarity and accuracy are crucial. Thanks!
