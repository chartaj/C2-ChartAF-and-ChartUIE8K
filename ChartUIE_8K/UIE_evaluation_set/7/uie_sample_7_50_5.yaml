initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing global meat production by country.
  Use the 'Country', 'Code', 'Year', and 'Meat, total | Production | tonnes' columns.
  Highlight production differences in 1961, as detailed in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the map include labels for each country with their meat production values?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradient representing
  meat production levels?

  4. Do you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Should the map emphasize any particular regions or countries?

  6. Do you want to include annotations or callouts for countries with extreme values
  or significant production levels?

  7. Are there any specific stylistic elements you would like to see, such as borders
  around countries or background grids?

  8. Do you have a preferred level of data granularity (e.g., by country, by continent)?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like to handle countries with missing data
  or zero meat production?'
