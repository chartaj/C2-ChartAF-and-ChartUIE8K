initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the dataset from "12.csv". Focus
  on the distribution of psychological scores (O_score, C_score, E_score, A_score,
  N_score) and aptitudes (Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Perceptual Aptitude,
  Abstract Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning). Each box should represent one of these columns
  to show medians, quartiles, and potential outliers. This chart should help us understand
  the variability and central tendency in scores and aptitudes for predicting career
  paths effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels on the boxes (e.g., min, max,
  median)?

  by aptitude)?

  to specific parts of the chart?

  6. Do you have specific dimensions or aspect ratios in mind for the chart?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to use for the chart?

  8. Do you want legends or a brief description of each score and aptitude included
  in the chart?

  9. Should we use a particular font style or size for the chart''s text elements
  (axes labels, title, etc.)?
