initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the relationships between the
  personality scores (O_score, C_score, E_score, A_score, N_score) and various aptitude
  scores (Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Perceptual Aptitude, Abstract Reasoning,
  Verbal Reasoning) from the provided dataset. Ensure the heatmap clearly indicates
  the strength of correlations between these different attributes to better understand
  the psychological profiles and their impact on career choices. Use appropriate color
  gradients to distinguish between high and low correlations. Include labels for the
  axes and a color legend to interpret the data accurately.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for distinguishing between high
  and low correlations?

  2. Would you like specific color codes for the highest and lowest correlations?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style of the axis labels?

  4. Would you like to include any specific titles or annotations on the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you would like to highlight in the
  heatmap?

  7. Should the color legend be placed in a specific location or follow any specific
  format?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the overall size or dimensions of the heatmap?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical metrics or data points included in
  the heatmap?

  10. Are there any specific color-blind friendly palettes you would prefer to use?'
