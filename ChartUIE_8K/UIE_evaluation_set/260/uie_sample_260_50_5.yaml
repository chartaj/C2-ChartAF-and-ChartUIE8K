initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the discovery methods of exoplanets
  with their corresponding orbital periods from the provided data. Group by `pl_discmethod`
  and use `pl_orbper` for the stacks. Add labels for `pl_hostname`.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different discovery methods?

  2. Do you want the bars to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., ascending or
  descending orbital periods)?

  3. Should the stacked bar chart have a legend indicating the meaning of each stack?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or styles you want for the labels of the `pl_hostname`?

  5. Do you prefer the y-axis to display count, sum, or average of `pl_orbper` values?

  6. How many decimal places should be shown for the orbital periods (`pl_orbper`)?

  7. Do you want gridlines enabled or disabled in the chart background?

  8. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so, what should they be?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you want for the chart?

  10. Would you like to add any annotations or comments directly on the chart to highlight
  specific points?'
