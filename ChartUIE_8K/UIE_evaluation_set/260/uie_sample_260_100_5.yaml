initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the discovery methods and count
  of exoplanets discovered using each method from the Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries.
  Use different colors for each method. Additionally, represent the average orbital
  period (pl_orbper) as an overlay on the same chart using line markers. Make sure
  the x-axis shows the discovery methods, and the y-axis shows the count of exoplanets.
  For the second y-axis, show the average orbital period. Label each method and ensure
  all values are clearly visible for quick analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different discovery
  methods?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to denote the colors for different discovery
  methods?

  3. Do you prefer the line markers for the average orbital period to be in a specific
  style (e.g., dashed, solid, dotted)?

  4. Would you like data labels to be shown on the bars and line markers?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to highlight on
  the chart?

  8. Do you prefer any particular ordering for the discovery methods on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical, by count)?

  9. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  10. Do you have a preference for the thickness or style of the bars and line markers?'
