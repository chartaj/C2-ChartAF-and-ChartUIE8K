initial_prompt: Create a dot plot of exoplanet orbital periods from Kepler discoveries,
  highlighting Radial Velocity detected planets. Annotate key planets with highest
  masses and extreme orbital periods. Highlight stars' distances to show proximity.
  Include temperature ranges of stars in tooltips for added context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme or color palettes used
  for highlighting Radial Velocity detected planets?

  2. Should the annotations for key planets with highest masses and extreme orbital
  periods be displayed in a specific format or style?

  3. Do you prefer a specific shape or size for the dots representing the exoplanets?

  4. Would you like the stars'' distances to be represented using a particular type
  of marker or highlighting method?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type and size used in the annotations
  and tooltips?

  6. Should the dot plot include gridlines or other visual guides to help interpret
  the data?

  7. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the dot plot?

  8. How would you like the temperature ranges of stars to be represented in the tooltips
  (e.g., in Kelvin, Celsius)?

  9. Do you have a preference for the axis labels and titles style or format?

  10. Should we include a legend to explain the highlighted features, and do you have
  a preference for its position or format?'
