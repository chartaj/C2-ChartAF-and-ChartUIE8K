initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing Kepler Telescope Exoplanet
  Discoveries. Use 'pl_hostname' on the x-axis, grouped by 'pl_letter', showing their
  'pl_orbper' and 'pl_bmassj' values. Ensure error bars are displayed for 'pl_orbpererr1'
  and 'pl_bmassjerr1'. Include distinct colors for each planet letter group and label
  axes appropriately. Include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct colors representing
  each planet letter group?

  2. What specific labels would you like on the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like to include specific titles for the chart and legend?

  4. Should the error bars for ''pl_orbper'' and ''pl_bmassj'' represent one standard
  deviation, standard error, or custom confidence intervals?

  5. Is there a preferred order for the ''pl_hostname'' on the x-axis?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the formatting of the legend (e.g.,
  position, spacing, border)?

  8. Should the chart grid lines be displayed or hidden?

  9. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed with a specific width or spacing between
  groups?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or specific data points you would like
  to highlight?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. X-axis should be labeled "Planet Hostname", and y-axis should be labeled "Measured
  Values".

  3. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a preferred order for the ''pl_hostname'' on the x-axis.

  6. I am not sure about the font styles or sizes.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for the legend formatting.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure about bar width or spacing between groups.
