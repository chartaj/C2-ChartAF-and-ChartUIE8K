initial_prompt: 'Please create a bar chart visualizing the number of exoplanet discoveries
  by the detection method. Use the data from the "pl_discmethod" column to categorize
  the methods and the "pl_hostname" column to count the total discoveries for each
  method. Ensure the chart clearly depicts each detection method on the x-axis and
  the number of discoveries on the y-axis. Title the chart appropriately to reflect
  the data context: "Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries by Detection Method."
  Include distinct colors for each bar to differentiate the methods. This will help
  analyze the most effective detection methods.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the bars in the chart?

  2. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the chart title and
  labels?

  3. Would you like to include any specific gridlines or tick marks on the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  4. Do you have a particular layout or style for displaying the legend?

  5. Should the bars be displayed in a particular order (e.g., ascending or descending
  by the number of discoveries)?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or data labels directly on the bars?

  7. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the chart?'
