initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Kepler telescope exoplanet discoveries.
  Plot the orbital period vs. orbital semi-major axis. Use text annotations to highlight
  planets with the longest and shortest orbital periods. Include highlights to emphasize
  planets discovered via radial velocity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed (font size, color,
  etc.)?

  3. Should the highlights for planets discovered via radial velocity be represented
  as different shapes, colors, or both?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the scatter plot?

  5. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart?

  6. Should the axes be in log scale or linear scale?

  7. Do you prefer the data points to have a specific marker size?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate discovery methods?

  9. Do you have any specific title for the scatter plot and the axes labels?

  10. Should any specific planets other than those with the longest and shortest orbital
  periods be annotated or highlighted?'
