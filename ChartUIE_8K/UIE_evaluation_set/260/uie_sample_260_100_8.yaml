initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the discovery methods used for
  exoplanets from the provided dataset. The chart should show the proportion of each
  discovery method based on the 'pl_discmethod' column. This will help us understand
  which methods are most frequently used in detecting exoplanets. Make sure each slice
  is labeled with the method name and percentage of occurrence. Given the context
  of Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries, this visualization will be crucial for
  further analysis in space and astronomy projects. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Should the chart title include any specific wording or phrasing?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and title?

  4. Would you like the chart legend to be displayed, and if so, where should it be
  positioned?

  5. Is there a specific order you prefer for the slices, such as alphabetical or
  descending by proportion?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the slicing effect, like whether slices should
  be separated to emphasize certain methods?

  7. Should there be any specific emphasis or highlighting on particular discovery
  methods in the chart?

  8. Do you have any requirements for the background color or border of the chart?

  9. Is there any additional text or annotation you''d like to include on the pie
  chart?'
