initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing Kepler telescope exoplanet discoveries,
  highlighting the orbital period (pl_orbper) against semi-major axis (pl_orbsmax)
  for different planets. Use different colors or sizes to distinguish between discovery
  methods (pl_discmethod). Annotate notable exoplanets with their host star names
  (pl_hostname). Ensure the plot clearly indicates the relationship between these
  variables and emphasizes the diversity of exoplanet discoveries. Include relevant
  highlights and annotations to draw attention to key data points, making the visual
  more informative and engaging for understanding exoplanet characteristics.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to distinguish between
  discovery methods?

  2. What size attributes would you prefer for different discovery methods (e.g.,
  all the same size, varying sizes)?

  3. Should the notable exoplanets with their host star names have a specific annotation
  style (e.g., font size, color, label positioning)?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  5. Do you want axis labels and title to follow a specific format or style?

  6. Are there any specific planets or host stars you want to ensure are highlighted?

  7. Do you have any preference for the legend''s placement on the plot?

  8. Should the plot include error bars for the orbital period and semi-major axis?

  9. Do you have any preference for the background color of the plot?

  10. Would you like a specific style or theme for the plot (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  scientific)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Varying sizes would be good.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have specific planets or host stars in mind, but notable ones should
  be highlighted.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have a preference for the background color.

  10. A scientific theme would be preferred.'
