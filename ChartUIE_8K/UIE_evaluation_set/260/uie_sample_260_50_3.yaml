initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing the number of exoplanets discovered
  via each discovery method ("pl_discmethod"), categorized by the number of planets
  per host star ("pl_pnum"). Use different colors for each discovery method.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for different
  discovery methods?

  2. Should the y-axis represent the exact number of exoplanets, or would you like

  3. Do you prefer a particular order for the categories of the number of planets
  per host star on the x-axis (e.g., ascending, descending)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If so, should they be
  in the background or foreground?

  5. Do you have any specific labeling preferences for the axes (e.g., font size,
