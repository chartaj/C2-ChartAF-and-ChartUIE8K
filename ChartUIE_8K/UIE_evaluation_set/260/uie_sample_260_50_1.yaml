initial_prompt: Create a Heatmap to visualize the orbital periods of planets discovered
  by the Kepler telescope. Highlight planets with radial velocity method. Include
  text annotations for the top three longest and shortest orbital periods to focus
  viewer attention. This visualization supports space and astronomy research.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preference for the color used to highlight planets discovered using
  the radial velocity method?

  3. What style do you prefer for text annotations (e.g., font size, color, bold,
  italic)?

  4. Do you want grid lines displayed on the heatmap?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to include a legend that explains the color intensity
  related to orbital periods?

  6. Do you prefer a specific range or scaling method for the color intensity of the
  heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include axis labels or titles for the heatmap? If so, what
  should they be?

  8. Do you have a preference for the shape and size of the heatmap cells?

  9. Would you like tooltips to appear with additional information when hovering over
  each cell in the heatmap?

  10. Are there any specific labels or markers you would like to include to enhance
  the visibility of key data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer bold text for the annotations.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, include a legend to explain the color intensity related to orbital periods.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include axis labels. They should be "Planet Index" for the x-axis
  and "Orbital Period (days)" for the y-axis.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
