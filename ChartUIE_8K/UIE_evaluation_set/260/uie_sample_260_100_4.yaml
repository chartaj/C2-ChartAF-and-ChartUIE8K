initial_prompt: I would like a column chart visualizing the Kepler Telescope Exoplanet
  Discoveries. Specifically, show the number of discovered exoplanets per discovery
  method ('pl_discmethod'). Each discovery method should have its own column bar indicating
  the count of exoplanets found. Moreover, include labels for each discovery method
  and a legend. The x-axis should represent the discovery methods while the y-axis
  should indicate the number of exoplanets found using each method. Ensure the chart
  is clear and well-labeled for easy interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the column bars
  representing different discovery methods?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included for easier interpretation?

  3. Do you prefer the legend to be placed at a specific position on the chart (top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact count of exoplanets on
  top of each column bar?

  6. Is there any specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Would you prefer the x-axis labels (discovery methods) to be rotated or angled
  for better readability?

  8. Do you have any specific margin or padding preferences for the chart elements?'
