initial_prompt: Visualize the provided data using a box chart to effectively highlight
  the distribution and variability of 'x' and 'y'. Ensure to include data-driven text
  annotations to display the specific values at key points within the box chart. These
  annotations will draw attention to critical data points and provide context, emphasizing
  their importance. Moreover, use highlights to modify the appearance of the chart
  elements, thereby distinguishing significant data points and making them stand out
  visually. This visualization will serve the practical purpose of providing a clear
  and focused analysis of the data trends and outliers within the dataset.

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the display of whiskers and outlier markers
  in the box chart?

  8. Should the chart include a title or any specific labels for the axes?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  10. Are legends or additional context information needed in the chart to distinguish
  between ''x'' and ''y''?'
