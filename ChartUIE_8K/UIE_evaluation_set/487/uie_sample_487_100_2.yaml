initial_prompt: Please create a detailed line chart using the data provided. The chart
  should plot 'x' on the x-axis and 'y' on the y-axis. Display the unique values prominently,
  highlighting any significant trends. Utilize text annotations to point out key data
  points that will help focus the viewer's attention. Additionally, consider using
  highlights to emphasize important segments of the line for better visualization.
  This will be helpful for in-depth data science and analytics tasks by making it
  easier to understand and interpret the numerical relationships and trends in the
  dataset. Thank you!
