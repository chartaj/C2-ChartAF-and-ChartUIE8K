initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the changes in planetary mass over
  discovery years from the exoplanet data. Highlight the discovery method to differentiate
  the planets. Use annotations to mark significant discoveries, like those in 2012
  and 2016, for extra context. Make sure to emphasize planets on the "Confirmed planets"
  list. The chart should help understand trends and options RD and transit methods'
  effectiveness over time and the subsequent growth in identified planetary masses.
  This should give insights into how discovery technologies have evolved and impacted
  our knowledge of exoplanets.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating discovery
  methods in the line chart?

  2. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the annotations marking
  significant discoveries?

  3. Would you like any specific line styles (e.g., dashed, solid) to be used for
  different discovery methods?

  4. Is there a preferred marker style (e.g., circles, squares) for the data points
  representing the planets?

  5. Do you have a preference for the background color or gridline style of the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different discovery methods,
  and where would you prefer it to be placed? (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)

  7. How would you like to visually emphasize the "Confirmed planets" list (e.g.,
  using a specific color, thicker line)?

  8. Do you require a title or subtitle for the chart? If so, please specify the text.

  9. Would you like any specific axis labels or formatting (e.g., bold, italic) for
  the x-axis (Discovery Year) and y-axis (Planetary Mass)?

  10. Are there any additional data points or events, apart from 2012 and 2016, that
  you would like to highlight with annotations?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I prefer it to be placed at the top-right.

  7. Use a specific color and thicker line to emphasize the "Confirmed planets" list.

  8. Yes, the title should be "Trends in Planetary Mass Discoveries (2000-2023)" and
  the subtitle "Effectiveness of RD and Transit Methods".

  9. X-axis label: "Discovery Year", Y-axis label: "Planetary Mass (Jupiter Mass)".

  10. I am not sure.'
