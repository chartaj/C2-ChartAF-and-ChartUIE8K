initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between SemiMajorAxisAU
  and PeriodDays. Highlight confirmed planets distinctly. Include text annotations
  for outliers in terms of extreme values. Use color to differentiate between different
  discovery methods. This is for the Open Exoplanet Catalogue.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating discovery
  methods?

  2. How would you prefer to see the confirmed planets highlighted (e.g., different
  marker shapes, sizes, or border styles)?

  3. Do you have any preferred formats for text annotations for outliers (e.g., font
  size, color, or placement)?

  4. Would you prefer gridlines or axis ticks for better readability, and if so, in
  what style?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart background (e.g., color, transparency)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend in the chart, and if yes, where would you
  prefer it to be placed?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the axes and the overall
  chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?

  9. Would you like to apply any specific scaling (e.g., logarithmic) to the axes
  to better visualize the data?'
