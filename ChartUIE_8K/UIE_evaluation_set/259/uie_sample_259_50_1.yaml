initial_prompt: Create a line chart of exoplanets' discovery years vs. planetary mass.
  Highlight exoplanets discovered through different methods. Annotate key data points,
  especially peculiar cases.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting different

  and symbols used?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want for the axes (e.g., particular
  years, planetary mass range)?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If yes, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  8. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  9. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels'' wording or format?
