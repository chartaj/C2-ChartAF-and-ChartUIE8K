initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of planets discovered per
  year from the dataset. Highlight bars for years with exceptionally high discoveries.
  Annotate specific years like 2016 and 2012, noting example discoveries such as HD
  143761 b, HD 143761 c, and KOI-1843.03. Reflect on the discovery methods (RV, transit)
  and their impact on discovery rates. Utilize the Open Exoplanet Catalogue data to
  show the distribution and trends in exoplanet discoveries, emphasizing the importance
  of these years in space-and-astronomy research.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like a specific font style or size for annotations?

  3. How would you prefer the bars to be highlighted for exceptionally high discoveries
  (e.g., different color, pattern)?

  4. Do you have a specific format or style for annotating the specific years (2016
  and 2012)?

  5. Is there a preferred orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend for discovery methods (RV, transit)?

  7. How detailed should the annotations be for the examples of planet discoveries?

  8. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Do you have any preference for the axis labels or titles on the chart?

  10. Should the chart include any additional information or context about the discovery
  methods'' impact on the discovery rates?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Different color would be preferred.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Vertical.

  6. Yes, please include a legend for discovery methods.

  7. Not too detailed, just the names of example discoveries.

  8. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  9. I do not have a specific preference.

  10. Yes, please include information on the impact of discovery methods on the discovery
  rates.'
