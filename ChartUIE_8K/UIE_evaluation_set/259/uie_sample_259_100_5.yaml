initial_prompt: I want to visualize the exoplanet data from the Open Exoplanet Catalogue
  using a Treemap chart. The Treemap should represent the distribution of planets
  discovered by different methods and their discovery years. Each tile in the Treemap
  should display the planet's name, type, mass, and radius. Size the tiles by planetary
  mass and color them by discovery method. Also, highlight the planets within the
  'Confirmed planets' list. This visualization should help in understanding the variety
  and discovery trends of exoplanets in the catalogue.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating discovery
  methods?

  2. How would you like the ''Confirmed planets'' to be highlighted (e.g., specific
  color, border, etc.)?

  3. Should the size of the tiles be directly proportional to the planetary mass or
  should a logarithmic scale be used?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the planet''s name,
  type, mass, and radius labels within each tile?

  5. Do you want any additional information or tooltips when hovering over each tile?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout orientation for the Treemap (e.g., vertical or
  horizontal)?

  7. Would you like to include any legends or a key for understanding the color-coding
  and tile sizes?

  8. Are there any specific years or discovery methods you would like to focus on
  or emphasize in the Treemap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I would prefer the ''Confirmed planets'' to be highlighted with a specific border.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a preference for fonts or font sizes.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, please include legends or a key for understanding the color-coding and tile
  sizes.

  8. I am not sure about focusing on specific years or discovery methods.'
