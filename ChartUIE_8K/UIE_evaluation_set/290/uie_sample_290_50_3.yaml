initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the unique values for each column
  in the bird collisions dataset, particularly focusing on genus, species, locality,
  and family distributions. Use different colors for each category to highlight the
  differences. This will help understand the species diversity and collision frequency
  in different localities and families.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different categories
  in the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  3. Do you want a legend to distinguish between the different categories? If so,
  where should it be placed?

  4. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like for the chart?

  5. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  6. Are there any specific margins or spacings that you would like to be adjusted
  for better readability?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better reference?

  8. Should there be any specific sorting order for the categories (e.g., ascending,
  descending)?

  9. Do you want to highlight any particular category or value in the chart?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  chart?'
