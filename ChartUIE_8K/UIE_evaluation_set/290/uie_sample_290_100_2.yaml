initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the frequency of bird collisions by
  date. Annotate the peaks with text annotations highlighting the highest collision
  dates. Use shape annotations like arrows to mark significant dates related to the
  bird species' annual migration patterns. Highlight the family 'Passerellidae' and
  habitat 'Open' to demonstrate the impact of habitat on collision frequency. This
  visualization will help in understanding the temporal patterns in bird collisions
  and the influence of habitat, which is crucial for zoological studies and developing
  collision mitigation strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, font
  style, text color)?

  3. Do you have specific dates that you consider significant for the migration patterns
  that should be marked with arrows?

  4. What color would you prefer for highlighting the ''Passerellidae'' family?

  5. How would you like the ''Open'' habitat to be highlighted in the histogram (e.g.,
  specific pattern or shading)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the histogram for better readability?

  7. Do you have any preference for the axis labels and title fonts and sizes?

  8. Should the histogram include a legend for the highlighted features?

  9. Is there a specific time interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) you prefer for
  the date axis?

  10. Do you prefer any boundary lines or markers for peak annotations, aside from
  text?'
