initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize bird collisions data focusing on
  genus and species over different dates. Highlight each genus with a different color.
  Add text annotations for key species to emphasize commonly affected ones. Use shape
  annotations to enclose data points within specified habitat types to show trends.
  The visualization should aid in understanding the impact of habitat and family on
  bird collisions over time. Include axes for genus and date, and provide a legend
  for species. This will help in identifying patterns and potential causes in bird
  collision incidents in zoology studies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different genera?

  2. Which key species would you like to have text annotations for?

  3. Do you have preferences for the shapes used in shape annotations to denote different
  habitat types?

  4. Would you prefer the genus names to be displayed on the x-axis or the y-axis?

  5. Do you have specific formatting preferences for the date axis (e.g., month/year
  format)?

  6. How detailed do you want the legend for species to be?

  7. Are there any specific patterns or trends you are particularly interested in
  highlighting?

  8. Would you like any particular styles for the text annotations (e.g., font size,
  color)?

  9. Do you want grid lines or background shading in the scatter plot for better readability?

  10. Are there any particular outliers or exceptions that you are aware of and would
  like explicitly marked?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Northern Cardinal, American Robin, and Cedar Waxwing.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Genus names on the x-axis.

  5. Month/year format would be good.

  6. I would like the legend for species to be detailed but clear.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No specific preference for text annotations.

  9. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  10. I do not know.'
