initial_prompt: I have a dataset about bird collisions observed over time, including
  genus, species, date, locality, family, flight call, habitat, and stratum. I want
  to create a stacked column chart. The x-axis will be the "date" with yearly intervals,
  and the y-axis will be the "frequency" of collisions. The stacks will represent
  different "family" categories, showing the number of collisions per family each
  year. This will help visualize how bird collisions vary over time and by family
  group. Please provide a colorful, clear chart that can be interpreted easily for
  analysis in zoological studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for each "family" in the
  stack?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability?

  3. Should the x-axis labels be rotated for better visibility?

  4. Do you want the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  5. Should data labels with collision frequencies be displayed on each stack segment?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the titles, labels,
  and legends?

  7. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please
  provide the text.

  8. Do you want any annotations or highlights for specific years or events?

  9. Should the chart have a border or specific design elements to align with your
  publication standards?

  10. Is there a preference for the order of "family" categories in the stack (e.g.,
  alphabetical, size of collisions, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for colors.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure where it should be positioned.

  5. Yes, display data labels with collision frequencies on each stack segment.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, title: "Annual Bird Collisions by Family," subtitle: "Observed Frequency
  of Collisions Over Time."

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. No specific preference.'
