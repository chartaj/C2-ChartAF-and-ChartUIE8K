initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the "Access to Computers From Home OECD"
  dataset. The heatmap should display the availability of home computers over time
  across different locations. On the x-axis, represent the 'TIME' (years), and on
  the y-axis, represent the 'LOCATION' (countries). The intensity/color of the heatmap
  cells should represent the 'Value' which is the percentage of households with computers.
  Ensure to handle any missing values appropriately. The heatmap should make it easy
  to compare computer access trends across different countries over the years. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color intensity?

  3. Do you have any specific range or scale for the color intensity?

  4. Should we include labels for the x-axis (years) and y-axis (countries)?

  5. How would you like missing values to be handled (e.g., leave blank, use a specific
  color, interpolate)?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should gridlines or borders be included in the heatmap cells?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or text within the heatmap cells?

  9. Do you prefer a specific orientation or layout for the heatmap (e.g., square
  cells, rectangular cells)?

  10. Are there any specific countries or years you would like to highlight or focus
  on?'
