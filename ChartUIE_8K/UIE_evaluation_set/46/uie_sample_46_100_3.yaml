initial_prompt: I have CSV data about computer access from home by country over different
  years. Can you create a bar chart showing the percentage of households with computers
  for Denmark from 2006 to 2008? I want the x-axis to represent the years and the
  y-axis to show the percentage of households (Value). Make sure to label the axes
  appropriately and add a title to the chart. Itâ€™s from the Access to Computers From
  Home OECD dataset. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier comparison?

  3. Should the bars be displayed in a specific style (e.g., solid, striped)?

  4. Do you want to include any specific annotations or data labels on the bars?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  6. Do you prefer the bars to be spaced in a particular way?

  7. Would you like to display the exact percentage values on top of each bar?

  8. Is there a particular way you want the y-axis scale to be set (e.g., increments
  of 5, 10)?

  9. Do you need a legend for the chart, or is it unnecessary since only Denmark''s
  data is shown?'
