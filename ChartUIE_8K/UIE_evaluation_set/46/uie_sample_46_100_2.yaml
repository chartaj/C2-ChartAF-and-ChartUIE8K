initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the percentage of households in Denmark
  with access to computers from 2006 to 2020. The x-axis should represent the TIME
  (years), and the y-axis should reflect the Value (percentage). Highlight significant
  trends and any sudden changes. Use text annotations to indicate key values or years
  where the percentage markedly increased or decreased. The chart should clearly show
  the progression over time, focusing viewers' attention on years with notable differences.
  Add context annotations to provide relevant editorial comments or explanations for
  high or low values in specific years.
