initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot that visualizes the "Access to Computers From
  Home" data. Plot the TIME on the x-axis and the Value on the y-axis to show changes
  over years for Denmark. Add text annotations to highlight notable years and values,
  particularly focusing on peaks and troughs. Use highlights to visually distinguish
  significant data points, perhaps by changing their color or size. This scatter plot
  will help in understanding trends in computer access over time and emphasize critical
  data points. Include context from the data details to make the chart informative
  and engaging.
