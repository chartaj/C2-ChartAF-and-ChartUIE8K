initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization of the data showing the percentage
  of households with access to computers at home across different years for Denmark.
  Use vivid colors to differentiate between years and display data-driven text annotations
  for the years with the highest and lowest values. Highlight these specific years
  to emphasize the variation over time. Contextualize the chart with a title and a
  brief description to maintain focus on trends in home computer accessibility in
  Denmark, as part of an OECD study on computers and technology.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or palette in mind for differentiating
  between the years?

  2. Are there any specific font preferences or sizes for the annotations?

  3. Would you like the years with the highest and lowest values to be highlighted
  using a specific color or graphic element?

  4. Is there a preferred title or any specific wording you would like for the chart
  description?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or aspect ratio of the Treemap?

  6. Should the description include any additional context or statistical insights
  beyond the data trend itself?'
