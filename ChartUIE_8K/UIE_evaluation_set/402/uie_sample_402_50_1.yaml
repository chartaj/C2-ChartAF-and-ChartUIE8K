  regions.

  density variations?

  2. Are there particular font styles or sizes you would like used for annotated values?

  4. Do you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) for the heatmap?

  5. Would you like boundary lines for countries to be emphasized or subtle?

  6. Should there be a title or subtitle on the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  7. Do you require any additional labels or annotations besides the specified countries?
