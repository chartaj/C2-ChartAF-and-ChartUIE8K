initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the population of countries. Use annotations
  to highlight the countries with the highest and lowest populations. Make the colors
  more vibrant for regions with larger populations to draw attention. The purpose
  is to understand population distribution visually.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the treemap?\n\
  2. How would you like the annotations to be displayed? \n3. Do you have specific\
  \ font preferences for labels and annotations?\n4. How would you like regions with\
  \ larger populations to be colored to draw attention?\n5. Do you prefer the size\
  \ of the treemap sections to reflect the population size proportionally?\n6. Should\
  \ each region be labeled with the country name and population, or just the country\
  \ name?\n7. Do you want a legend to explain the color shades indicating different\
  \ population levels?\n8. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to\
  \ make sure are highlighted besides the highest and lowest populations?"
