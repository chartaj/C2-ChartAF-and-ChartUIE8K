initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the population densities of countries
  from the provided dataset. Use country names and population data; ensure to show
  intensity variations based on population figures.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?\n2. Should the\
  \ heatmap include annotations for population figures directly on the map?\n3. Would\
  \ you like to have a legend or key to explain the intensity variations?\n4. Do you\
  \ want specific countries to be highlighted or focused on?\n5. Should the heatmap\
  \ display country names on the map itself, or would you prefer a tooltip that shows\
  \ the name and population when hovered over?\n6. Would you like to include any geographical\
  \ boundaries or just the heatmap by itself?\n7. Are there any additional labels\
  \ or titles you would like to include in the visualization? \n8. Should the heatmap\
  \ support zooming in and out to view specific regions more clearly?"
