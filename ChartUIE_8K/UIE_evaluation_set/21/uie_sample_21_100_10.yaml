initial_prompt: I need a histogram that visualizes the distribution of `meanfreq`
  values for male and female voices from the Gender Recognition by Voice dataset.
  Please group the data into bins of equal width to see any notable differences between
  the two genders. Highlight the mean and median `meanfreq` values for each gender
  with different colors or markers. Make sure the axes are labeled clearly, and include
  a legend to distinguish between the male and female data points. The title should
  reflect the comparison of `meanfreq` distribution by gender.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  male and female data?

  2. What colors or markers would you like to use to highlight the mean and median
  `meanfreq` values for each gender?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Is there a specific number of bins or bin width you prefer for the histogram?

  5. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred position for the legend on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the legend (e.g., font size,
  style)?

  8. Should the chart have a grid background or remain plain?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure; maybe something that stands out, like red for mean and blue for
  median?

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know the specific number of bins.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure, maybe on the right side?

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not know.'
