initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing mean frequency, standard deviation,
  and median values from male voices data. Highlight the meanfun metric as it indicates
  vocal pitch. Add text annotations for meanfun peaks to emphasize higher pitch areas
  for deeper analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing between the different
  data attributes like ''meanfreq'', ''sd'', ''median'', and ''meanfun''?

  2. Do you have a preferred style for the line chart (e.g., solid lines, dashed lines,
  line thickness)?

  3. Where would you like the text annotations for ''meanfun'' peaks to be placed
  (e.g., above the peak, below the peak)?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which line represents each data
  attribute?

  6. Are there any specific titles, subtitles, or labels you would like to see added
  to the chart?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines to be shown or hidden in the background of the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred background color for the chart?

  9. Should the axes be in a specific format (e.g., logarithmic, linear), or is the
  default acceptable?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the x-axis and y-axis?'
