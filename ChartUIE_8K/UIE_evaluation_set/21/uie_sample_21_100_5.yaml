initial_prompt: Create a violin plot using the dataset "Gender Recognition by Voice"
  to visualize the distribution of 'meanfun' (mean fundamental frequency) for male
  and female voice samples. On the x-axis, display the gender labels ('male' and 'female'),
  and on the y-axis, display the 'meanfun' values. Use different colors to distinguish
  between male and female distributions within the plot. This visualization will help
  in understanding how the mean fundamental frequency varies between male and female
  voices.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  male and female distributions?

  2. Do you prefer to include any additional annotations or labels on the plot?

  3. Would you like to adjust the width of the violins to better represent the density
  of data points?

  4. Should the violins be split to show quartile information or remain as smoothed
  distributions?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the style or design of the plot, such as the
  background grid or axis lines?

  6. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for labels and titles on the
  plot?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would like the plot to be?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like to adjust the width of the violins to better represent the
  density of data points.

  4. I am not sure.
