initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that visualizes the 'meanfreq', 'sd',
  'median', 'Q25', 'Q75', and 'IQR' columns from the Gender Recognition by Voice dataset.
  Include data-driven text annotations to highlight key values for the 'meanfreq',
  'median', and 'Q75' columns. Additionally, use highlights to emphasize male and
  female data points for clear gender comparison. The primary purpose is to provide
  an insightful visual comparison of voice feature statistics by gender. This can
  help uncover noticeable patterns or differences between male and female voices.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  male and female data points?

  2. Should the chart include a legend explaining the colors used for male and female
  data points?

  3. Do you have specific preferences for the text annotations, such as font size
  or style?

  4. Do you prefer the text annotations to be placed at a particular position relative
  to the highlighted data points?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability,
  and if so, should they be of a specific style or color?

  6. Should the chart include axis titles, and do you have any preferences for their
  labels?

  7. Do you have a preferred method for emphasizing the key values (''meanfreq'',
  ''median'', ''Q75''), such as bold text, different colors, or data labels?'
