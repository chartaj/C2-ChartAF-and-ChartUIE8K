initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the "meanfun" (mean fundamental
  frequency) of voices from the dataset. The x-axis should represent individual samples,
  and the y-axis should show the "meanfun" values. Highlight the trend by annotating
  the highest and lowest points with their respective values. This visualization will
  help us understand the variation in mean fundamental frequency in male voices. The
  chart should make it easy to identify patterns, trends, and outliers in the data,
  which could be crucial for arts and entertainment applications.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the line
  chart?

  2. Would you prefer any specific style or format for the annotations of the highest
  and lowest points?

  3. How do you wish the x-axis (individual samples) to be labeled, given that data
  points might be numerous?

  4. Do you have a preference for the thickness and style of the trend line (e.g.,
  solid, dashed)?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, how should
  they be styled?

  6. Are there any specific font preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to include a legend in the chart, even if it''s just one data
  attribute?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the background color of the chart?

  9. Should we include any specific title or subtitle for the chart? If so, please
  provide.

  10. Do you prefer any margin or padding around the chart for better appearance or
  readability?'
