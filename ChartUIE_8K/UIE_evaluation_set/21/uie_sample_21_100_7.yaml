initial_prompt: I need a radar chart to visualize the differences in voice features
  between male and female speakers. The attributes include mean frequency, standard
  deviation, median frequency, skewness, kurtosis, and more. Each axis of the radar
  chart should represent one of these attributes. The chart should have two separate
  lines, one for males and one for females, showcasing their respective values. This
  will help in gender recognition by voice. Please make sure the chart is clear and
  easy to interpret, with distinct colors for male and female categories. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors to represent male and female categories
  on the radar chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading for better readability?

  3. Is there a specific ordering of the attributes on the radar chart axes that you
  prefer?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the line styles (solid, dashed, etc.)
  for male and female categories?

  5. Would you like data labels or values to be displayed at each point on the radar
  chart?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for titles, labels,
  or legends?

  7. Would you prefer the chart to be displayed with a specific title or subtitle?

  8. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would like the radar chart to have?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines representing male
  and female values?'
