initial_prompt: I need an area chart showing the profit trends over time for a popup
  store business. The x-axis should represent the date, while the profit values should
  be plotted on the y-axis. Ensure that the chart highlights any fluctuations in profit,
  making it easy to see high and low points. Include a legend or labels if necessary
  to differentiate between different months or years. The chart should be visually
  appealing, with smooth lines connecting the data points and a shaded area below
  to emphasize the profit variations over the entire period covered in the provided
  data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color of the shaded area under the
  line in the area chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines to make it easier to follow the data points?

  3. Do you prefer the date labels on the x-axis to be formatted in a specific way
  (e.g., "MM-YYYY", "MMM YYYY", "DD-MM-YYYY")?

  4. How frequently would you like the date labels to appear on the x-axis (e.g.,
  every month, quarter, year)?

  5. Would you like to see markers or points on the line to indicate specific data
  points?

  6. Should highs and lows be explicitly marked or annotated in the chart?

  7. Do you have specific font preferences for the labels and legends?

  8. Do you want the area chart to display different shades or tones for different
  months or years?

  9. Would you prefer a specific style for the lines connecting the data points (e.g.,
  straight lines, smooth curves)?

  10. Do you want to include any additional information such as annotations, trend
  lines, or moving averages on the chart?'
