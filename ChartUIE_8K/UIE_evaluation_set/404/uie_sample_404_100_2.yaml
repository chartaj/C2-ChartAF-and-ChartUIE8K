initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the profit data from a popup
  store business. Annotate key data points to highlight their values and draw attention
  to specific elements. Use text annotations to offer context or comments where necessary.
  Highlight unusual or particularly significant profits with a different color to
  make them stand out for easier analysis. The purpose is to provide a clear picture
  of the profit distribution over time, facilitating the identification of trends
  and outliers. Ensure the presentation is clean and the important elements are visually
  distinguishable.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for highlighting unusual or
  significant profits?

  determine them based on the data?

  4. Do you have preferences for the style and placement of the text annotations?

  5. Should the histogram be grouped by specific time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  6. Are there specific trends or periods you are particularly interested in highlighting
  within the histogram?'
