initial_prompt: '<start of data details format>

  I need a line chart displaying the profit progression of our popup store over time.
  Highlight key profit milestones and outliers to make them stand out. Use text annotations
  to describe notable trends and relevant events that might have influenced the profit
  patterns. Ensure the chart is easily readable with clear labels for the date and
  profit axes. This will help us understand the business''s performance and make informed
  decisions.

  <end of data details format>'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should there be specific markers for profit milestones, and if so, what style
  do you prefer (e.g., stars, circles, squares)?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., with different colors
  or shapes)?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for text annotations and labels?

  5. Do you want a specific date format for the x-axis labels?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included for easier readability? If so, should
  they be in a particular style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  7. Are there any specific trends or events you already know that should be annotated
  on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred line style for the profit progression (e.g., dashed,
  solid, dotted)?

  9. Is there a specific range for the profit values on the y-axis that we should
  set, or should it be auto-scaled based on the data?

  10. Should there be a legend included, and if so, what information would you like
  it to contain?

  11. Would you like to include any additional context or commentary on the chart
  to support your presentation to the business stakeholders?'
