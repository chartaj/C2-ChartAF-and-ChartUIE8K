initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap using the avocado price data to show the correlation
  between the different variables like AveragePrice, Total Volume, and the various
  bag sizes across different years and regions. Highlight which types of bags contribute
  most to the Total Volume and how these variables change over time across different
  regions. The heatmap should help identify patterns or anomalies in the data, like
  regions or years with unusually high or low prices or volumes. Use color gradients
  to indicate the strength of correlations between these variables to make it easy
  to spot trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to indicate the
  strength of correlations?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display numerical correlation values on the cells?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for years and regions on the axes for easier
  reference?

  4. Are there specific years or regions you would like to emphasize or isolate within
  the heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer the heatmap to use a specific range of values for color gradients
  (for example, from -1 to 1 for correlations)?

  6. Do you need annotations or markers to explicitly highlight regions or years with
  unusually high or low prices or volumes?

  7. Is there a specific layout you favor for the heatmap (e.g., clustermap, standard
  rectangular grid)?

  8. Would you prefer additional visual elements, such as trend lines, to illustrate
  changes over time?

  9. Should the heatmap emphasize a particular variable more than others, for instance,
  should ''Total Volume'' be more prominently displayed in the correlations?

  10. Do you have any requirements for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap
  to fit within a specific presentation format?'

  8. I do not know.

  9. No, I don''t have a preference for emphasizing a particular variable more than
  others.

  10. I do not have any requirements for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap.
