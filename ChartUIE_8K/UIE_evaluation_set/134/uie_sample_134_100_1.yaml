initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the avocado prices data,
  emphasizing the correlation between AveragePrice and Total Volume. Highlight the
  data points for the year 2015 using a different color to make them stand out. Use
  text annotations to display average prices for the top three regions with the highest
  total volume. This visualization will help us understand how price trends vary with
  volume in different regions. Include a title and labels for the axes for clarity.
  Ensure the plot is suitable for an agriculture and farming audience. Thank you!

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the text annotations?

  5. Do you have specific regions in mind that you want to focus on, or should we
  automatically determine the top three regions with the highest total volume?

  6. Should the axes labels include any specific terms or units?

  7. Do you want the axes to have a specific range or should it be automatically scaled
  based on the data?

  style?
