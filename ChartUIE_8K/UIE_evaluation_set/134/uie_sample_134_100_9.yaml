initial_prompt: I have a dataset about avocado prices across different regions and
  dates. I want to create a choropleth map to visualize this data. The map should
  display the average price of avocados across various regions over time. Each region
  should be color-coded based on the average price, with a gradient that helps quickly
  identify areas with higher or lower prices. This map will help in understanding
  regional price variations. Please use the 'region' for the geographic data and 'AveragePrice'
  for the color scale. Also, ensure that the map is interactive, allowing the selection
  of different years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradient to represent
  prices?

  2. Would you like to include labels for regions directly on the map?

  3. How would you like the date or year selection to be presented (e.g., slider,
  dropdown)?

  4. Do you want to display the exact average price when hovering over a region?

  5. Would you prefer boundaries of regions to be highlighted or left plain?

  6. Is there any specific background or base map style you prefer (e.g., light, dark,
  satellite)?

  7. Do you want any additional data layers or annotations added to the map (e.g.,
  city names, major landmarks)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or color bar to explain the gradient scale?

  9. Are there specific regions or areas you want to focus on or highlight?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the map''s title or subtitles?'
