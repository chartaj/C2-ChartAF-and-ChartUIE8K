initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to compare the Total Volume of avocados
  (on the y-axis) for each Date (on the x-axis) across different sizes (4046, 4225,
  4770). Please use different colors to represent each size category. Make sure to
  create separate charts for each region. Ensure the chart is clear to understand
  fluctuations in avocado size distribution over time. Highlight relevant trends or
  seasonal variations if possible. Include labels and legends for clarity. This will
  help visualize how different avocado sizes contribute to overall volume.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different avocado sizes?

  2. Would you like to include specific markers or annotations for notable trends
  or seasonal variations?

  3. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement and style of the legend?

  5. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (font type, size, color)?

  6. Would you like to display data values on the bars for each avocado size?

  7. Should there be gridlines in the chart, and if so, what style do you prefer?

  8. Are there any specific regions you would like to highlight more prominently in
  the separate charts?

  9. Do you prefer the charts to be displayed in a specific layout or sequence (e.g.,
  alphabetically by region)?

  10. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or commentary within
  the charts?'
