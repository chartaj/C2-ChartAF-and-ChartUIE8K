initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing avocado prices and sales volumes by region,
  year, and type. I want a grouped bar chart that compares the average price and total
  volume for each region, broken down by year. The x-axis should show the regions,
  and the y-axis should show the values. Each bar group represents a year, with one
  bar for average price and another bar for total volume within each group. Please
  label the axes and add a legend to distinguish between average price and total volume.
  This will help visualize trends in avocado pricing and sales.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bars representing
  average price and total volume?

  2. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for axis labels and legends?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines on the y-axis for better readability?

  4. How should the years be ordered within each region group on the x-axis (chronological
  or specific custom order)?

  5. Are there any specific regions you would like to focus on or exclude from the
  chart?

  6. Do you want the chart to include data labels showing the exact values of average
  price and total volume on each bar?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the chart? If so, please specify.

  8. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include in
  the chart to highlight specific trends or insights?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the width or spacing between the bars within
  each group?'
