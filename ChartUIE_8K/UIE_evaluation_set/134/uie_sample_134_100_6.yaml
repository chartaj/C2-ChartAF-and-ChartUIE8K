initial_prompt: I need a box plot to explore the distribution of average avocado prices.
  The dataset includes various years, regions, and types of avocados. The box plot
  should display the AveragePrice on the y-axis and the year on the x-axis. Please
  differentiate between the conventional and organic types using different colors
  or markers. Additionally, include a legend and label the axes clearly. visualizar
  this data to identify trends and variations in avocado prices over the years across
  different regions and types. Make sure the plot is clean and easily interpretable.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme when differentiating\
  \ between conventional and organic types?\n2. Would you like the box plot to include\
  \ individual data points overlaid on the boxes for better visibility of outliers?\n\
  3. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the legend (e.g., location,\
  \ font size)?\n4. Do you want any specific labels or annotations included on the\
  \ chart beyond the axes labels and legend?\n5. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal\
  \ orientation for the box plot?\n6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on\
  \ the chart for better readability? If yes, do you have any preferences for their\
  \ style (e.g., dashed, solid)?\n7. Do you have any preference for the background\
  \ color of the chart (e.g., white, grey)? \n8. Is there a specific font style or\
  \ size you want for the axis labels and title?"
