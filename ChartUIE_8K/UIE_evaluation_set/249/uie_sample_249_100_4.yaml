initial_prompt: I need a step line chart that visualizes the pricing changes of High-Tech
  companies on NASDAQ. The chart should include symbols and names like Apple, Microsoft,
  and Alphabet. Track the price, pricing changes, and pricing percentage changes over
  time. The x-axis should represent a timeline, while the y-axis shows the pricing
  data. Include a legend for each company. It should highlight market movements visually
  for better trend analysis. I also want to see the market cap and share volume alongside
  the pricing data. Please ensure it's clear and concise for business analysis purposes.
questions: '1. What is the desired time interval for the x-axis (daily, weekly, monthly,
  etc.)?

  2. How would you like the y-axis to be scaled (linear, logarithmic)?

  3. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent each company in the
  legend?

  4. Should the market cap and share volume be displayed in separate panels or overlaid
  on the same chart?

  5. For pricing data, should we use closing prices, average prices, or another metric?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for significant events affecting
  the companies?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style for the step line (e.g., step-before, step-after)?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, how dense should they be?

  9. Are there specific date ranges or periods you want to highlight on the chart?

  10. Would you like to include a moving average or any other trend indicators for
  the pricing data?'
