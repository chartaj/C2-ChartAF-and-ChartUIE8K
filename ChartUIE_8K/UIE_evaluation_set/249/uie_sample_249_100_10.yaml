initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the high-tech companies listed on
  NASDAQ using the provided dataset. Specifically, visualize the distributions of
  market capitalization and share volume by sector. Make sure to include labels for
  each sector and use different colors to differentiate the sectors. Annotate the
  medians on the violin plots for clarity. Adjust the plot to focus on the Technology
  sector since it has the most data points. Your effort in creating this visualization
  is highly appreciated. Thank you!
