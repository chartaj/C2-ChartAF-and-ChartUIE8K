initial_prompt: I would like to generate a scatter plot using the provided dataset
  of high-tech companies on NASDAQ. The scatter plot should visualize the relationship
  between the 'market_cap' (Y-axis) and 'price' (X-axis) for these companies. The
  data points should be differentiated by colors based on the 'sector', and each point
  should be labeled with the 'symbol' of the company. Make sure missing data is appropriately
  handled, for example, by using an indication for missing values. The chart should
  also have labels and a title.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the X-axis and Y-axis labels?

  3. What color scheme would you like to use for differentiating sectors?

  4. How would you like missing data to be indicated on the chart?

  5. Would you prefer a legend to explain the colors representing different sectors?

  6. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and title?

  7. Should the data points be represented with specific shapes or just simple dots?

  8. Do you have a preferred size for the markers representing the data points?

  9. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability? If so, do you have
  a preference for their appearance?'
