initial_prompt: Based on the dataset "High-Tech Companies on NASDAQ," create a histogram
  visualizing the distribution of stock prices across different companies. Use the
  'price' column for the horizontal axis, indicating stock price ranges, and the vertical
  axis for the frequency of companies within each price range. Additionally, use color
  coding to distinguish between different sectors within the technology industry,
