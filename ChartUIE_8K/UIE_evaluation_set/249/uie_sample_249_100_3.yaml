initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the high-tech companies on NASDAQ
  from the dataset. The x-axis should represent the 'price' of the stocks, the y-axis
  should show the 'market_cap,' and the size of the bubbles should indicate 'share_volume.'
  Each bubble should be labeled with the 'symbol.' This will give a clear overview
  of the companiesâ€™ stock prices, market capitalization, and trading volumes, helping
  to analyze their market positions effectively. Ensure color-coding for sectors if
  possible. The chart will assist in identifying the relative size and value of tech
  companies in the industry.

  different sectors?

  data points?'
