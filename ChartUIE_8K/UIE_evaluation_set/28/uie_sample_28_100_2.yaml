initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of car prices in
  the dataset. Use the "Price" column for the x-axis to represent price ranges and
  group cars into bins (e.g., $0-$5,000, $5,001-$10,000, etc.). The y-axis should
  display the frequency or count of cars within each price range. This will help in
  understanding the concentration of car prices, which is essential for assessing
  market trends in automobile prices for better predictions. Make sure the histogram
  is clear and labels are readable.
