initial_prompt: I'd like a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of different
  car categories by manufacturer. Please use the 'Category' and 'Manufacturer' columns
  to create this visualization. Each bar should represent a manufacturer, and the
  sections of the bar should represent the different categories. The chart should
  help identify which manufacturers produce the most Jeeps, Hatchbacks, etc. Additionally,
  use different colors for each category for better distinction. This will help me
  understand the variety of car categories each manufacturer offers in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different car categories?

  2. Would you like to display the values or percentages on the bars?

  3. Should the categories be presented in any specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by frequency)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included for easier reading of the chart?

  6. Do you need a legend to identify the different car categories?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you''d like for the labels and titles?

  8. Would you like any specific titles or labels for the axes and the chart itself?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout for the axis labels (e.g., rotated, horizontal)?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?'
