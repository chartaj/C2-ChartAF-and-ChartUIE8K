initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the "Life expectancy in years" across
  different continents from the provided dataset. Since the dataset includes life
  expectancy data from various countries and continents, the histogram should represent
  the range and distribution of life expectancy. Use different colors or patterns
  to differentiate between continents. This will help in understanding the variations
  in life expectancy between different regions of the world. Also, it is important
  to handle missing values appropriately, possibly by excluding them or indicating
  them separately.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  between continents?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which color/pattern corresponds
  to each continent?

  3. How would you prefer to handle and display missing values in the dataset?

  4. Do you have a preference for the number of bins used in the histogram?

  5. Would you like to include axis titles and labels? If so, do you have specific
  titles in mind?

  6. Do you prefer the histogram to have a specific orientation (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you''d like to use for the labels
  and titles?

  8. Would you like to add a title to the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  9. Is there a specific chart style or theme you prefer (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  professional)?

  10. Would you like to include annotations or specific data points highlighted in
  the histogram?'
