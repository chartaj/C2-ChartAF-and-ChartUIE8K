initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Life expectancy
  in years and Income (GDP per capita) across different countries. Highlight specific
  data points for countries in the Africa and Australia continents to emphasize their
  life expectancy and income levels. Use text annotations to showcase the life expectancy
  of countries where data is available for the year 1800 with clear labels. The purpose
  of this visualization is to analyze historical life expectancies in relation to
  income and observe patterns or anomalies for these continents during the given year.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for highlighting countries in
  Africa and Australia?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled or formatted (e.g., specific font,
  size)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size or style of the text annotations for showcasing
  life expectancy?

  4. Are there any specific symbols or markers you would prefer to differentiate the
  highlighted data points?

  5. Would you like a legend included in the chart? If so, any specific formatting
  or information it should display?

  6. How would you like the countries with available data for the year 1800 to be
  labeled (e.g., specific font, color, size)?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the scale of the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include in the chart?

  9. Would you like gridlines in the plot? If so, any specifications on their appearance?

  10. Do you prefer any particular font style for the chart labels and annotations?'
