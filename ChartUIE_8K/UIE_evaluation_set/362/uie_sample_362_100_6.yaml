initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  'CGPA' and 'PlacedOrNot' from the engineering placements dataset. Ensure that each
  point on the scatter plot represents a student's CGPA (on the x-axis) and whether
  they were placed or not (on the y-axis). Use different colors or markers to distinguish
  between 'Placed' and 'Not Placed' students. This will help analyze if higher CGPA
  correlates with successful placements. Additionally, it would be helpful to label
  the axes clearly and provide a legend to interpret the colors or markers used for
  'PlacedOrNot'.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred colors for the 'Placed' and 'Not Placed'\
  \ markers?\n2. Is there a specific style of marker (e.g., circle, square, triangle)\
  \ that you would prefer for the different categories?\n3. Do you want to include\
  \ any gridlines on the scatter plot? If yes, should they be major gridlines, minor\
  \ gridlines, or both?\n4. How detailed should the axis labels be? For example, should\
  \ they include units or additional descriptions?\n5. Would you like the plot to\
  \ include a title? If yes, do you have a specific title in mind?\n6. Do you require\
  \ any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?\n7. Should the legend\
  \ be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?\
  \ \n8. Are there any additional annotations or information you would like to be\
  \ included on the chart?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the colors. Maybe you can choose what''s visually
  clear.

  2. I do not know, any standard markers you think are appropriate.

  3. Yes, I would like to include major gridlines.

  4. Just the basic axis labels: "CGPA" for the x-axis and "Placed or Not" for the
  y-axis.

  5. Yes, a title would be good. Something like "Scatter Plot of CGPA vs. Placement
  Status".

  6. I am not sure about the font style or size, standard readable fonts should be
  fine.

  7. I have no specific preference about the legend''s location, maybe top-right.

  8. No, I do not require any additional annotations or information on the chart.'
