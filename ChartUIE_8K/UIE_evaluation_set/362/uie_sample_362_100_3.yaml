initial_prompt: I need a heatmap for visualizing the correlation between different
  attributes in the given engineering placements dataset. Specifically, the heatmap
  should highlight how factors like Age, Gender, Stream, Internships, CGPA, Hostel,
  and History of Backlogs affect the PlacedOrNot outcome. This will help in understanding
  the key features that influence placement outcomes among engineering students. Please
  ensure the heatmap clearly distinguishes between positive and negative correlations,
  making it easy to interpret which variables most significantly impact the placement
  chances. This visualization will be used for a quick, intuitive analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for distinguishing
  positive and negative correlations in the heatmap?

  2. What range of correlation values would you like to emphasize (e.g., only strong
  correlations greater than 0.5 or less than -0.5)?

  3. How detailed would you like the annotations on the heatmap to be (e.g., show
  correlation coefficients in each cell)?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to include labels for both rows and columns for ease
  of interpretation?

  5. Do you prefer any particular order for the attributes on the heatmap (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on the strength of correlation)?

  6. Are there any specific titles, subtitles, or axis labels you would like to include
  on the heatmap?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be shown or hidden on the heatmap for visual clarity?'
