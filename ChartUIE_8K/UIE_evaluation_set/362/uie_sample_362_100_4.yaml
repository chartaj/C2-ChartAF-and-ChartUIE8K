initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the placement status ('PlacedOrNot')
  of students against various streams ('Stream'). Use different colors to distinguish
  between students placed and not placed. Ensure the chart displays the number of
  students for each stream, differentiated by their placement status. Additionally,
  include gender ('Gender') as a secondary stack to show the distribution of male
  and female students within each placement status for every stream. This will help
  understand how placement varies across different streams and genders. Make sure
  to include a legend for clarity and use descriptive axis labels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  placement statuses?

  2. Is there a preferred color scheme for differentiating between male and female
  students within each placement status?

  3. How would you like the streams to be ordered on the chart (e.g., alphabetically,
  by number of students, by placement rate)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style or format for the axis labels?

  5. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart text?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall layout and size of the chart?

  8. Should the legend be placed at a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or data points you would like to highlight
  on the chart?'
