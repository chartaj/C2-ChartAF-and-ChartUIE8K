initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the provided data to visualize the
  distribution of CGPA among students across different streams in relation to their
  placement status. Highlight and annotate specific CGPA ranges where students were
  predominantly placed or not placed to draw focus on significant trends. Ensure the
  chart clearly separates internship holders and non-holders to indicate their impact
  on CGPA and placement likelihood. Incorporate text annotations to emphasize key
  data points, such as specific CGPA ranges with the highest placement rates. This
  will assist in understanding factors influencing engineering placements.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars, especially
  for separated categories like internship holders and non-holders?

  2. How would you like the specific CGPA ranges to be annotated on the histogram?

  3. Do you have preferences for the position and style of text annotations on the
  chart?

  4. Would you like a legend to differentiate between internship holders and non-holders,
  and if so, where should it be placed?

  5. Should there be any specific title or labels for the axes that you prefer?

  6. Are there specific fonts or sizes you would like used for text elements on the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Please annotate them directly on the bars with different colors or symbols indicating
  high placement rates and low placement rates.

  3. I do not have specific preferences for the position and style of text annotations.

  4. Yes, a legend to differentiate between internship holders and non-holders would
  be helpful. It can be placed in the top right corner.

  5. The title can be "CGPA Distribution vs. Placement Status" and the axes can be
  labeled "CGPA Range" for the x-axis and "Number of Students" for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure.'
