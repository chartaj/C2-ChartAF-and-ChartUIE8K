initial_prompt: Create a radial bar chart to visualize the placement chances of engineering
  students based on multiple factors like age, gender, stream, internships, CGPA,
  hostel stay, and backlogs. Use data from the provided dataset for accurate analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different categories
  or factors in the chart?
