initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the ingredients and their corresponding
  grams from the dataset. Use text annotations to show the exact gram values above
  each bar to highlight specific ingredients. Additionally, use highlights to differentiate
  the ingredients by color to emphasize the varying amounts used. The purpose of this
  chart is to provide a clear and immediate understanding of the quantity of each
  ingredient used in the recipe, especially useful for food and drink preparations.
  Add context on the x-axis for the ingredient names and the y-axis for the gram measurements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the bars
  to differentiate the ingredients?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations showing the
  gram values?

  3. Would you like the bars to have any specific width or spacing between them?

  4. Do you prefer any particular orientation for the bar chart (horizontal or vertical)?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the ingredients to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by gram value)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to have for the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  7. Do you have any preferred style or format for highlights to emphasize the varying
  amounts used?'
