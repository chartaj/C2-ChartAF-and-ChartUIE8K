initial_prompt: Create a pie chart using the provided data to visualize the proportion
  of each ingredient by grams. The chart should use text annotations to label the
  segments with ingredient names and their corresponding gram values to highlight
  the contribution of each ingredient. Use different colors for each segment to make
  them stand out and easily distinguishable. This visualization will help understand
  the ingredient distribution in the recipe. It is crucial for quick insights and
  better ingredient management in the food and drink industry. Include the summary
  and sample data for accuracy.

  4. Would you like to include a legend alongside the pie chart, or rely solely on
  the text annotations?

  5. Is there a preferred style for the pie chart (e.g., 2D, 3D)?

  6. Would you like any specific information highlighted or emphasized in the chart?

  7. Do you need the chart to include percentage values along with gram values for
  each segment?'
