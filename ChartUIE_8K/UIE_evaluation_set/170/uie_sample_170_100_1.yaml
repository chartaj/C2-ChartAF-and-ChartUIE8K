  Create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of students'' GPAs based on
  their gender, ethnicity, and parental education. Highlight and annotate sections
  showing the highest and lowest GPA ranges to emphasize differences. Ensure the chart
  is visually appealing and easy to interpret, helping viewers compare educational
  outcomes among different demographic groups. The purpose is to gain insights into
  how different factors affect students'' academic performance. Additionally, use
  text annotations to point out key statistics, such as the average GPA for each gender
  and ethnicity group.
