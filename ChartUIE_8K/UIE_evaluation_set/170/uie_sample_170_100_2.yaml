initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize students' GPA against their weekly
  study time. Highlight the points representing students with the highest and lowest
  GPAs. Add text annotations to these highlighted points showing their GPA and weekly
  study time. Ensure the chart provides a clear understanding of how study time correlates
  with academic performance. Include axis labels and a title for clarity. Use different
  colors for points based on the ParentalSupport variable to also see if it affects
  the GPA-study time relationship. This will help in identifying trends and outliers,
  and understanding the impact of study habits.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the points based on the ParentalSupport
  variable?

  2. What kind of markers would you like to use for the points representing students
  (e.g., circles, squares)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text annotations
  on the highlighted points?

  5. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the axis labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to indicate the colors representing the different
  levels of ParentalSupport?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement or style of the text annotations
  for the highest and lowest GPA points?

  8. Are there any specific grid line styles or background colors you would prefer
  for the scatter plot?'
