initial_prompt: Visualize the students' GPA and study time per week using a heatmap.
  Highlight high GPAs and low absences. Add annotations for extreme values to emphasize
  outliers and trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the

  specific color?

  borders, specific colors)

  (e.g., ''hours per week'' for study time)?
