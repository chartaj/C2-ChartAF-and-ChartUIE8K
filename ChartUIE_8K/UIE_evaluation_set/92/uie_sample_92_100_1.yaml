initial_prompt: Create a histogram showcasing the distribution of Life Expectancy
  across different years for countries grouped by Income Group from the given dataset.
  Emphasize regions with the highest and lowest life expectancy for each income category.
  Add annotations to highlight key data points such as the average life expectancy
  for each income group. Include highlights on significant differences in distribution
  patterns between high-income and low-income groups. This visualization aims to provide
  insights into socio-economic disparities affecting life expectancy globally. The
  focus should be on visual clarity and interpretability for policy analysts and researchers
  in social sciences.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  income groups?

  2. Would you like specific regions highlighted or labeled in a particular way?

  3. Are there any particular years you want emphasized more than others?

  4. Do you have a preference for the type of annotations (e.g., arrows, text labels)
  used to highlight key data points?

  5. What level of detail do you prefer for the annotations? Should they include exact
  numbers or general statements?

  6. Would you like the histogram to show bin counts or percentages?

  7. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal layout for the histogram?

  8. How would you like us to represent significant differences in distribution patterns
  between high-income and low-income groups (e.g., using different patterns or shades)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer text labels.

  5. Exact numbers would be helpful.
