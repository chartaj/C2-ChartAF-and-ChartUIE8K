  (%) by IncomeGroup and Region. Annotate highest and lowest spending countries. Highlight
  countries with missing values distinctively. Focus on year 2001.

  Regions, or the missing values highlight?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the IncomeGroups or Regions to appear
  on the x-axis?

  left, right)?

  7. Do you want gridlines to be included or excluded in the background of the chart?

  8. Are there any specific chart titles or axis labels you want to use? If yes, please
  specify.

  9. Do you prefer stacked bars to be shaded or patterned to indicate missing data,
  or should they just be colored differently?
