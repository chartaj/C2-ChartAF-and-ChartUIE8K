initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Life Expectancy
  and CO2 emissions for different countries across various years. Use 'Country Name'
  as the labels for the points. Also, color-code the points based on 'Region'. On
  the x-axis, plot 'CO2' emissions, and on the y-axis, plot 'Life Expectancy World
  Bank'. Highlight differences in income groups by using different marker shapes.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret, showing any noticeable trends or
  anomalies in the data. Also, include a legend and appropriate axis labels.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing regions?\n\
  2. Are there any preferred shapes you would like to use for the different income\
  \ groups?\n3. What font style and size would you prefer for the country labels on\
  \ the points?\n4. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or aspect ratio\
  \ of the scatter plot?\n5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart,\
  \ and if so, in which style?\n6. Is there a specific title you would like for the\
  \ scatter plot?\n7. Do you have any preferences for the style and placement of the\
  \ legend? \n8. Should the axis labels include any specific formatting or units?"
