initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships in dance types and
  styles across various parameters. I want to see how factors like "Origin", "Time
  Period", "Cultural Significance", "Notable Characteristics", and "Instrumental"
  affect the dance styles. Highlight key correlations, such as high "Tempo (BPM)"
  and "Health Benefits". Use color gradients to represent the "Hardness Ratio" and
  "Learning Difficulty". Ensure readability by keeping the data points distinct and
  well-labeled. This chart will help me understand the distribution and prominence
  of different dance features.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. What color gradients would you prefer to use for representing ''Hardness Ratio''
  and ''Learning Difficulty''?

  3. Do you prefer a specific layout or order for the parameters on the axes?

  4. How important is it for you to have a legend or key that explains the color gradients?

  5. Do you want the data points to have any specific labels or annotations?

  6. Is there any specific range or scale you prefer for ''Tempo (BPM)''?

  7. Would you like to have grid lines and borders between cells for better readability?

  8. Are there any parameters that you want to be emphasized more than others?

  9. Should the heatmap include any additional information such as data point counts
  or averages?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size of the labels
  and annotations?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer parameters to be ordered by their importance to dance styles, but I
  am not sure which ones should be prioritized.

  4. Having a legend or key that explains the color gradients is important to me.

  5. Yes, I want the data points to have specific labels or annotations to ensure
  clarity.

  6. I do not have a specific range or scale for ''Tempo (BPM)''.

  7. Yes, I would like to have grid lines and borders between cells for better readability.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No, the additional information such as data point counts or averages is not necessary.

  10. I have no specific preference for the font style and size of the labels and
  annotations.
