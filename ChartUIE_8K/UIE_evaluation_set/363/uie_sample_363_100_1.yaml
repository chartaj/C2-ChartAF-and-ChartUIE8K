initial_prompt: Visualize the change in fatal police encounters over time using a
  line chart. Plot the "date" on the x-axis and count of incidents on the y-axis.
  Differentiate lines by "race" to highlight trends in various demographic groups.
  Utilize annotations to emphasize key peaks or declines, mentioning potential contextual
  factors like policy changes or significant events. Highlight any noticeable patterns.
  Purpose is to understand temporal trends and disparities in police shootings, which
  can inform law and policy considerations. Use the "US Police Shootings" dataset
  and ensure clarity in highlighting changes over periods.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  lines by race?

  2. Are there specific time intervals you would like to be represented on the x-axis
  (e.g., months, years)?

  3. Do you have any specific fonts or styles in mind for the annotations?

  4. Would you prefer a legend to be included inside or outside the chart?

  5. Are there any particular policy changes or significant events that you want to
  be highlighted in the annotations?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for key peaks or declines (e.g., arrows, highlights,
  specific symbols)?

  7. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scaling method (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. How would you like missing data to be represented, if at all (e.g., gaps, interpolations)?

  9. Do you need grid lines on the plot? If so, do you prefer them to be major, minor,
  or both?

  10. Is there any supplementary information or context you want displayed alongside
  the chart (e.g., titles, subtitles, source information)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Years would be best.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer the legend to be included inside the chart.

  5. Yes, the Black Lives Matter movement and certain high-profile cases like George
  Floyd should be highlighted in the annotations.

  6. Arrows would be good for key peaks or declines.

  7. Linear scaling is fine.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Major grid lines would be helpful.

  10. Titles, subtitles, and source information should be displayed along with the
  chart.'
