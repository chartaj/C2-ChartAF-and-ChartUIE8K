initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the ages of individuals involved in
  US police shootings. Highlight the age groups that have the highest frequencies.
  Use text annotations to display the number of occurrences within these highlighted
  age groups. Emphasize the distribution of ages and incorporate data-driven text
  annotations for clarity. Ensure the chart also indicates the presence of mental
  illness, showing the proportion of cases with and without it through color-coding
  or other visual distinction. This will provide insights into age-related patterns
  and possible mental health factors in police shootings.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing cases with and without
  signs of mental illness?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the bin size or number of bins in the
  histogram?

  3. Would you like a particular style or format for the text annotations displaying
  the number of occurrences?

  4. Are there any specific age groups you want to highlight or should it be based
  strictly on the highest frequencies observed in the data?

  5. Do you have any preferred font type or size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Are there any additional data labels or markers you would like included in the
  chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the histogram?

  8. Would you like custom legends or titles for the chart to improve clarity?'
