  across different categories for various state FIPS codes on specific dates. The
  x-axis should represent the categories, including All Merchant Category Codes, ACF,
  AER, GEN and AAP, GRF, HCS, TWS, and retail spending both including and excluding
  grocery. The y-axis should show the percent change in spending. Use text annotations
  to highlight the values for each bar, emphasizing those with significant changes.
