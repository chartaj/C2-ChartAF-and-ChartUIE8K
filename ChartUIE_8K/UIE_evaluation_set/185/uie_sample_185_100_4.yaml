initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the percent change in consumer spending
  across various categories over different dates. Use the "State FIPS code" as the
  row axis and the "Date" as the column axis. Each cell should represent the percent
  change for one of the spending categories like 'All merchant category codes spending',
  'Accommodation and food service spending', etc. Include a color gradient to distinguish
  between increases and decreases in spending. Ensure the heatmap clearly shows areas
  with significant spending changes, using varying shades to indicate the magnitude
  of changes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient to represent increases
  and decreases in spending?

  2. What range of percent changes are you most interested in highlighting (e.g.,
  -50% to +50%)?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., specific ordering of state
  codes or dates)?

  4. Would you like to include annotations or labels on the heatmap cells to show
  the exact percent change values?

  5. Do you prefer any specific categories of spending to be emphasized or highlighted
  in the visualization?

  6. Are there any specific dates or time ranges that you want to focus on in the
  heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color gradient and the percent
  change ranges?

  8. Do you want to aggregate the data in any way (e.g., weekly, monthly) rather than
  displaying daily changes?

  9. Should the heatmap support the comparison of multiple spending categories side
  by side?'
