initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'total_cup_points'
  from the provided coffee ratings data. The x-axis should represent the range of
  total cup points, and the y-axis should show the number of occurrences or count
  of each point range. This will help us to understand the frequency of different
  cup points in the dataset. Ensure the histogram bins are appropriately sized to
  capture the variation in cup points accurately. Additionally, label the axes for
  clarity and add a title like "Distribution of Coffee Cup Points".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins, or should the bin size be automatically
  determined?

  2. Is there a specific color scheme you prefer for the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reading?

  4. Should any specific statistical metrics (mean, median, etc.) be highlighted on
  the histogram?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or specific markers on the chart?

  7. Do you want to display the y-axis in terms of absolute counts or normalized proportions?

  8. Should there be any specific margin or spacing considerations for the chart layout?

  9. Do you require a legend, even though it may not be typical for a histogram?

  10. Are there any additional labeling or notations you would like on the x-axis
  or y-axis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, so you can determine the bin size automatically.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  3. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart for easier reading.

  4. I am not sure about highlighting any specific statistical metrics.

  5. I do not know, you can choose a standard font style and size.

  6. I do not have any specific annotations or markers in mind.

  7. Displaying y-axis in absolute counts is preferred.

  8. I have no specific preferences for the margin or spacing.

  9. No, a legend is not necessary.

  10. I have no additional labeling or notations required.'
