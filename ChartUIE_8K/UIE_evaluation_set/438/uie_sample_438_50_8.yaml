initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between various coffee attributes
  such as aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, and balance. This will help visualize
  how different attributes affect the total cup points of coffee.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a color bar to indicate the magnitude of the correlation?

  3. Should the correlations be annotated with numerical values on the heatmap?

  4. Do you have any specific range settings for the correlation values (e.g., -1
  to 1)?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the attributes to be ordered on the axes?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a specific size for the heatmap to accommodate your viewing or
  presentation needs?

  8. Are there any particular labels or titles you would like to include on the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to highlight specific correlation pairs or ranges on the heatmap?

  10. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the labels and titles
  on the heatmap?'
