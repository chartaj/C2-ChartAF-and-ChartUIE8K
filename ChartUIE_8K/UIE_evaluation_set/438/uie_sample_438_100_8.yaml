initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the coffee ratings data. Use columns
  like total_cup_points, aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance, and sweetness
  to show how different coffee attributes score across various samples. Highlight
  missing values and defects using distinct colors. Ensure the chart showcases correlation
  patterns among the attributes. This will help identify quality trends and any anomalies
  in the dataset. Include a clear legend and labels for easy interpretation, and consider
  different color gradients to represent scoring variations effectively. Make it interactive
  for better user engagement.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for the
  heatmap?

  2. How would you prefer the missing values and defects to be highlighted, in terms
  of color or pattern?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend and labels on the chart?

  4. Are there specific scoring variations that you want particular attention drawn
  to through color gradients?

  5. Is there a specific range or scaling you''d prefer for the heatmap values?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  7. Would you like the axes to be labeled in a specific way or order?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe a distinct color like red for defects and a pattern
  for missing values.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific range or scaling in mind.

  6. I do not have any specific preferences for fonts or font sizes.

  7. I am not sure about the axes labeling.'
