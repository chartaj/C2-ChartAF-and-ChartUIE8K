initial_prompt: Can you create a scatter plot from the coffee ratings data? I want
  to compare the 'total_cup_points' on the Y-axis with the 'altitude_mean_meters'
  on the X-axis. Use different colors or shapes to differentiate between the 'species'.
  This should give a clear visualization of how altitude affects the cup points for
  different coffee species. Make sure to include labels for the axes and a legend
  for clarity. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the coffee species?

  2. Would you prefer certain shapes (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) to be used
  for different species?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and legend?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, how prominent
  should they be?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the title of the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or highlights to emphasize specific points
  or trends in the data?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, gridlines should be included but not too prominent.

  5. No specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.'
