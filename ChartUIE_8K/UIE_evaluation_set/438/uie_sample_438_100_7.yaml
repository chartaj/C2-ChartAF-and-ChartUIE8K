initial_prompt: I have coffee rating data that includes scores for various attributes
  like aroma, flavor, acidity, etc. I want to create a bar chart that visualizes the
  average scores for each attribute (aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, balance,
  etc.) across the different coffee samples. The x-axis should represent the attributes
  and the y-axis should represent the average score for those attributes. This will
  help me quickly see which attributes generally score higher or lower on average
  in the coffee ratings.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels showing the exact average scores on the bars?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be horizontal or vertical?

  4. Should the chart include a title? If so, what would you like it to be?

  5. Would you like to add gridlines to the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  7. Do you want to include any annotation or notes within the chart?

  8. How would you like the attribute names to be displayed on the x-axis (full names,
  abbreviations, or rotated for better fit)?

  9. Would you prefer a plain background or a patterned one for the chart?'
