initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the coffee ratings dataset.
  The x-axis should represent different coffee samples, and the y-axis should show
  the total cup points scored. Include lines for individual scoring categories like
  aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, and balance to represent how each contributes
  to the total cup points. Use distinct colors for each scoring category to differentiate
  them easily. This chart will help in comparing the overall and attribute-specific
  performances of different coffee samples. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for the
  distinct lines?

  2. Would you like the X-axis to be labeled with specific names or numbers for coffee
  samples?

  3. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for each scoring category?

  4. Should we include markers on the lines to denote individual data points?

  5. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you have any preference for the chart title or any additional annotations
  to be included?'
