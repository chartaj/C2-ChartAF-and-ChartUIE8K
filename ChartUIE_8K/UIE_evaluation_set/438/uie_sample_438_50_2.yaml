initial_prompt: Visualize coffee quality across different origins using a geographic
  heatmap. Highlight key metrics like aroma, flavor, and overall ratings. Include
  text annotations for top-performing regions. This will help identify regions producing
  the highest quality coffee.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display gradients or discrete colors for different ranges
  of quality metrics?

  3. Would you prefer a particular map projection or geographic boundary style for
  visual accuracy?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the annotations for top-performing regions
  to be styled or positioned?

  5. How would you like to handle regions with missing data? Should they be left blank
  or marked with a special indicator?

  6. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  7. Are there any specific legends or scales that you would like to be included on
  the map?

  8. Would you prefer the data points to be grouped by regions, countries, or any
  other geographic boundaries?

  9. Is there a preferred order or grouping for the metrics displayed (e.g., aroma,
  flavor, overall ratings)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the base map style (e.g., terrain, satellite,
  or plain)?'
