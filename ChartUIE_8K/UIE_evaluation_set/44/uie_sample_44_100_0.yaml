initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot visualizing the physical and chemical properties
  of amino acids, focusing on the molecular weight (y-axis) against the residue weight
  (x-axis). Annotate specific data points for Alanine, Cysteine, and Aspartic acid
  to highlight their unique properties like pKa and pl values. Utilize highlights
  to emphasize different groups based on the 'Letter' category. The visualization
  should help in distinguishing key amino acids and their properties, facilitating
  an understanding of their role in chemistry. Provide context for how molecular attributes
  vary across different amino acids.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different groups
  based on the ''Letter'' category?

  2. What style of annotations do you prefer for the points representing Alanine,
  Cysteine, and Aspartic acid (e.g., text labels, pop-up tooltips)?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better reference, or prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  4. Do you have a preferred font type and size for text annotations and titles?

  5. Should the highlights for different groups be solid colors, patterns, or both?

  6. Do you have a specific legend placement preference (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right, within the plot area)?

  7. Would you like the dots to be sized proportionally to another variable, or remain
  uniform in size?

  8. Are there any other data points or attributes you would like to see included
  or emphasized in the dot plot besides Alanine, Cysteine, and Aspartic acid?

  9. Do you prefer the axis labels to be on the inside or outside of the plot area?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Text labels would be good.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Solid colors would be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Remain uniform in size.

  8. No, those three are enough.

  9. I don''t know.'
