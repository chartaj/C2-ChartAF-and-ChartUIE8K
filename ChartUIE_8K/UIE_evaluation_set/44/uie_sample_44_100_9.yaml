initial_prompt: I want to create a stacked bar chart visualizing the physical and
  chemical properties of amino acids. Specifically, I need the x-axis to represent
  the amino acids' names (e.g., Alanine, Cysteine, Aspartic acid), and the y-axis
  to show the values for multiple properties like SASA, VSC, and P1. Each bar should
  be divided into segments representing these properties. Additionally, please include
  legends to differentiate between the segments, making comparisons between the amino
  acids easier. Use data available in the dataset to fill in the values accordingly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the segments in the stacked
  bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order, such as alphabetically by amino
  acid name or by the values of one of the properties?

  3. Would you like to include axis titles and if so, what should they be labeled?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legends?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s background color?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines on the y-axis for easier comparison?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to include data value labels on each segment of the bars?

  8. Are there any specific amino acids you would like to highlight or annotate in
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Alphabetically by amino acid name would be good.

  3. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Amino Acids" and the y-axis as "Property Values."

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines on the y-axis for easier comparison.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No, there are no specific amino acids to highlight.'
