initial_prompt: Please create a column chart representing the physical and chemical
  properties of amino acids. The chart should display the molecular weight, residue
  weight, and pI values for each amino acid, highlighting unique properties such as
  high molecular weight. Include text annotations for the highest and lowest values
  in these categories to draw attention. The purpose of this visualization is to compare
  properties across different amino acids and understand their variations. This visualization
  will be useful for an educational purpose in a chemistry class.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Should they include units of measurement?

  4. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the amino acids on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by molecular weight)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend in the chart? If so, what details should it
  contain?

  6. Do you prefer a certain style for highlighting the highest and lowest values
  (e.g., bold, different colors, markers)?

  7. Are there any specific gridline styles or backgrounds you would like for the
  chart?

  8. How detailed should the text annotations be for the highest and lowest values?

  9. Should there be any additional notes or descriptions included in the chart for
  educational context?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart dimensions or aspect ratio?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Please label the axes with the property name and include units of measurement.

  4. Alphabetical ordering would be preferred.

  5. Yes, include a legend that identifies molecular weight, residue weight, and pI
  values.

  6. Highlight the highest and lowest values with different colors and markers.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Include brief text annotations for the highest and lowest values; no need for
  extensive details.

  9. Yes, please include additional notes or descriptions for educational context.

  10. I do not have a specific preference for the chart dimensions or aspect ratio.'
