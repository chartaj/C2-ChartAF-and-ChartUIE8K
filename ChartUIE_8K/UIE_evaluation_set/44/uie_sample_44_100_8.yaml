initial_prompt: Can you please create a pie chart that shows the distribution of unique
  values for each column in the dataset about amino acids' physical and chemical properties?
  Specifically, I'm interested in visualizing how the unique values are spread out
  across columns like 'Molecular Weight', 'pKa1', 'pKb2', and 'carbon'. This would
  help me get a quick overview of the diversity within these properties. Use the given
  data summary to generate the chart. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used in the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the pie chart slices to be labeled with percentages, values, or
  both?

  3. Do you have a specific font preference for the labels and legends?

  4. Should we include a legend to identify each section of the pie chart, or do you
  prefer the labels to be directly on the slices?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the unique values to be represented
  (e.g., ascending, descending)?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a 3D effect or should it remain in 2D?

  7. Would you like the chart to include any annotations or additional information
  for context?

  8. Do you have any preference for the title of the pie chart? If yes, please specify.'
