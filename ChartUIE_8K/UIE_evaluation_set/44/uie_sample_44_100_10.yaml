initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the provided data on amino acids.
  The chart should display the molecular weights of each amino acid on the Y-axis
  and their names on the X-axis. Highlight the differences in molecular weights by
  using different colors. Ensure that the chart is clear, well-labeled, and accurately
  represents the given data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the molecular
  weights?

  2. Would you like to use a specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, in what
  style?

  4. Do you prefer any specific format for the axis labels (e.g., horizontal, vertical,
  angled)?

  5. Would you like the bars to have a specific width or spacing between them?

  6. Should any specific amino acids be highlighted or annotated?

  7. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, how would you prefer it to be
  styled?

  9. Do you have a preference for the overall chart dimensions (width and height)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or markers that you would like to include
  on the chart?'
