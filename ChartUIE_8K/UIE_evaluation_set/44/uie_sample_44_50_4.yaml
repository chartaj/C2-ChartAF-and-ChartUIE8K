initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the amino acid
  properties (e.g., Molecular Weight, Residue Weight, pKa1, pKb2, pKx3, pl4) in the
  provided data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., single
  hue, diverging, sequential)?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to represent the strength of correlation,
  with specific colors for positive/negative correlations?

  3. Do you prefer displaying correlation values within the heatmap cells?

  4. Are there any specific correlation thresholds that should be highlighted or annotated
  in the heatmap?

  5. Would you prefer the axes to be labeled with the full property names or abbreviations?

  6. Do you desire hierarchical clustering to group similar properties together within
  the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale used for correlations?

  8. Do you wish to have gridlines between the cells for better clarity?

  9. Would you like to include any specific contextual information or annotations
  outside of the correlation data itself?'
