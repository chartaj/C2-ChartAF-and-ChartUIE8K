initial_prompt: 'Create a dot plot to visualize amino acid properties. Highlight Molecular
  Weight, Residue Weight, and pl4. Add text annotations for pKa1 and pKb2. Purpose:
  to compare amino acids based on these chemical attributes.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for highlighting the
  different attributes?

  2. What size and style of dot markers would you prefer for the plot?

  3. How should the highlighted values for Molecular Weight, Residue Weight, and pl4
  be differentiated (e.g., color, shape, size)?

  4. Where would you prefer the text annotations for pKa1 and pKb2 to be positioned
  relative to the points?

  5. Would you prefer a legend to explain the various attributes or any specific labels
  on the axes?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the text annotations
  and axis labels?

  7. What range or scaling would you prefer for the axes (linear or logarithmic)?

  8. Would you like gridlines in the background? If so, what type and color?

  9. Do you have any preference for the overall layout (e.g., spacing between dots,
  margins, title placement)?

  10. Is there any additional contextual information you would like to be included
  in the chart (e.g., a brief description or footnote)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I would prefer the text annotations for pKa1 and pKb2 to be near the respective
  points, but I am not sure about the exact placement.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
