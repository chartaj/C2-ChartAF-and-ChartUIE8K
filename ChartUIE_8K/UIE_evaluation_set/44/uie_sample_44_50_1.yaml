initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the molecular weights of amino
  acids. Highlight columns with missing pKa1 values and annotate the highest and lowest
  molecular weights. The purpose is to compare molecular weights and identify patterns
  related to missing values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, what details should it convey?

  5. How would you like to represent the columns with missing pKa1 values (e.g., different
  color, pattern)?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have any specific title or subtitle?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the amino acids to be displayed in (alphabetical,
  by molecular weight, etc.)?

  9. Are there any additional details or data attributes you would like to include
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Highlight the missing pKa1 values with a different color.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Order by molecular weight, from lowest to highest.

  9. I am not sure.'
