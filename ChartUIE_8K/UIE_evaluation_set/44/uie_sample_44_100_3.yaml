initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the physical and chemical properties
  of amino acids. Use the provided data set, focusing on properties like Molecular
  Weight, Residue Weight, pKa1, pKb2, pKx3, and pl4. I want the X-axis to represent
  the different amino acids (by their names) and the Y-axis to show the numerical
  values of these properties. This will help in comparing the amino acids' properties
  across these dimensions. Also, highlight any missing values in the data clearly
  in the chart. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color schemes for highlighting missing values?

  2. Would you like to use distinct line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) for each property?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify each property line?

  4. Do you want the Y-axis to have a logarithmic scale or a regular scale?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the amino acids to be arranged
  on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by Molecular Weight)?

  6. Are there any specific axis labels or chart titles you would like to include?

  7. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability of the data points?

  8. Do you want data points to be marked with symbols (e.g., circles, squares) on
  the lines?

  9. Should the chart include tooltips or data labels to show exact values when hovered
  over or viewed?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to identify each property line.

  4. Regular scale.

  5. No specific preference.

  6. No specific axis labels or chart titles needed.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. Yes, mark data points with symbols.

  9. No, I am only looking for an image, not interactive elements.'
