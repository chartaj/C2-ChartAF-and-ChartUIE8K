initial_prompt: Can you create a table chart that displays the physical and chemical
  properties of amino acids? The table should include columns for Name, Abbr, Letter,
  Molecular Weight, Molecular Formula, Residue Formula, Residue Weight, pKa1, pKb2,
  pKx3, pl4, H, VSC, P1, P2, SASA, NCISC, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and
  sulfur. Please ensure that the table highlights missing values and categorizes the
  data in a way that's easy to understand and interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting missing values
  in the table?

  2. How would you like the data to be categorized (e.g., by molecular weight, formula
  type, or another factor)?

  3. Should the table include any specific sorting (e.g., alphabetically by Name,
  by molecular weight in ascending order)?

  4. Are there any specific data attributes that you would like to be prominently
  highlighted in the table?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font size and style used in the table for
  better readability?

  6. Should the table include tooltips or additional annotations for certain data
  points?

  7. Would you prefer the table to display all data at once, or should it allow for
  filtering or collapsing categories for easier navigation?'
