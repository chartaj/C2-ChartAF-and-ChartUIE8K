initial_prompt: I need a table chart visualizing the physical and chemical properties
  of amino acids. Include columns for Name, Abbr, Letter, Molecular Weight, Molecular
  Formula, Residue Formula, Residue Weight, pKa1, pKb2, pKx3, pl4, H, VSC, P1, P2,
  SASA, NCISC, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur. Ensure the table highlights
  missing values and unique values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting missing values
  and unique values?

  2. Should the table include any specific formatting for numerical values (e.g.,
  number of decimal places)?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the table content?

  4. Would you like the table to include any borders or gridlines for better readability?

  5. Do you want any specific sorting or ordering of the rows or columns?

  6. Should the table include any tooltips, annotations, or notes for certain cells?
