initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the molecular weights and residue
  weights of the amino acids. Ensure each amino acid is distinctly colored for clarity.
  Highlight the key metrics, such as pKa1 and pKb2 values, for notable amino acids
  like Alanine, Cysteine, and Aspartic acid with text annotations. This visualization
  will help in understanding the variance in chemical properties among different amino
  acids. Add a legend to indicate what the bars represent and title the chart as "Comparison
  of Amino Acid Properties". The chart should aid in examining the physical and chemical
  properties of amino acids.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for pKa1 and pKb2 values to be styled
  (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the bar width in the grouped bar chart?

  4. Would you prefer the chart to have gridlines for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific font you would like to use for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Should the axis titles include units of measurements where applicable?

  7. Do you want the notable amino acids to have specific distinguishable markers
  on their bars?

  8. Should the y-axis range be automatically adjusted or fixed to a specified range?

  9. Do you want to include any trend lines or average lines in the chart?

  10. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to include in
  the legend?'
