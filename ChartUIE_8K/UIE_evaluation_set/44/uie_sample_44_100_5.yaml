initial_prompt: 'Please create a histogram chart to visualize the distribution of
  the Molecular Weight and Residue Weight for different amino acids. The chart should
  have two histograms side by side: one for the Molecular Weight and one for the Residue
  Weight. Ensure that the x-axis represents the weight values and the y-axis represents
  the count or frequency of amino acids falling into those weight bins. This visualization
  will help in understanding the variation in weights among amino acids. Make sure
  to label the axes and provide a legend to distinguish between the two histograms.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color of the histograms?

  2. What range of weight values would you like to set for the x-axis?

  3. How many bins would you prefer for the histograms?

  4. Do you want specific labels on the x-axis for certain weight values?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels
  and legend?

  6. Would you like to display gridlines on the chart?

  7. Do you have a specific layout preference for the two histograms (e.g., side-by-side
  horizontally or vertically)?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to the
  chart?

  9. Do you want a title for the chart? If yes, what text should be used for the title?

  10. Is there any specific format for the legend you prefer (e.g., location, styling)?

  11. Would you prefer the histograms to be normalized (i.e., showing the relative
  frequency) instead of the absolute count?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, perhaps the full range of weights commonly found in amino acids.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure, maybe yes.

  7. Side-by-side horizontally.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, "Distribution of Molecular Weight and Residue Weight of Amino Acids".

  10. I do not have a specific preference.

  11. I do not know.'
