initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the pKa1, pKb2, and pKx3 values of
  different amino acids. Include labels for each amino acid on the x-axis and the
  respective pKa1, pKb2, and pKx3 values on the y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different lines representing
  pKa1, pKb2, and pKx3 values?

  2. Would you like to display markers at data points on the line chart? If so, any
  specific marker style or shape?

  3. What type of line style do you prefer (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.)?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range to better visualize the differences?

  6. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If yes, horizontal, vertical, or both?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between pKa1, pKb2, and pKx3
  values?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or specific data point labels?

  9. Do you prefer any specific layout or positioning for the legend (e.g., top, right,
  bottom)?

  10. Is there a particular style or theme (e.g., classic, modern, minimalistic) that
  you prefer for the chart?'
