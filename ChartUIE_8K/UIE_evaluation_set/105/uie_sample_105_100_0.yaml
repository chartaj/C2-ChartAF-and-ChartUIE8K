initial_prompt: I want a Box chart visualizing the stock data from 18 May'12 to 13
  Oct'21. Use annotations to highlight key data points like the highest and lowest
  closing prices. The chart should show Open, High, Low, and Close prices. Emphasize
  trends that reveal significant stock movements. Include context-relevant non-data-driven
  annotations like market conditions or major business events influencing the stock.
  Highlights in the chart should make certain data points stand out, helping viewers
  quickly grasp significant periods in Reliance's stock performance. Ensure the chart
  is visually engaging and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use for highlighting key data points?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the annotations (e.g., arrows, callouts, text
  boxes)?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, and if so, what style?

  5. Do you want to highlight different periods with background shading or patterns?

  6. Would you like to include a legend for non-data-driven annotations?

  7. Do you have any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for text elements in
  the chart?

  8. Do you want to display the Open, High, Low, and Close prices in different shapes
  (e.g., circles, squares) or stick to the default box structure?

  9. Should the x-axis labels be at specific intervals (e.g., quarterly, yearly) or
  automatic?

  10. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels'' placement and
  formatting?'
