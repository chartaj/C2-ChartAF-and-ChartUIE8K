initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing Reliance's stock data from
  18 May'12 to 13 Oct'21. I want the x-axis to represent the Date, and the y-axis
  to show the Closing prices. Make sure each point represents a daily closing price.

  2. Would you like the years to be represented by different marker shapes in addition
  to colors?

  on the chart?

  6. Do you have a specific font preference for the axis labels and legend?

  in mind?
