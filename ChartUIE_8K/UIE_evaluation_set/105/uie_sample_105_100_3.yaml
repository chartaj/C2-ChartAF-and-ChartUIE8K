initial_prompt: I need a candlestick chart for the stock data ranging from 18 May'12
  to 13 Oct'21. The chart should display daily open, high, low, and close prices using
  color codes to indicate price rises (green) and falls (red). The x-axis should represent
  the date, while the y-axis should show stock prices. Please include volume as a
  bar graph at the bottom of the candlestick chart. Make sure to incorporate this
  data accordingly to clearly visualize trends over the specified date range. Also,
  indicate any dividends and stock splits.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the candlestick chart other
  than the green for price rises and red for price falls?

  2. Would you like the volume bar graph to have a specific color or follow the same
  color scheme as the candlestick chart?

  3. How would you like the dividends and stock splits to be indicated on the chart
  (e.g., special markers, text annotations)?

  4. Do you have a particular preference for the size and aspect ratio of the chart?

  5. Are there any specific date or price labels you would like to emphasize on the
  axes?

  6. Would you like to include any grid lines or background shading to enhance readability?

  7. Is there a specific font or style you prefer for the axis labels and chart annotations?'
