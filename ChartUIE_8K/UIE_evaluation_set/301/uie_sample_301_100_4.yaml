initial_prompt: I have a dataset on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over several
  decades. Could you create an area chart using this data? The chart should show the
  trend of Carbon Dioxide (ppm) over time, with the x-axis representing the 'Year'
  and the y-axis representing 'Carbon Dioxide (ppm)'. Please ensure missing values
  are handled appropriately, and use a distinct color for the area to make the trend
  clear. Adding gridlines and a legend would also be helpful. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the area fill?

  2. Which color would you like the gridlines to be?

  3. Would you prefer the legend to be positioned in a specific part of the chart,
  such as top-right, bottom-left, etc.?

  4. How would you like the missing values to be handled? Should they be interpolated,
  left as gaps, or handled in another specific way?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to include to highlight
  key events or periods in the data?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the x-axis and y-axis labels (font size, color,
  etc.)?

  7. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Do you want to include axis titles? If yes, any specific wording for the x-axis
  and y-axis titles?

  9. Are there any specific time periods or data ranges you would like to zoom in
  on or highlight?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer the legend to be positioned at the top-right.

  4. The missing values should be interpolated.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, the title should be "Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Levels Over Time."

  8. Yes, the x-axis title should be "Year" and the y-axis title should be "Carbon
  Dioxide (ppm)."

  9. I am not sure.'
