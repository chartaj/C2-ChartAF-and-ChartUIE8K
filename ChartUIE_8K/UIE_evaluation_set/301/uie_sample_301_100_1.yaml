initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the carbon dioxide levels in
  the atmosphere from 1958 to 2017, including both raw CO2 and seasonally adjusted
  values. Highlight outliers and missing data points, as they are crucial for understanding
  data gaps and anomalies. Use text annotations to indicate significant years and
  any noticeable patterns, like major increases or decreases in CO2 levels. This will
  help in environmental research and in communicating the urgency of climate change
  issues. Ensure the visualization is clear and effectively emphasizes key data insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting outliers and
  significant patterns?

  2. Would you like specific markers for missing data points or a particular way to
  denote them?

  3. Are there specific years you believe should be annotated or emphasized in the
  chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation and placement of text annotations?

  5. Should the x-axis display both the ''Year'' and ''Month'', or would you prefer
  a more aggregated time display, such as annual data points?

  6. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like included in the chart?

  7. Would you prefer to see both raw CO2 and seasonally adjusted values together
  in one box chart, or should they be displayed separately?

  8. How detailed should the gridlines and axis scales be to improve clarity and readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Significant years like 1965, 1990, and 2015.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Annual data points would be preferable.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Display both raw CO2 and seasonally adjusted values together in one box chart.

  8. I am not sure.'
