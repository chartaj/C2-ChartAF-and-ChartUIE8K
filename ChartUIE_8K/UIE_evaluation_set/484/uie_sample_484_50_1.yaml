initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the given data, highlighting unique areas
  with distinct colors to differentiate values clearly. Include text annotations for
  specific points to underscore significant observations. Emphasize the relationship
  between 'r' and 'theta'.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the heatmap?

  positioning)?

  3. Are there any specific points or ranges you would like to highlight with text
  annotations?

  4. Would you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., square,
  rectangular)?

  5. Are there any particular labels or legends you want to include in the heatmap?

  6. Do you have any preferred scales or limits for the ''r'' and ''theta'' axes?

  7. Would you like a specific style or format for the grid lines in the heatmap?

  8. Are there any additional titles or descriptions you want on the chart to provide
  context?'
