initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset with four columns: ''r'', ''theta'', ''area'', and
  ''colors''. Each column contains numerical values, and there are no missing or unique
  value issues. I''d like to create a density plot that visualizes how the data is
  distributed, particularly focusing on the ''r'' and ''theta'' values. Please use
  the ''r'' value for the x-axis and the ''theta'' value for the y-axis. Could you
  generate a density plot that provides a clear distribution overview for these variables?
  Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the density plot?

  2. Would you like to include contour lines in the density plot?

  3. Do you have a preference for the number of bins or levels in the density plot?

  4. Should there be any specific axis labels or titles for the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred background style or grid layout for the plot?

  6. Would you like to include a legend indicating the density levels?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to add to the plot?

  8. Do you have a preferred scale for the axes (linear, log, etc.)?

  9. Would you like to add any marginal histograms to show the distribution of ''r''
  and ''theta'' individually along the sides of the plot?'
