initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the data from '484.csv'. Use the
  'r', 'theta', and 'area' columns on the y-axis to show distribution across these
  measures. Assign different colors to each data category to distinguish between them.
  This will help to analyze the spread and density of values for 'r', 'theta', and
  'area' in a single view. Ensure that the colors used are distinct to make the plot
  easily interpretable. Additionally, label the axes and include a legend for clarity.
  Aim for a visually appealing and informative graphic.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for distinguishing the different
  data categories?

  2. Would you like the plot to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. How would you prefer the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  4. Do you have any specific formatting preferences for the axis labels (e.g., font
  size, font type)?

  5. Should the plot include any additional markers or annotations for highlighting
  specific data points or ranges?

  6. Are there any particular data categories you want to emphasize more than others?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title? If so, please provide the preferred
  title text.

  8. Do you have any preference for the width and spacing of the violin plots for
  each data attribute?
