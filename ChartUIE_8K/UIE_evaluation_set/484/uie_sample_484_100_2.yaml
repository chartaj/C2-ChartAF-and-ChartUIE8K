initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot using the provided data columns: ''r'',
  ''theta'', ''area'', and ''colors''. Annotate specific data points to highlight
  their values, focusing viewer attention on these elements primarily. Implement visual
  highlights, such as changing the size or color of the markers, to emphasize important
  data points and areas with larger values. Use this visualization to effectively
  communicate the relationship between the variables, making it easy to identify patterns
  and outliers relevant to data science and analytics. Ensure all data points are
  represented accurately, with no missing values.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you want the color of the markers to represent any specific data attribute?

  3. What specific data points do you want to be annotated?

  4. How would you like the size of the markers to be determined? Should it be proportional
  to a specific data attribute such as ''area''?

  5. Are there any specific labels or legends you prefer for the axes or the color
  scale?

  6. Do you have a preference for the shape of the markers?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines in the scatter plot?

  8. Do you want a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should it be?

  9. Are there any axis limits or scales you want to be specifically set, such as
  logarithmic scales?

  10. Do you need any specific tooltips or hover effects to display additional data
  information?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the color of the markers should represent the ''colors'' attribute.

  3. Specific data points with the highest ''area'' values should be annotated.

  4. Yes, the size of the markers should be proportional to the ''area'' attribute.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, the title should be "Scatter Plot of r vs. theta with Area and Colors".

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No, I do not need specific tooltips or hover effects.
