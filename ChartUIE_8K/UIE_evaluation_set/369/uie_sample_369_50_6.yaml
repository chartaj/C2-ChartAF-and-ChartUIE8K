initial_prompt: Create a network graph visualizing air travel between major US cities.
  Use nodes for cities, edges for routes, and different colors for regions. Show passenger
  weights. Include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago. Use sample data provided.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different regions?

  2. What style or shape do you prefer for the nodes representing cities?

  3. Should the size of the nodes vary according to the number of passengers or another
  metric?

  4. What type of labels do you want on the nodes (e.g., city names, region, passenger
  count)?

  5. How should the weights of the routes be represented on the edges (e.g., thickness,
  color intensity)?

  6. Do you prefer any particular layout for the network graph (e.g., circular, force-directed,
  hierarchical)?

  7. Would you like to include any legends or annotations to explain color coding
  and edge weights?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for text labels within
  the chart?

  9. Would you like the graph to include any background maps or geographical context?

  10. Do you want to show any additional information on hover or click events on nodes/edges
  (excluding interactive elements)?
