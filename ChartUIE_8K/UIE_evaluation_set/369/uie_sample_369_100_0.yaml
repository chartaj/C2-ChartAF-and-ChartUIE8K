initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing air travel between major US cities.
  Use the "weight" column for the line values, representing the intensity of travel,
  with different lines for each "region". Highlight significant cities such as New
  York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, to draw attention to their travel weights. Add data-driven
  text annotations to these highlighted cities to display their travel weights. This
  will help in understanding the travel dynamics and regional connections among these
  major cities and provide insights into passenger movements.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different regions in the\
  \ line chart?\n2. What line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) would you prefer for\
  \ distinguishing between different regions?\n3. Would you like specific markers\
  \ (such as circles, squares) on data points for the regions? If so, please specify.\n\
  4. How would you prefer the highlighted significant cities (New York, Los Angeles,\
  \ and Chicago) to be marked (e.g., larger markers, different colors)?\n5. Do you\
  \ have any preferences for the positioning of the text annotations for the significant\
  \ cities?\n6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text\
  \ annotations?\n7. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the\
  \ line chart?\n8. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different regions\
  \ and their corresponding styles/colors?\n9. Do you have any preferences for the\
  \ axis labels and their formatting? \n10. Would you like grid lines on the chart\
  \ for better readability? If so, horizontal, vertical, or both?"
