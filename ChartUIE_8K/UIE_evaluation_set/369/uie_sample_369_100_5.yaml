initial_prompt: I have a dataset about air travel between major US cities, with columns
  like type, id, name, weight, region, source, target, and passengers. I want to create
  a histogram to visualize this data. Please create a histogram that shows the distribution
  of weights of different nodes across various regions. Use separate colors or shades
  to differentiate the regions in the histogram. This will help me understand the
  weight distribution of flights connected to different regions like East, West, and
  Midwest. Make the chart clear and easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to differentiate the
  regions?

  2. What is the title you would like for the histogram?

  3. Would you prefer labels on the axis to be horizontal, vertical, or rotated diagonally?

  4. Should we include gridlines in the histogram for better readability?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to display the exact count or percentage on top of the histogram
  bars?

  7. Do you want to display a legend to explain the colors or shades used for different
  regions?

  8. Should there be any specific order for the regions in the histogram?

  9. What bin width or range would you prefer for the weight distribution in the histogram?

  10. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the color palette.

  2. Title: "Weight Distribution of Flights Across Various Regions"

  3. Horizontal labels for the axes would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  5. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. I do not have a specific order for the regions.

  9. I do not know any specific bin width or range.

  10. I have no specific preference for the background color.'
