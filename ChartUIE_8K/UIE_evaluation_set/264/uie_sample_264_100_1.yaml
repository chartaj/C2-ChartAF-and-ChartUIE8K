initial_prompt: Create a line chart for Near-Earth Comets visualizing the orbital
  elements data over time, including parameters like 'e', 'i', 'q', and 'Q'. Use text
  annotations to highlight key comets such as '1P/Halley' and '2P/Encke'. Add visual
  highlights to emphasize significant trends or outliers. Make sure the chart helps
  in understanding the orbital characteristics and differences among multiple comets.
  Annotations should draw attention to unique features, and the overall goal is to
  make the data easily interpretable for space and astronomy enthusiasts. Ensure it
  is engaging and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to have a dark or light background?

  3. Are there any particular styles of text annotations you prefer, such as font
  size, color, or placement?

  4. Do you have a preference for the line styles (solid, dashed, etc.) for different
  parameters?

  5. Should there be a legend distinguishing the different parameters (''e'', ''i'',
  ''q'', ''Q'')?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, in which style (dotted,
  solid, etc.)?

  7. How would you like significant trends or outliers to be visually highlighted
  (e.g., different colors, bold lines, shapes)?

  8. Are there any specific intervals or ranges on the x-axis (time) that you want
  to focus on?

  9. Do you have a preferred format or style for highlighting the key comets such
  as ''1P/Halley'' and ''2P/Encke''?

  10. Would you like to include any additional elements such as a title, subtitles,
  or footnotes on the chart?'
