initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the orbital inclination (i) of
  near-Earth comets. Use color gradients to represent the range of inclinations from
  low to high. The map should highlight differences across different objects in the
  dataset, such as '1P/Halley', '2P/Encke', etc. Present data points clearly with
  the object name and corresponding inclination values. Ensure the map is visually
  intuitive to understand how the inclinations of these comets vary across the dataset
  provided. It should convey the orbital characteristics of near-Earth comets effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing the range of
  inclinations?

  2. Should the color gradient be sequential or diverging?

  3. Do you have specific labels or annotations that you would like to add to the
  map?

  4. How would you prefer the comet objects to be labeled on the map (e.g., short
  names, full names)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradient?

  6. Do you have any preference for the map''s projection type?

  7. Would you like the map to include additional geographical context, such as latitudes
  and longitudes?

  8. Are there any specific regions or sections of the map you would like to emphasize?

  9. Do you want any specific visual cues to highlight particularly high or low inclination
  values?

  10. Should the map include any statistical summary or descriptive text elements?'
