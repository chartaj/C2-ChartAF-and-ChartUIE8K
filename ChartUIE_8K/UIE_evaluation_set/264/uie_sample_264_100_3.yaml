initial_prompt: I have data on various Near-Earth comets with attributes like epoch,
  perihelion distance, inclination, aphelion distance, period, and more. I want to
  visualize this using a stacked bar chart. The chart should show each comet (like
  1P/Halley, 2P/Encke) on the X-axis, and different attributes (like 'e', 'i', 'q',
  'Q', 'P') stacked on the Y-axis. Make sure the data is clearly distinguishable by
  color coding each attribute differently. This will help me understand the comparative
  attributes of these comets easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for differentiating each attribute
  on the stacked bar chart?

  2. What should be the title of the chart?

  3. Do you want labels for each attribute on the bars or just a legend to identify
  them?

  4. Should the Y-axis have a specific scale or range, or should it be auto-scaled
  based on the data?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier comparison?

  7. Is there any specific order in which the comets should appear on the X-axis?
  For example, by name, by perihelion distance, or another attribute?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or data points you would like to emphasize
  on the chart?

  9. Should the chart include error bars or standard deviation indicators for the
  presented data?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  2. The title of the chart can be "Comparative Attributes of Near-Earth Comets."

  3. A legend to identify each attribute will be sufficient.

  4. The Y-axis can be auto-scaled based on the data.

  5. I have no specific preference for the font style and size.

  6. I would like grid lines to be displayed for easier comparison.

  7. I am not sure about the order in which the comets should appear on the X-axis.

  8. I do not have any additional annotations or data points to emphasize.

  9. I do not know if error bars or standard deviation indicators are necessary.'
