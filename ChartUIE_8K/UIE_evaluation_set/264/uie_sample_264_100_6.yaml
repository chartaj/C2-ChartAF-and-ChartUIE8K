initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for Near-Earth Comets (space-and-astronomy
  category) using the data from "264.csv". Focus on visualizing the distribution of
  comet orbital elements. Specifically, highlight the columns "e" (eccentricity),
  "i" (inclination), and "q" (perihelion distance) in separate subplots within the
  histogram. Make sure the x-axis represents the values of each parameter and the
  y-axis shows the frequency of comets with those values. Provide a clear title and
  labels for each subplot to enhance understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histograms or subplots?

  2. What bin size would you prefer for each of the histogram subplots?

  3. Do you want the histograms to have a specific range on the x-axis for each parameter?

  4. Would you like a grid to be displayed in the background of the histograms?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the titles and labels?

  6. Should the y-axis be normalized to show probability density instead of frequency?

  7. Do you want the subplots to be arranged in a specific layout (e.g., vertically
  or horizontally)?

  8. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include in the
  visualizations?

  9. Should the histograms include any special markers or indications for outliers?'
