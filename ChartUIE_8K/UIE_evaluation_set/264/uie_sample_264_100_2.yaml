initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart visualization for the Near-Earth Comets data.
  The chart should plot the semi-major axis (\(Q\)) on the x-axis, eccentricity (\(e\))
  on the y-axis, and use the period (\(P\)) to define the size of the bubbles. Additionally,
  highlight and annotate '1P/Halley', '2P/Encke', and '3D/Biela' to draw attention
  to these key comets. Remember to make the highlighted bubbles visually distinct.
  This is for an astronomy project aiming to compare the orbits and periods of these
  comets.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlighted bubbles?

  2. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., labels, tooltips)?

  3. Do you have a specific scale preference for the size of the bubbles?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  6. Do you prefer a particular background color or theme for the chart?

  7. Should the non-highlighted bubbles have a specific transparency level?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the size and color of the bubbles?'
