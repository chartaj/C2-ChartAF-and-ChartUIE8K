initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the orbital parameters of the listed
  Near-Earth Comets over time. Highlight significant epochs and their corresponding
  values, specifically focusing on eccentricity (e) and inclination (i). Annotate
  key comets to emphasize trends and anomalies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the data points to be marked on the line chart?

  3. How would you like the significant epochs to be highlighted?

  4. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If yes, how should it be positioned?

  5. Should we include gridlines for better readability? If yes, horizontal, vertical,
  or both?

  6. Are there any specific shapes or styles you prefer for annotating key comets?

  7. Would you like the axis labels to include units of measurement?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for annotations and labels?

  9. Should the chart include a title and, if so, what should it be?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the y-axis scaling, such as logarithmic
  or linear?

  11. Would you like to include any reference lines or bands to indicate key values
  or ranges on the chart?'
