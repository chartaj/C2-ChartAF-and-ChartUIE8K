initial_prompt: Create a treemap chart to visualize Near-Earth Comets. Highlight comets
  with unusual eccentricity and inclination values. Use annotations to specify the
  object names, orbital period, and MOID. The purpose is to provide a clear comparison
  of different comets' orbital characteristics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting comets with unusual
  eccentricity and inclination values?

  2. Are there any specific thresholds for eccentricity and inclination that you consider
  unusual?

  3. How would you like the annotations for object names, orbital period, and MOID
  to be displayed (e.g., always visible, visible on hover)?

  4. Would you prefer the treemap to be sorted in any particular way (e.g., by orbital
  period, by eccentricity)?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like to handle overlapping labels or annotations?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of the treemap?

  7. Are there any additional aesthetic preferences, such as font style or size for
  annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Always visible.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.'
