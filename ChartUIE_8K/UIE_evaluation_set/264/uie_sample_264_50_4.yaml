initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing 'i' (inclination) on the x-axis and
  'e' (eccentricity) on the y-axis for Near-Earth Comets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines to make it easier to read the values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific marker style (e.g., circles, squares, or triangles)
  for the data points?

  4. Should we include axis labels and titles? If so, do you have any specific text
  in mind?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, even if it is a single data series?

  9. Would you like the axes to have a specific range, or should they automatically
  fit the data?

  10. Are there any specific guidelines or standards we should follow for the data
  visualization to be more effective for your audience?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include axis labels and titles. The x-axis should be "Inclination
  (i)" and the y-axis should be "Eccentricity (e)". The title can be "Scatter Plot
  of Near-Earth Comets: Inclination vs. Eccentricity".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. No, the chart does not need a legend.

  9. The axes should automatically fit the data.
