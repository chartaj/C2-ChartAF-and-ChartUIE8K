initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the relationship between 'Object', 'e',
  'i', 'q', 'Q', and 'MOID' fields from the Near-Earth Comets data, showing how these
  parameters vary across different comet objects.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a legend to explain the color intensity?

  3. Do you want to include gridlines or borders between cells in the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include labels for the comet objects and parameters on the
  axes?

  5. Are there specific ranges or values you want to highlight within the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale used (e.g., linear, logarithmic) in the
  heatmap color intensity?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap?

  8. Should the heatmap include a title and/or axis titles? If so, do you have preferences
  for what they should be?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the comet objects to be displayed?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like a legend to explain the color intensity.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the heatmap should include labels for the comet objects and parameters on
  the axes.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, the heatmap should include a title and axis titles. The title could be "Near-Earth
  Comets Parameter Relationships" and the axis titles should be the field names.

  9. I do not know.'
