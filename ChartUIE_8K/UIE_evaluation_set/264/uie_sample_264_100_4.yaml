initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the data from the Near-Earth Comets
  dataset. Plot the inclination (i) on the x-axis and the eccentricity (e) on the
  y-axis. Each point should represent a comet. Include data labels with the comet
  names. This visualization will help analyze the relationship between the inclination
  of orbits and their eccentricities for near-Earth comets. Use the different types
  of comets listed in the 'Object' column. Add a title and labels for clarity. Use
  a distinct color for each comet type if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for the different types of
  comets?

  2. What size would you like the data points to be?

  3. How would you prefer the data labels with comet names to be displayed (e.g.,
  font size, position)?

  4. Is there a preferred aspect ratio for the plot?

  5. Do you want any specific grid lines or background style on the plot?

  6. Are there any specific markers you want to use for the scatter points?

  7. Do you have preferences for the title font style and size?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, do you have a preference for its
  position?

  9. Should there be any specific range for the x-axis (inclination) and y-axis (eccentricity)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you want included in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Please use a readable font size for the data labels, with comet names positioned
  near the points.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include a legend. I have no preference for its position.

  9. I do not have any specific range in mind.
