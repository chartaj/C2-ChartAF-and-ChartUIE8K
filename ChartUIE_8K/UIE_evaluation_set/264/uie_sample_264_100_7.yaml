initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of different orbital
  parameters of near-Earth comets. Use the columns 'e', 'i', 'w', and 'Node' to represent
  the axes and color intensities. Include labels and a legend to clearly show which
  color corresponds to each data range. Highlight any significant clusters or patterns
  that could indicate commonalities or outliers among the comets. Make sure to handle
  missing values appropriately, perhaps by using a neutral color for those data points.
  The goal is to provide a clear, comprehensive overview of the comets' orbital characteristics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to use a specific type of scale (linear, logarithmic, etc.) for
  the color intensities?

  3. Are there preferred color intensities for specific data ranges?

  4. How would you like missing values to be visually represented (e.g., neutral color,
  grey, transparent)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the labels on the axes?

  6. How detailed would you like the legend to be? Would you prefer it to show every
  range or key ranges only?

  7. Should any specific categories or values be emphasized within the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the size and layout of the heatmap?

  9. Is there a preferred format for the labels and annotations (e.g., font type,
  size, color)?'
