initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the summary data of Near-Earth Comets,
  emphasizing 'Object', 'q', 'e', and 'P'. Highlight objects with unique identifiers.
  Use annotations to display 'TP' and 'i'. Each rectangle should represent a comet,
  sized by its 'MOID' value and colored based on 'e'. Annotations should include textual
  details highlighting specific 'ref'. The purpose is to highlight orbital parameters
  and relationships visually. This will be helpful for astronomers and enthusiasts
  to quickly grasp key attributes and differences among the comets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the treemap?

  2. How would you prefer the annotations to be displayed (e.g., tooltips, labels
  inside the rectangles)?

  3. Should the comet names be displayed inside each rectangle, or should they only
  appear in annotations?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the font size and style of the text
  used in annotations?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be ordered or categorized
  within the treemap?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be in terms of the information provided?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or any additional explanatory text in the
  visualization?

  8. Do you have a preference for how to handle comets with missing values for some
  attributes?

  9. Are there any specific color or size thresholds that you would like to use for
  highlighting particular comets or attributes?

  10. Would you like any additional interactive elements, like hover effects or clickable
  regions, to reveal more details about each comet?'
