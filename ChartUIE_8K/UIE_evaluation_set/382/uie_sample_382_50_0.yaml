  the highest concentration areas?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style or formatting for the annotations of key price

  for its placement?

  4. Are there any specific price points you already know of that you want to be annotated?

  5. Do you have a preferred kernel (e.g., Gaussian, Epanechnikov) for the density
  estimation?

  6. Should the x-axis have specific tick marks or labels for price ranges?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the plot to improve readability, and if so, do you
  have any styling preferences for them?

  8. Are there any particular trends or patterns within the ''price'' data that you
  are specifically interested in highlighting?
