initial_prompt: I would like to create a Violin plot to visualize the distribution
  of the 'price' column from the dataset. This dataset appears to be related to a
  business context, possibly reflecting product prices or purchase amounts. I am interested
  in seeing the distribution and spread of the prices. The Violin plot should showcase
  the density of the data points, especially highlighting where the prices are concentrated
  and the variability in the prices. Since there are no missing values, the plot should
  use all available data points. Please ensure the chart is properly labeled for clarity.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the violin plot?\n2.\
  \ Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot?\n3. Should the plot include\
  \ a title, and if so, what should it be?\n4. Do you want any specific labels or\
  \ annotations on the plot for key data points?\n5. Are there any particular font\
  \ styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?\n6. Would you like to display\
  \ the median and quartiles on the violin plot? \n7. Should the y-axis be scaled\
  \ to fit the data tightly, or do you have specific axis limits in mind?\n8. Do you\
  \ prefer a horizontal or vertical violin plot?\n9. Would you like to add any specific\
  \ notes or a legend to the plot?\n10. Do you have any preferences for the thickness\
  \ or style of the plot lines?"
