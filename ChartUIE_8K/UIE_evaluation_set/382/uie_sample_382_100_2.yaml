initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the 'price' data to visualize its
  distribution for the business dataset related to price and the number of purchasers.
  The chart should include data-driven text annotations highlighting the quartiles,
  median, and any outliers. Highlights should modify the appearance of outliers to
  make them stand out visually. The purpose is to identify the central tendency, spread,
  and any anomalies in the pricing data to better analyze purchasing trends. Ensure
  the annotations and highlights draw attention to key areas and provide a clear interpretation
  of the data distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the quartiles,
  median, and outliers?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be represented with a specific shape or symbol?

  3. Should the box chart include a title? If yes, please specify your preferred title.

  4. Do you have a preferred color palette for the overall chart?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines? If yes, should they be light or prominent?

  7. Would you like to include a legend in the chart?

  8. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the box chart?

  9. Should the chart include axis labels and, if so, do you have preferences for
  their text?

  10. Would you like to specify any particular style for the box edges and whiskers
  (e.g., solid, dashed, thick)?'
