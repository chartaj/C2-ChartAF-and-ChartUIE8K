initial_prompt: Create a Dumbbell chart to visualize Bundesliga teams' performance
  based on their betting odds and match outcomes. Use 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'FTHG',
  'FTAG', 'B365H', 'B365A', 'MaxH', 'MaxA', 'AvgH', 'AvgA' for plotting. The chart
  should show Home and Away teams along the y-axis and goals scored (Home vs Away)
  on the x-axis. Use separate markers for bet odds and match results, connecting lines
  between home and away data points to see discrepancies between expected and actual
  performance. Highlight data points with different colors for home and away teams
  for clarity.
questions: "1. What color scheme would you prefer for home and away teams to ensure\
  \ clarity in the chart?\n2. Do you have any specific preferences for marker shapes\
  \ or sizes for representing betting odds and match results?\n3. Would you like to\
  \ include any specific annotations or labels on the chart to highlight key points?\n\
  4. Are there any specific teams or matches you would like to highlight or focus\
  \ on?\n5. Do you have a preference for the scale type of the x-axis (linear, logarithmic,\
  \ etc.)?\n6. Would you like to add a legend to differentiate between home and away\
  \ markers and lines for betting odds and match outcomes?\n7. How would you prefer\
  \ the discrepancies between expected and actual performances to be displayed? \n\
  8. Do you want to display the exact values of goals scored and betting odds on the\
  \ chart?\n9. Are there any other specific visual elements or features you want to\
  \ include in the chart?"
