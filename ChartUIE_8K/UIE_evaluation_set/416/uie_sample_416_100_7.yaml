initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the Bundesliga points per match
  based on the given dataset. I want the x-axis to represent each team's name (HomeTeam
  and AwayTeam), and the y-axis to represent the total points they earned in each
  match (Home Win = 3 points, Draw = 1 point, Away Win = 3 points). Aggregate the
  data to show the total points each team has earned. Use different colors to distinguish
  between home and away points. Ensure to include a legend and proper labels on the
  axes for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the home and away points
  bars?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed in a particular order, such as by total
  points or alphabetically by team name?

  3. Should the home and away bars for each team be grouped together or displayed
  separately?

  4. What specific font type or size do you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement on the chart?

  6. Should there be any specific gridlines or background shading included in the
  chart?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or data labels included on the bars?'
