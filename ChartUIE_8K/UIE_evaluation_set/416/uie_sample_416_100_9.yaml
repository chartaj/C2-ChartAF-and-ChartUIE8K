initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart that visualizes Bundesliga teams'
  points per match for the specified dates. Use 'HomeTeam' and 'AwayTeam' as categories
  on the x-axis, and plot 'FTHG' and 'FTAG' for home and away goals respectively,
  showing them side-by-side for each match. Ensure that the columns are color-coded
  for easy distinction. This will help in comparing the performance of home and away
  teams across different matches. Add a legend to indicate which colors represent
  home and away goals. Thank you!

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels showing the exact values of goals\
  \ scored?\n3. Is there a specific date range you want the chart to focus on?\n4.\
  \ Do you have a preferred order for the teams on the x-axis, or should they be sorted\
  \ by date or another criterion?\n5. What title would you like for the chart? \n\
  6. Do you want any specific gridlines or markers on the chart?\n7. Should the legend\
  \ be placed at a specific position on the chart, such as top, bottom, right, or\
  \ left?\n8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to be used for\
  \ the text in the chart?\n9. Would you like to include any additional information\
  \ or annotations in the chart?"
