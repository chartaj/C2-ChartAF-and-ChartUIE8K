initial_prompt: Visualize Bundesliga match outcomes using a diverging bar chart. Show
  wins, draws, and losses for home and away teams with color-coded bars. Each bar
  represents a teamâ€™s performance, diverging in opposite directions for home and away
  results. Include text annotations for standout performances (e.g., highest wins,
  significant losses). Highlight league leaders in a distinct color to emphasize their
  dominance. This will help identify patterns and performance trends. The practical
  purpose is to quickly compare team performances across match dates, assisting fans
  and analysts in understanding team strengths and weaknesses.
