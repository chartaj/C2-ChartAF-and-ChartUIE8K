initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing the Bundesliga points per match.
  Use data points for different games with features like 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', and
  'FTR' to show results such as victories, draws, and losses. Include text annotations
  to highlight specific outlier matches or significant games. Use different colors
  or sizes to highlight the match outcomes (e.g., home win, away win, draw) to make
  them stand out. This will help in visually analyzing performance trends and patterns
  in the Bundesliga season. Include labels for better context and easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting match outcomes?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or labels for any particular matches?

  3. Should the size of data points vary based on the match outcome or any other variable?

  4. Do you want the X and Y axes to represent specific variables, and if so, which
  ones?

  5. Is there a specific range for the axes that you want to focus on?

  6. Would you like any grid lines or reference lines (such as an average line) to
  be included?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and annotations?

  8. Should the data points be interactive with hover-over information, or should
  all relevant data be displayed directly on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific titles or legends you would like to include?

  10. Are there other specific games or teams you want to highlight apart from the
  significant outlier matches?'
