initial_prompt: Create a line chart to predict students' dropout and academic success
  based on the provided education dataset. Highlight trends in 'Curricular units 1st
  sem (enrolled)', 'Curricular units 1st sem (approved)', and 'Curricular units 1st
  sem (grade)'. Annotate key data points where significant performance changes occur.
  Use different colors for 'Dropout' and 'Graduate' targets to help visualize their
  academic progress. Adding text annotations for extreme values will help focus attention
  on those particular data points, aiding in identifying patterns leading to dropout
  or success. This will serve as a practical tool in educational performance analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different target groups
  (''Dropout'' and ''Graduate'')?

  2. How would you like to differentiate the lines for ''Curricular units 1st sem
  (enrolled)'', ''Curricular units 1st sem (approved)'', and ''Curricular units 1st
  sem (grade)''? (e.g., different line styles like solid, dashed, dotted)

  3. Would you like any specific markers on the lines to indicate data points? If
  yes, please specify.

  4. Do you prefer any particular text size or font for the annotations?

  5. Should the chart have grid lines, and if so, in which style (major, minor, both)?

  6. Are there any specific colors or styles you would like to use for the text annotations
  highlighting extreme values and key data points?

  7. Would you like a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please provide the
  text.

  8. Do you have any preference for the position of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  9. Should the X-axis or Y-axis have specific labels or units of measurement?

  10. Is there a specific order or hierarchy you would like the data attributes to
  follow in the visualization?

answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different line styles would be good, maybe solid for ''enrolled'', dashed for
  ''approved'', and dotted for ''grade''.

  3. Yes, please use markers on the data points, but I donâ€™t have a specific type
  in mind.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Both major and minor grid lines would be helpful.

  6. I do not have specific colors or styles in mind for the annotations.

  7. Yes, title: "Predicting Student Dropout and Success", subtitle: "Analysis of
  Curricular Units Performance".

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Labels for the X-axis as "Semesters" and the Y-axis as "Performance Metrics".

  10. I do not know.'
