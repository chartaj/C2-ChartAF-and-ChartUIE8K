initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different
  features and the target variable in predicting students' dropout and academic success.
  Include features like Marital status, Course, Mother's qualification, Father's occupation,
  Tuition fees up to date, Age at enrollment, Curricular units (both semesters), Unemployment
  rate, Inflation rate, and GDP. Highlight strong correlations and differences that
  can help identify key factors influencing dropout rates and academic success.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include a legend to interpret the correlation values? If yes,
  where should it be positioned?

  3. Should the correlation values be displayed directly on the heatmap cells?

  4. Do you prefer any specific range or threshold to highlight strong correlations?

  5. How do you want to handle missing values in the dataset (if any)?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout orientation (e.g., vertical or horizontal) for
  the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a legend. I do not have a specific preference for its position.

  3. Yes, please display the correlation values directly on the heatmap cells.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
