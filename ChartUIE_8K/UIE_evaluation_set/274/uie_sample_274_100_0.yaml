initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the data for predicting students'
  dropout and academic success. Highlight countries based on nationality and dropout
  rates, using color intensity to indicate dropout rates. Add text annotations for
  specific countries with high dropout rates to draw attention to them. Ensure the
  map distinguishes between different success metrics, like graduation rates. The
  purpose is to easily identify patterns and hot spots related to dropout and success
  across different nationalities, which can help in targeting interventions to improve
  academic outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for representing dropout rates
  and success metrics on the map?

  2. Do you have any specific countries you want to ensure are annotated or highlighted
  on the map?

  3. How would you like success metrics (e.g., graduation rates) to be distinguished
  on the map (e.g., different color gradients, symbols, etc.)?

  4. Is there a particular map projection or geographic region focus you prefer?

  5. Do you want any additional contextual information (e.g., population, GDP) to
  be included or overlaid on the map?

  6. How would you prefer to differentiate between dropout and success rates visually
  (e.g., different map layers, side-by-side maps)?

  7. Are there specific thresholds for dropout rates at which you''d like annotations
  to be triggered?

  8. Do you have any specific text formatting preferences for the annotations (e.g.,
  font size, color, style)?

  9. Are there any legends or keys you would prefer to be included or formatted in
  a particular way on the map?'
