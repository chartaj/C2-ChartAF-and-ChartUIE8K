initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualization for the Traveler Trip Dataset.
  The chart should display the average accommodation cost by traveler nationality.
  Each bar should represent a different nationality with the height of the bar corresponding
  to the average accommodation cost. This will help us compare how much travelers
  from different nationalities spend on accommodations during their trips. Ensure
  the chart clearly labels each nationality and includes the cost values for better
  interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Should the cost values be displayed at the top of each bar?

  4. Do you have a specific layout preference for the x-axis labels (horizontal, vertical,
  angled)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, or is it unnecessary given the context?

  6. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you have a preference for font style and size for the labels and title?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specific scale or range, or should it adjust automatically
  based on the data?

  9. Do you want any additional annotations or notes on the chart to highlight specific
  insights?

  10. Is there any specific way you would like to handle nationalities with missing
  accommodation costs?'
