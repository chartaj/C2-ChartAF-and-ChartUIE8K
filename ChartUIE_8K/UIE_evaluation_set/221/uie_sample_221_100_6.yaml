initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map illustrating travel destinations by traveler
  nationality from the Traveler Trip Dataset. Use the 'Traveler nationality' for the
  geographic regions and 'Destination' counts to represent the data on the map. Ensure
  the map highlights the frequency of trips to various destinations based on traveler
  nationality. Additionally, color-code the map to differentiate the popularity of
  destinations among different nationalities. The result should visually depict how
  travelers from diverse nationalities prefer specific travel destinations, facilitating
  insights into travel trends. Ensure it's easy to interpret for travel agencies and
  tourism boards.
