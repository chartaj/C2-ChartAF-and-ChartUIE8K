initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between different variables
  in the automobile dataset, particularly focusing on price, horsepower, and enginesize.
  The heatmap should reflect how these features interact with each other and affect
  the car prices. Use the columns like 'price', 'horsepower', 'enginesize', 'curbweight',
  'compressionratio', 'citympg', and 'highwaympg'. Make sure to use a color gradient
  to show the strength of the correlations, where darker shades represent stronger
  correlations. Additionally, include labels and a color bar legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  2. What size and dimensions would you prefer for the heatmap?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels on the heatmap?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap? If so, what style?

  5. Do you want the correlation values to be shown on the heatmap cells?

  6. Is there a specific range or limit that you want for the color bar legend?

  7. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the variables in the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or additional information to the heatmap?

  9. Do you have a preferred title or heading for the heatmap?

  10. Are there any specific software or tools you prefer for creating the heatmap?'
