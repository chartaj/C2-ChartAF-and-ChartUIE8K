initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of car prices from
  the automobiles data. Highlight the bins corresponding to luxury cars by changing
  their color to dark blue. Include data-driven text annotations for the average and
  median prices to emphasize these key statistics. The histogram should help identify
  price ranges most common within the dataset, aiding in car price prediction through
  multiple linear regression. Use a clear title and labeled axes to contextualize
  the data, ensuring comprehension at first glance. Include non-data annotations to
  provide additional context.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific range of car prices that define ''luxury cars''
  for highlighting?

  2. What specific non-data annotations would you like to include for additional context?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the histogram besides dark
  blue for luxury car bins?

  4. Do you prefer a certain bin width or number of bins for the histogram?

  5. What level of detail would you like for the data-driven text annotations (e.g.,
  decimal places for average and median prices)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the title and axis labels of the histogram?

  7. Should the histogram include grid lines for easier reference of the data distribution?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?'
answers: '1. Luxury cars are typically defined as those priced above $50,000.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Average and median prices can be rounded to the nearest whole number without
  decimal places.

  6. Title: "Distribution of Car Prices in the Automobile Dataset." Axis labels: "Car
  Price ($)" for the x-axis and "Frequency" for the y-axis.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
