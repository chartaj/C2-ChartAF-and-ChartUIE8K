initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features
  and car prices from the provided data. Highlight strong correlations to understand
  key price influencers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a specific color gradient to represent the strength of the correlations?

  3. Would you like to display the correlation coefficients on the heatmap cells?

  4. Is there a specific threshold for correlation values that should be highlighted?

  5. How would you like to handle categorical variablesâ€”should they be encoded or
  excluded?

  6. Do you prefer any particular size or dimensions for the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Would you like to annotate specific cells or values on the heatmap?

  9. Should we include labels for both axes to clearly identify the features?

  10. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and annotations?

  11. Do you prefer the heatmap to be presented with a specific background color or
  style?'
