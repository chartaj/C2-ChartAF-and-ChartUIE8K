initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the average car price based on the
  fuel type (gas and diesel). Use the car price data within the file. This will help
  me understand how the price varies with different fuel types and whether gas or
  diesel cars are more expensive on average. Label the y-axis with "Average Price"
  and the x-axis with "Fuel Type". Include the number of cars sampled for each fuel
  type. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the bars representing gas
  and diesel cars?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for reference?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you want for the labels and titles?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend, or is labeling the bars sufficient?

  6. Do you prefer to display the number of cars sampled as text annotations on the
  bars or in a separate part of the chart?

  7. Is there any specific order you prefer for displaying fuel types on the x-axis
  (e.g., gas first, then diesel)?

  8. Do you want any additional stylistic elements or themes applied to the chart
  (e.g., minimalist, corporate, vibrant)?'
