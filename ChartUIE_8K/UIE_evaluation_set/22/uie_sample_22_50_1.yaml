initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize car price predictions using multiple
  linear regression. Highlight car bodies and annotate high-priced models to draw
  attention. Ensure all car attributes, like fuel type and engine size, are represented.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different car bodies?

  4. Should there be a legend to explain the car attributes like fuel type and engine
  size?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  6. Do you want any tooltips or hover text to provide additional details for each
  section?

  7. Should the treemap include any filtering options by car attributes (e.g., only
  showing specific fuel types)?

  8. Would you like the background to be plain or have a specific style (e.g., gradient,
  pattern)?

  9. Is there a preferred ordering for the car bodies in the treemap?

  10. Are there any additional visual elements you would like to include, such as
  borders or shadows around the sections?'
