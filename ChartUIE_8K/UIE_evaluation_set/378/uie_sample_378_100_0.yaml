initial_prompt: Create a Sunburst chart to visualize the 2022 World Cup matches from
  the Round of 16 to the Final. Highlight Argentinaâ€™s path to winning and annotate
  key matches like the Final, Semi-finals, and Quarter-finals with scores. Use different
  colors for each round to distinguish their importance and make it visually engaging.

  moments, such as penalty shootouts, to provide deeper context.
