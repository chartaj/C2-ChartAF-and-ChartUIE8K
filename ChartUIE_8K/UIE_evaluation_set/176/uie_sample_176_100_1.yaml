initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of Total Revenue from
  the Online Sales Dataset for a popular marketplace. Highlight specific product categories
  (Electronics, Home Appliances, Clothing) to emphasize their sales performance. Annotate
  key data points such as maximum and average revenue to draw attention. This will
  help identify revenue trends and performance differences between regions and payment
  methods. Additionally, use color-coding to distinguish between different regions
  to visually interpret regional sales distribution better. Make annotations clear
  to understand the revenue patterns without overwhelming the viewers with too much
  detail.
