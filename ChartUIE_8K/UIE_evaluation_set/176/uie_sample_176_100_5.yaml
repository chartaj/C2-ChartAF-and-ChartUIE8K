initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the Online Sales Dataset -
  Popular Marketplace Data. The x-axis should represent the 'Date' and the y-axis
  will show 'Total Revenue'. Include different lines for each 'Product Category' to
  compare their sales revenue over time. This will help us understand trends and patterns
  in the sales revenue of various product categories. Ensure the chart includes a
  legend for clarity. Use different colors for each product category line to make
  the chart easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for the different
  product category lines?

  2. Would you like to include data labels for specific points on the lines? If so,
  which points?

  3. Do you have a preferred date format to be used on the x-axis?

  4. Should the x-axis show every date, or would you prefer to display major time
  intervals (e.g., monthly, quarterly)?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability? If so, should they
  be on both axes?

  6. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the chart? If so, what should it
  be?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font type or size for the text elements in the chart
  (e.g., axis labels, legend)?

  8. Are there any particular annotations or reference lines you want to include to
  highlight specific events or trends?'

  6. Yes, title: "Sales Revenue Trends by Product Category" and subtitle: "Comparative
  Analysis Over Time"

  7. I am not sure.
