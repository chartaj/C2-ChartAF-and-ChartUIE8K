initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the height distribution by country
  and gender from the provided data. Each point on the scatter plot should represent
  an individual's height, categorized by country and color-coded by gender. Add text
  annotations for data points representing the median height for each gender within
  each country. This will emphasize key statistics while allowing viewers to understand
  height variations across different demographics and regions. Also, highlight the
  tallest and shortest individuals in the dataset with distinct colors to draw attention
  to the extremes. Ensure the graph is clear and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating genders?

  2. Would you like specific symbols or shapes to represent different genders?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for median heights to be styled (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  4. Do you prefer individual data points to have transparency to better see overlapping
  points?

  5. Is there a specific way you want the axes to be labeled or formatted (e.g., title,
  units)?

  6. Are there any specific grid lines or background styling preferences?

  7. How would you like the extremes (tallest and shortest individuals) to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific colors, shapes)?

  8. Would you like a legend to explain color-coding and symbols used in the chart?

  9. Is there a specific range for the height axis that you prefer to use?

  10. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or notes on the
  chart?'
