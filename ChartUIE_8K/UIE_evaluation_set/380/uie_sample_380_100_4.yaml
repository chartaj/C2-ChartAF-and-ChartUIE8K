initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of gender within
  each country using the data provided. The chart should show the percentage of males
  and females across different countries to provide a clear comparison. Use the 'Country'
  column for segmentation and the 'Gender' column for the categorical distribution.
  The data is health-related, and the chart should effectively illustrate the gender
  demographics by each region for better insight into the population structure. Use
  different colors for males and females to differentiate them easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for males and females in the
  pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display data labels (e.g., percentages, actual values)
  on each segment?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend? If yes, where would you like it positioned
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart
  (e.g., title, labels, legend)?

  7. Do you want each country''s pie chart to be displayed separately, or combined
  into a single chart with segments for each country?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines or axis labels, or would you prefer a cleaner,
  minimalistic look?'
