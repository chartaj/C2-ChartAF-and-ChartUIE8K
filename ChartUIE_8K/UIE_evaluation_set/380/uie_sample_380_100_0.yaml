initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the height distribution by country
  and gender. Use the provided data set to plot height values on the Y-axis and differentiate
  between countries and genders using different colors and line styles. Include text
  annotations for significant height values to draw attention to notable data points.
  Added highlights should emphasize differences between countries and genders. The
  chart should convey health-related insights, focusing on how height varies across
  different populations. Ensure the chart is visually clear and easy to interpret,
  aiding in the understanding of height variations for health analysis.
