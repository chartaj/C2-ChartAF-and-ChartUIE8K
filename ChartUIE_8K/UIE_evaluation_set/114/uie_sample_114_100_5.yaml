initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart comparing European Ski Resorts. Use 'Resort'
  on the X-axis and stack 'BeginnerSlope', 'IntermediateSlope', and 'DifficultSlope'
  on the Y-axis. Include values from 'HighestPoint' and 'TotalSlope'. Color code the
  slopes for clear differentiation. Add a legend for the slopes. Use data from '../Extra_datas/data/114.csv'.
  This will help visualize the distribution of slope difficulties across different
  resorts in various countries. Ensure the chart is easy to read and informative for
  skiing enthusiasts planning their next trip. Include titles and labels for clarity.

  especially if the names are lengthy?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for easier reading of the
  values? If so, in which color and style?
