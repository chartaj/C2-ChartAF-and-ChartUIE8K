initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the day pass prices for adults across
  different ski resorts in Europe. Highlight Austria and Andorra resorts to emphasize
  price differences. Use text annotations to show specific prices for the highest
  and lowest points in the data. Include non-data-driven annotations for context about
