initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to compare the distribution of ski slopes and lifts
  across European ski resorts, highlighting resorts with night skiing ability and
  snowparks. Utilize given annotations for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to group the heatmap by countries or show all resorts individually?

  3. How would you prefer night skiing and snowparks to be highlighted - through color,
  symbols, or another method?

  4. Do you want annotations to display detailed information or just labels for high-level
  insights?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the colors and symbols used?

  6. Is there a particular orientation (horizontal or vertical) you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific resorts or countries you want to focus on in the heatmap?

  8. Do you need the data values to be displayed within the heatmap cells, or should
  it be color-coded only?

  9. What level of detail do you want in the heatmap - aggregate data or detailed
  for each resort?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or context in the annotations
  besides highlighting night skiing and snowparks?'
