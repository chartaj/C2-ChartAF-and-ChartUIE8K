initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart of European Ski Resorts focusing on TotalSlope,
  BeginnerSlope, IntermediateSlope, and DifficultSlope. Annotate key points like peaks
  and valleys in slopes. Highlight resorts with the highest and lowest TotalSlope.
  The visualization should help compare slope difficulties across different resorts,
  showing how they vary within a country. We aim to understand the distribution of
  slope types and assist skiers in selecting resorts based on their skill levels.
  Data categories: Resort, Country, Slope types. Highlighting and annotations will
  emphasize key differences and guide selections effectively.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different slope types?

  2. Would you like the resort names to be displayed directly on the chart or in a
  legend?

  3. Do you prefer specific styles for highlighting the highest and lowest TotalSlope
  resorts (e.g., different colors, markers)?

  4. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or focus on?

  5. How would you like key points (peaks and valleys) to be annotated (e.g., labels,
  markers)?

  6. Do you prefer a specific line style or thickness for the chart?

  7. Are there any additional elements you would like included in the chart (e.g.,
  gridlines, background shading for different countries)?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitles, and if so, what should
  they be?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the resort names to be displayed directly on the chart.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include a title and subtitles. Title: "Comparison of Slope Difficulties
  Across European Ski Resorts." Subtitles: "Total Slope Lengths" and "Distribution
  of Beginner, Intermediate, and Difficult Slopes."'
