initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the provided dataset of European ski
  resorts. Focus on visualizing the distribution of 'DayPassPriceAdult' to understand
  the variation in prices. Make sure to include labels for the x-axis and y-axis,
  and a suitable title for the chart. Use bins to categorize the day pass prices and
  display the frequency of resorts within each price range. This will help analyze
  how many resorts fall into different price categories and identify any price trends
  among the resorts. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. What color would you prefer for the bars in the histogram?

  3. Do you want to include gridlines in the chart?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you would like for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Should the x-axis labels display the price ranges (e.g., "$20-$30", "$30-$40")
  or just the bin midpoints?

  6. Do you have a preference for the layout of the chart (e.g., portrait or landscape
  orientation)?

  7. Should the bars be displayed with a specific width or should they be auto-adjusted
  based on the number of bins?

  8. Would you like to add a legend or any additional annotations on the chart?'
