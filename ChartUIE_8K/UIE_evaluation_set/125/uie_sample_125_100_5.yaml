initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for the Pima Indians Diabetes Database that
  shows the distribution of the 'Glucose' levels. Make sure the x-axis represents
  the Glucose values, and the y-axis represents the number of occurrences. This will
  help in visualizing the frequency of different glucose levels among the participants.
  Also, please label the axes appropriately and include a title for the chart that
  mentions 'Pima Indians Diabetes Data'. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the histogram bars?

  2. Would you like specific ranges or bins for the glucose levels on the x-axis?

  3. Should the histogram display a rug plot or density curve in addition to the bars?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Would you like to include annotations or markers for certain glucose level thresholds?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, even if there''s only one series of data?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart, and if so, in what style (solid, dashed,
  etc.)?

  8. Is there a specific background color or style you prefer for the chart?

  9. Would you like a secondary y-axis to display any additional information?

  10. Should the histogram''s bars have borders, and if so, in which color and thickness?'
