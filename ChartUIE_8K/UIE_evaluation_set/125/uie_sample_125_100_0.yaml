initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing key metrics from the Pima Indians
  Diabetes Database, focusing on the health context. Use different colors to represent
  the 'Outcome' category for each metric to highlight diabetic versus non-diabetic
  individuals. Include text annotations to showcase values of 'BMI', 'Glucose', and
  'Age'. Use highlights to emphasize significantly higher or lower metrics across
  the stacked bars. This helps in quickly comparing health factors between diabetic
  and non-diabetic groups, drawing attention to critical areas such as high glucose
  or BMI values related to diabetes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing diabetic and
  non-diabetic groups?

  2. Would you like the text annotations to display exact numerical values or percentages?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like significantly higher or lower metrics to be highlighted (e.g.,
  bold text, different colors, icons)?

  5. Should the y-axis be standardized across all metrics, or should each metric have
  its own scale?

  6. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the stacked bar chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the labeling of the axes or legends?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Exact numerical values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Different colors.

  5. Each metric should have its own scale.

  6. Vertical orientation.

  7. I do not know.'
