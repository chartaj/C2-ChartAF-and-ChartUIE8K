initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of startup
  funding in India. Use the "Amount in USD" column for the x-axis and frequency for
  the y-axis. Include text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest funding
  amounts. Use color highlights to distinguish between different investment types.

  labels and legends for better comprehension. Thank you!
