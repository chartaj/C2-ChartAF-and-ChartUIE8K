initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the Indian Startup Funding data trends
  over time. Emphasize "Amount in USD" versus "Date dd/mm/yyyy." Use text annotations
  to highlight significant funding events, such as the highest and lowest investments,
  and note the most frequent investment types. Apply highlights to differentiate between
  various Industry Verticals and Cities. The goal is to provide a clear, engaging
  view of investment trends and key milestones in the startup ecosystem. This will
  help identify patterns and critical points in funding activities within the Indian
  startup landscape.
