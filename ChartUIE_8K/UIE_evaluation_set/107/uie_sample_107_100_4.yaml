initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the Indian Startup Funding data.
  Plot ''Date dd/mm/yyyy'' on the x-axis and ''Amount in USD'' on the y-axis. Differentiate
  the points by ''City Location'' using different colors. This plot should help identify
  trends over time and any potential funding hotspots across different cities. Size
  the markers by the amount of missing values in ''Industry Vertical'', indicating
  data quality for informed decision-making. Include a legend to explain the color
  coding of cities. Use an informative title: "Indian Startup Funding Trends and City-wise
  Distribution".'
questions: '1. What color palette or specific colors would you prefer to differentiate
  the cities?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the size range of the markers?

  3. How detailed would you like the legend to be? Should it include any additional
  information besides city names and marker sizes?

  4. Is there a specific date format you prefer on the x-axis (e.g., month/year)?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the title and axis
  labels?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the plot? If so, any preference for their style
  (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the markers (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to see on the chart?'
