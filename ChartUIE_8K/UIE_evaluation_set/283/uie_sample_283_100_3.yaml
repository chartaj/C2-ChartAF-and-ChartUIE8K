initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize trends based on the dataset provided,
  especially considering elements like the "Date_of_marriage" and the "Divorce_date".
  I'd like to see trends across the age of the partners ("Age_partner_man" and "Age_partner_woman"),
  and their "Monthly_income". Could you also include the number of "Num_Children"
  as another line on the chart? This visualization should help in understanding any
  correlation between these variables over time. Please focus on the changes before
  and after marriage, residency details, and income variations. Include zodiac signs
  for additional insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used in the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for different variables
  to distinguish them better?

  3. Do you want to include markers (e.g., dots or squares) on data points along the
  lines?

  4. Is there a specific date format you prefer (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD)?

  5. Do you require a separate legend for each line or a combined one?

  6. Should the x-axis be continuous, or would you prefer segmented time periods (e.g.,
  monthly, yearly)?

  7. Would you like to highlight specific dates or events on the chart (e.g., marriage
  date, divorce date)?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout for the chart (e.g., portrait, landscape)?

  9. Are there any annotations or notes you would like to add to the chart for important
  observations?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to have gridlines for better readability, and if
  so, in which directions (horizontal, vertical, both)?'
