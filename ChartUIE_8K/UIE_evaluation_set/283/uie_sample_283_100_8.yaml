initial_prompt: I need a geographic heatmap visualizing the marital and divorce data
  in Mexico. Use the data format to show where divorces are more frequent, focusing
  on "Residence_municipality_partner_man" and "Residence_federal_partner_man" for
  men, and similar data for women. Highlight income levels and occupations of divorced
  partners, incorporating missing data if relevant. Ensure prominent areas show clearer
  heat intensities based on the "Divorce_date". Keep it easy to interpret while incorporating
  zodiac information linked to the "DOB_partner_man" and "DOB_partner_woman". Make
  it detailed enough to reflect interesting trends by region.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap to represent
  divorce frequencies?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or labels on the heatmap for easier interpretation?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the geographic boundaries (e.g., municipal
  or federal) to be highlighted more prominently?

  4. How would you like the income levels and occupations to be represented on the
  heatmap (e.g., via color gradients, symbols)?

  5. Is there a specific way you want the zodiac information to be integrated into
  the visualization?

  6. Would you prefer the heatmap to be divided into discrete regions or have a continuous
  gradient?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the hierarchy and arrangement of data attributes
  on the map (e.g., which layers should be shown on top)?

  8. Are there any specific geographic regions you want to be focused on or highlighted
  more in the visualization?

  9. Would you like to include any trend lines or markers for specific time periods
  based on the "Divorce_date"?

  10. How detailed would you like the heatmap to be in terms of the granularity of
  regions (e.g., detailed down to individual municipalities or broader regions)?'
