initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the monthly
  income of both partners before divorce. Highlight data points where the woman's
  occupation is 'JUBILADA' and the man's employment status is 'OBRERO'. Use text annotations
  to display the ages of both partners at their divorce date for highlighted points.
  The chart's purpose is to analyze income patterns among divorced partners considering
  their professions and age. This would help in understanding if specific occupations
  or ages correlate with income levels during divorces. Ensure the chart is clear
  and informative for astrology-related insights.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing the highlighted
  data points versus the general data points?

  2. Do you have a preferred background color or grid style for the scatter plot?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for ages to be displayed (e.g., font
  size, color, position)?

  4. Would you like the axis titles and labels to use any specific font or style?

  5. Are there any specific markers or shapes you want to use for the points in the
  scatter plot?

  6. Do you want any particular legend style or placement on the chart?

  7. Should the data points'' size be fixed, or do you want them to vary based on
  another attribute (e.g., income)?

  8. Do you prefer a particular style for the chart''s title and subtitles (e.g.,
  bold, italic, color)?

  9. Would you like any trend lines or regression lines added to the scatter plot
  to emphasize correlation?

  10. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to include to
  provide more context to the audience?'
