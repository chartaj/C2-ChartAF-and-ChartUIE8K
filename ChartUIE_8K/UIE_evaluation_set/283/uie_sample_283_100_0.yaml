initial_prompt: Create a histogram using the provided divorce data to visualize the
  distribution of Marriage_duration and Age_partner_man. Use text annotations to highlight
  key statistics, like the mean and median marriage duration and the most common age
  ranges. Apply highlights to emphasize differences across age groups. The purpose
  is to identify patterns or correlations between marriage durations and partner ages.
  This will help in understanding any trends in the demographics related to divorces.
  The context of the horoscope and astrology data could be used to analyze any astrological
  patterns in divorces.
