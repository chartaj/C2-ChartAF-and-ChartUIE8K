initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the age distribution of men
  and women at the time of divorce. The x-axis should represent the 'Type_of_divorce'
  (Necesario, Voluntario), and the y-axis should show the 'Age_partner_man' and 'Age_partner_woman'.
  Separate the data for men and women into different boxes for each type of divorce,
  and make sure to include outliers. This will help us better understand how age varies
  between different types of divorces among different genders.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or palette
  to differentiate between men and women in the box chart?

  2. Would you prefer a specific title for the chart, or should I use a default title
  like ''Age Distribution at the Time of Divorce''?

  3. Are there any specific preferences for the styling of the x-axis and y-axis labels
  and titles?

  4. Would you like to include additional annotations or labels for median values
  and quartiles on the boxes?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout or arrangement of the boxes
  within each category on the x-axis?

  6. Are there specific preferences regarding the handling or displaying of outliers
  in the box chart?

  7. Would you like any grid lines or reference lines to be included in the chart
  background for better readability?'
