initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart to visualize the summarized details from
  the divorce data. Include key variables such as Age, Monthly Income, and Education
  Level for both partners. Highlight the differences between the man and woman in
  each case. Use data-driven text annotations to note specific values and any significant
  disparities. The chart should emphasize aspects like Occupation and Marriage Duration
  as well, drawing attention to unique patterns. This will help analyze the correlation
  between these factors in divorce cases. The visualization should clearly convey
  the impact of various factors on marriage stability.
