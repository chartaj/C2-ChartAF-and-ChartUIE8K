initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of the types
  of divorces (`Type_of_divorce`) from the given data. I would like to see the proportions
  of "Necesario" and "Voluntario" divorces based on the provided examples. Also, include
  labels for each segment showing the percentage each type represents. This will help
  me understand the relative frequencies of the different divorce types within the
  data. Make sure the chart is clearly labeled and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors of the pie chart segments?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels on the segments?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  5. Should the percentage labels inside the segments have a specific format (e.g.,
  one decimal place)?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific segment of the pie chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the border style of the pie chart segments?

  8. Should the chart include annotations or additional information anywhere?
