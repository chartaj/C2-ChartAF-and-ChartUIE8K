initial_prompt: I have a dataset that includes various details about divorces in a
  specific region, such as divorce date, type, age, and occupation of partners as
  well as marriage details and residency. I would like a heatmap that shows the correlation
  between the ages of both partners and the monthly income in pesos. Additionally,
  include data on the duration of the marriage in years and the number of children,
  highlighting patterns or significant findings. Make it clear and visually appealing,
  so I can easily identify any correlations. This will help in understanding the socio-economic
  factors related to divorce.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for the axes and data points?

  3. Do you have a specific range for the ages or monthly income that you want to
  focus on?

  4. Should any specific categories (e.g., occupation or education level) be highlighted
  in the heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer displaying the correlation values as text within the heatmap cells?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or notes for patterns and significant
  findings?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any particular font styles or sizes that you would like to be used
  in the heatmap?'
