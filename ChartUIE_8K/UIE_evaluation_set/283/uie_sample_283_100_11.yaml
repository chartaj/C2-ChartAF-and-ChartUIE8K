initial_prompt: I am working on a project regarding divorce statistics in Mexico.
  I have a dataset with several details like "Type_of_divorce," "Age_partner_man,"
  "Age_partner_woman," "Monthly_income_partner_man_peso," and "Monthly_income_partner_woman_peso."
  I would like to visualize this data using a bar chart. Specifically, I'm interested
  in comparing the "Type_of_divorce" with the "Monthly_income_partner_man_peso" and
  "Monthly_income_partner_woman_peso." Could you create a bar chart that shows the
  average monthly income for both partners based on the type of divorce? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal bars?

  3. Do you want the bars representing the income of men and women to be grouped side-by-side
  or stacked?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the bars showing the average income
  values?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font style and size used in the chart?

  7. Would you like to display a legend to distinguish between the income of men and
  women?

  8. Are there any specific annotations you want to include in the chart to highlight
  key points?

  9. Do you prefer a specific title for the chart and the axes labels? If so, please
  provide the text.'
