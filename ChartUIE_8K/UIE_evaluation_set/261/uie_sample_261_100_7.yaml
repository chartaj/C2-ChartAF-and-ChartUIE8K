initial_prompt: I want to visualize a treemap using the NASA Astronauts data from
  1959 to the present. The treemap should categorize astronauts based on their 'Group'
  with further subdivisions for 'Status' (Active, Retired, Deceased). Each rectangle
  should represent an astronaut and be color-coded by 'Gender' (Male, Female). The
  size of the rectangles should correspond to the number of 'Space Flights' each astronaut
  has completed. Please ensure to include informative labels with the astronaut's
  name and the number of spacewalks. The aim is to get a visual understanding of the
  distribution and achievements of astronauts over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing the different
  genders?

  2. How would you like to handle astronauts with zero spacewalks in the labels?

  3. Should the labels be always visible, or only on hover/click?

  4. Do you have a specific size preference or range for the rectangles based on the
  number of space flights?

  5. Is there any specific arrangement or order you prefer for the categories within
  the treemap?

  6. Would you like to include any supplementary information or legends explaining
  the categories and color codes?

  7. How would you like to handle astronauts where some data might be missing or incomplete?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the fonts or styles of the labels?'
