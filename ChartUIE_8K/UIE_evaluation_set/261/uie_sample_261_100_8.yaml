initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot using the NASA Astronauts, 1959-Present
  dataset. The plot should visualize the relationship between astronauts' birth dates
  and the total number of space flights they have participated in. On the x-axis,
  I want the birth dates of the astronauts, and on the y-axis, I want the number of
  space flights. Please ensure to denote the points based on the astronaut's status
  (e.g., Active, Retired), using different colors. The scatter plot should help analyze
  trends or patterns between birth era and spaceflight frequency. Note missing values
  to prevent plotting errors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the astronauts''
  status?

  2. How would you like to handle missing values in the dataset? Should we exclude
  them or use a specific method for imputation?

  3. Do you want to add labels or tooltips to the data points for additional information
  when hovering over them?

  4. Would you prefer a logarithmic scale for the axes, especially if the data spans
  a wide range?

  5. Are there specific date formats you prefer for the x-axis (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD,
  MM/DD/YYYY)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the size and style of the markers on the scatter
  plot?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have any requirements for axis labels or legends in terms of font size
  or style?

  9. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the scatter plot?

  10. Should the scatter plot include a trend line to help visualize the correlation
  between birth dates and the number of space flights?'
