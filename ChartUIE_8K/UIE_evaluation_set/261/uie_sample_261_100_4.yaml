initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the status of NASA astronauts
  by year. Use the "Year" column for the x-axis and count the number of astronauts
  for each "Status" category (Active, Retired, etc.) on the y-axis. Color code the
  bars based on the "Status" to differentiate between categories. Include a legend
  to indicate which color corresponds to which status. This will help to show the
  distribution and changes in astronaut status over time. Make sure to handle any
  missing data appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent each "Status"
  category, or should the colors be automatically selected?

  2. Do you prefer the x-axis to display the years in a specific format (e.g., in
  intervals of 5 years)?

  3. Should the y-axis show exact counts for each status category or percentages?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, in which direction (vertical,
  horizontal, both)?

  5. Do you want any specific annotations or labels for data points on the bars?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the titles, labels, and
  legend?

  7. Are there any specific years or status categories you would like to highlight
  on the chart?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. Exact counts for each status category.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.
