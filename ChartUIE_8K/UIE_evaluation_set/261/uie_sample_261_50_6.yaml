initial_prompt: Create a histogram that shows the distribution of the number of space
  flights among NASA astronauts from 1959 to present. Use bins for the number of flights

questions: '1. What title would you like for the histogram?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars?

  astronauts?

  and y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preference for the range of the x-axis (number of flights)?

  7. Do you want to display a legend, or is that unnecessary for this histogram?

  8. Should the histogram include grid lines, and if so, for which axis (x, y, or
  both)?'
