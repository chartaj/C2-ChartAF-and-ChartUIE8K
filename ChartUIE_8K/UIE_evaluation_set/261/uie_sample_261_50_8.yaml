initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot of NASA astronauts showing their space flights
  versus space flight hours. Differentiate Active and Retired statuses with distinct

  \ 'Retired' statuses?\n2. Would you like the scatter plot to have grid lines for\
  \ easier reading?\n3. Do you want data points to be labeled with astronaut names\
  \ or any other specific identifiers?\n4. Should the plot include a legend to explain\
  \ the colors used for Active and Retired statuses?\n5. Do you want to display a\
  \ trend line to show the general pattern of correlation?\n6. Are there any specific\
  \ axis labels or titles you would like to include on the chart? \n7. Do you prefer\
  \ a specific scale for the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?\n8. Would you like\
  \ to highlight any particular data points or ranges in the scatter plot?"
