initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of Space Flights by NASA
  Astronauts from 1959 to present. Highlight active vs. retired astronauts to distinguish
  their statuses. Annotate bars with exact flight numbers for emphasis. This will
  help compare flight experience across different astronaut groups. Incorporate gender
  as a color-coded element in the bars for additional insights. Aim to provide clear
  comparisons and quick understanding of service duration and mission involvement.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for highlighting active
  vs. retired astronauts?

  2. How would you like the gender color-coding to be represented in the bars?

  3. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical bars for the bar chart?

  4. Should the bar chart include a legend to explain the color-coding for gender
  and status, or would you prefer direct annotations?

  5. How would you like the chart title and axis labels to be formatted?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for annotations on the
  bars?

  7. Is there a specific ordering for the bars that you would like to see (e.g., chronological
  order, number of space flights)?'
