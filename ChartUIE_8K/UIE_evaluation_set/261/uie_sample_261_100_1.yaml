initial_prompt: Visualize a box chart to display the distribution of space flight
  hours among astronauts from 1959-present. Use annotations to highlight those with
  the highest and lowest space flight hours. Emphasize the median values and use colors
  to differentiate outliers. This will help identify trends and outliers in astronautsâ€™
  flight hours, aiding research in space mission durations and astronaut careers.
  The chart should provide insights into how space flight careers vary. Add a descriptive
  title, axis labels, and a legend for clarity. The visualization aims to present
  a clear understanding of space flights over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette that you prefer for the chart?

  2. What style of annotations would you prefer for highlighting the highest and lowest
  space flight hours?

  3. Do you have any preference for the title format or wording?

  4. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., years at regular intervals)?

  5. Do you want any specific grid lines or background styling for better readability?

  6. Are there any specific font types or sizes you would like for titles, labels,
  or annotations?

  7. Would you like the outliers to be represented with specific shapes or symbols?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the legend (e.g., position,
  size)?

  9. Is there any specific timeframe segmentation you want (e.g., by decade)?

  10. Would you like additional information or data points to be included in tooltips
  when hovering over the chart elements?'
