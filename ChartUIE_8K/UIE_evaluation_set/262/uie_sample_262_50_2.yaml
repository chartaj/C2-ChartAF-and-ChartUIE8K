initial_prompt: Visualize the space mission data using a Geographic Heatmap highlighting
  'Location' and 'Year'. Annotate specific data points like unique 'Missions' and
  'RocketStatus'. Show heat intensity by the number of missions.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the geographic heatmap?

  2. How would you like unique missions to be annotated on the map?

  3. Do you prefer specific symbols or labels to represent ''RocketStatus'' on the
  map?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the heat intensity in terms of
  the number of missions?

  5. Do you have a preference for the heatmap''s geographic projection (e.g., Mercator,
  Albers)?

  6. Should we include a time slider or timeline to filter and view data across different
  years?

  7. Would you prefer tooltips to display additional information when hovering over
  specific data points?

  8. Is there any specific range of years that you are most interested in focusing
  on?

  9. How would you like the scale of the heat intensity (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  10. Would you like to include any background layers (e.g., satellite imagery, political
  boundaries) on the geographic heatmap?'
