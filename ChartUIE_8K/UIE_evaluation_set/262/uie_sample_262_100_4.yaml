initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the Real Time Space Mission Dataset. Visualize
  the number of missions conducted per company. The x-axis should represent the companies,
  and the y-axis should represent the count of missions. Highlight the top five companies
  with the most missions. Include different colors for each bar to distinguish between
  companies easily. Ensure the chart title is "Number of Missions Conducted by Each
  Company". Also, add labels for each bar to show the exact count of missions.

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you want for the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal bar chart?

  8. Would you like any gridlines on the chart, and if so, what style should they
  be?

  9. Should the x-axis labels be rotated for better readability, especially if there
  are many companies to display?

  10. Is there any specific way you want the data to be sorted (e.g., by the number
  of missions in descending order)?'
