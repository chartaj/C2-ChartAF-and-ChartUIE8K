initial_prompt: Visualize the Real Time Space Mission Dataset with a line chart showing
  "Year" on the x-axis and "MissionStatus" on the y-axis. Annotate highlights of key
  missions from the "Mission" data to emphasize mission activities over the years.
  The annotated points should include the "Company" and "Rocket" details, especially
  for any 'Retired' status rockets. Include data-driven text annotations for notable
  changes in "MissionStatus" and ensure the unique missions are highlighted for better
  clarity. Also, clarify missing values for "Price" and "Time" fields as context for
  gaps in the timeline.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the line chart?

  2. Would you like to distinguish different companies by colors or markers?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style of annotations (e.g., arrows, labels,
  tooltip)?

  4. Is there a specific format you would like for the data-driven text annotations?

  5. Should the annotated key missions be highlighted with different markers or shapes?

  6. How detailed do you want the annotations to be regarding ''Company'' and ''Rocket''
  details?

  7. Would you like to handle missing values in "Price" and "Time" with specific symbols
  or color coding?

  8. Do you prefer a particular type of line for the chart (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  9. Should the y-axis (MissionStatus) have any specific labeling conventions or thresholds?'
