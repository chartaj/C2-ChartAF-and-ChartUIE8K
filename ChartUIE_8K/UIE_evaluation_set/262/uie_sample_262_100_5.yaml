initial_prompt: I have space mission data with details like company, location, year,
  mission status, and price. I want to visualize this as a box plot to observe the
  distribution and outliers of mission prices over the years. The plot should display
  the variation between years and if possible, highlight the mission success and rocket
  status variations. This will help in understanding the financial trends and potential
  anomalies in space missions across different time periods. Please ensure the chart
  is clear and labeled appropriately to reflect the dataset variables mentioned.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different years or categories
  (e.g., mission success, rocket status)?

  2. How would you like to differentiate between ''MissionStatus'' categories (e.g.,
  different colors, shapes, or labels)?

  3. How would you prefer to highlight the outliers in the box plot?

  4. Do you have a preferred style for the box plot (e.g., traditional, minimalistic,
  with or without whiskers, etc.)?

  5. Would you like any particular annotations or markers on the chart to highlight
  key data points or years?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font or style for the labels on the chart?

  7. Is there any specific order you would like the years to be arranged in (e.g.,
  chronological)?

  8. Are there any additional filters or segments you want to apply to the data before
  visualizing it?'
