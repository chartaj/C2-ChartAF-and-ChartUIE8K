initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the UCI Heart Disease Data. It should
  compare the number of patients with different types of chest pain ('cp') across
  the four datasets ('dataset'). Each bar should represent one type of chest pain
  (e.g., typical angina, atypical angina, non-anginal pain, asymptomatic) and group
  the bars by the dataset (e.g., Cleveland, Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach). Missing
  values can be ignored. Also, differentiate the bars by color for easy comparison.
  Make sure the labels are clear and the chart is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars representing different
  types of chest pain?

  2. Would you like to include a legend explaining the colors used for each type of
  chest pain?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific style or font for the labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  6. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular order in which you would like the datasets (e.g., Cleveland,
  Hungarian, Switzerland, Long Beach) to appear?

  8. How would you like to handle data labels on the bars (e.g., inside the bar, outside
  the bar, or not at all)?

  9. Do you need any specific annotations or notes displayed on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a legend.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Title: "Distribution of Chest Pain Types Across Datasets"

  6. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  7. No specific order.

  8. Inside the bar would be good.

  9. No specific annotations or notes needed.'
