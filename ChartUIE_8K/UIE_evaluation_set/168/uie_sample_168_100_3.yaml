initial_prompt: Create a box chart for the UCI Heart Disease Data, focusing on the
  distribution of 'age', 'trestbps', 'chol', 'thalch', and 'oldpeak' columns. Each
  column should be represented as a separate box in the chart. Ensure that outliers
  are highlighted to show variability in the dataset. Label the y-axis as "Values"
  and the x-axis with the respective column names. This will help in visualizing the
  spread and central tendency of these health indicators across the dataset, with
  special attention to the differences between patients.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific gridlines or axes styles to be highlighted?

  3. Are there any annotations or titles needed besides "Values" for the y-axis and
  column names for the x-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation or arrangement for the box plots?

  5. Should the chart include a legend or additional labeling for better clarity?

  6. Are there any additional details or tooltips you want to be displayed when interacting
  with the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any statistical markers such as mean or median values
  on the box plots?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart background color or style?

  9. Should the outliers be marked in a specific way, such as with different colors,
  shapes, or sizes?

  10. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles
  on the chart?'
