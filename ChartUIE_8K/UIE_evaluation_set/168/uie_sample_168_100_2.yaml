initial_prompt: Please visualize the UCI Heart Disease dataset with a histogram showing
  the distribution of 'age' across all samples. Highlight key age groups with different
  colors to easily identify risk groups. Add text annotations to showcase critical
  values like mean and median ages. Also, highlight elements where any heart disease
  condition ('num' > 0) appears. The histogram should help in understanding the age
  distribution and its correlation with heart disease prevalence. This visualization
  aims to provide insights into which age groups are most affected by heart disease,
  aiding in targeted healthcare strategies.
questions: '1. What color palette would you prefer for highlighting different age
  groups and risk groups?

  2. Do you have a specific range for age groups that you would like to see highlighted,
  or should default intervals be used?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations for mean and median ages to be placed
  within the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style and format of the text annotations (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the elements with heart disease conditions
  (''num'' > 0) to be highlighted (e.g., a distinct color or marker)?

  6. How many bins would you like in the histogram, or would you prefer an automatically
  determined optimal number of bins?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Default intervals can be used.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. A distinct color would be good.

  6. I would prefer an automatically determined optimal number of bins.'
