initial_prompt: Let's create a stacked column chart to visualize the UCI Heart Disease
  Data. The chart should break down the 'cp' (chest pain type) across different 'sex'
  categories. Use annotations to highlight the total counts for each chest pain type
  and any significant differences between sexes. The purpose is to easily compare
  the prevalence of chest pain types between males and females, providing insights
  into heart disease symptoms distribution. Highlight segments where the data is particularly
  skewed, such as where one sex has a significantly higher occurrence of a specific
  chest pain type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different chest pain types?

  2. Would you like specific labels for each section of the stacked columns?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for annotations?

  4. How detailed should the annotations be (e.g., percentage, count, or both)?

  5. Are there any specific segments or chest pain types you want to prioritize in
  highlighting?

  6. Would you prefer gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you want to include a legend explaining the colors used for different chest
  pain types?

  8. Would you like to include axis titles and, if so, what should they be?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and subtitles?

  10. Do you want to use any particular formatting for highlighting significant differences?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Percentage would be good.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, gridlines would help with readability.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. Yes, axis titles would be good. The x-axis should be "Sex" and the y-axis should
  be "Count of Chest Pain Types."

  9. I do not have specific preferences for the chart title and subtitles.

  10. I do not know.'
