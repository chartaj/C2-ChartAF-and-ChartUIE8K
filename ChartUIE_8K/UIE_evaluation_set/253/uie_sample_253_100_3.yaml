initial_prompt: I need an area chart illustrating the trends of cryptocurrency prices
  from 2018 to 2023. The chart should plot daily 'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' and 'Close'
  values for each of the cryptocurrencies. Make sure to highlight the volume of trades
  using a secondary axis to show its variation over time. Include details on missing
  values and how they might affect the data representation. Use different colors to
  differentiate between the cryptocurrencies. Add legends and labels for better understanding.
  The aim is to visualize how these cryptos have performed and fluctuated over the
  years.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for differentiating between
  the cryptocurrencies?

  2. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legends?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be represented or annotated on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer any specific layout or positioning for the legends?

  5. Should the secondary axis for volume be on the left or right side of the chart?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or markers to highlight significant
  events or trends in the chart?

  7. Are there specific title or subtitles you would like for the chart?

  8. Are gridlines or background shading preferred to enhance the readability of the
  chart?

  9. Do you want to include a tooltip or any hover information for cryptocurrency
  values and volumes?'
