initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualizing the volume of transactions for different
  cryptocurrencies over the period from 2018 to 2023. Each cell in the heatmap should
  represent the transaction volume on a specific date for a specific cryptocurrency.
  The x-axis should be the dates and the y-axis should be the different types of cryptocurrencies.
  The color intensity should represent the volume of transactions, with darker colors
  indicating higher volumes. This will help identify trends and patterns in transaction
  volumes over time. Please use the given data formats to generate the heatmap.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. What granularity do you prefer for the dates on the x-axis (daily, weekly, monthly)?

  3. Should weekends and holidays be highlighted or distinguished in any way?

  4. Do you need axis labels or any specific formatting for the dates and cryptocurrency
  types?

  5. Do you require a legend to explain the color intensity representing transaction
  volumes?

  6. Would you like any specific annotations or markers for significant dates or events?

  7. Are there specific cryptocurrencies you are particularly interested in highlighting
  on the heatmap?'

  2. I am not sure about the granularity; maybe monthly?
