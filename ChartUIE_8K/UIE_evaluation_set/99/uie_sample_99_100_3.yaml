initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map that visualizes the geographic distribution
  of the top 1000 YouTubers based on their countries. Use the 'Country' and 'Suscribers'
  columns to show the total number of subscribers per country. Please make sure to
  use a color gradient to indicate the varying subscriber counts, with higher counts
  represented by darker colors. Provide interactive tooltips that display the exact
  subscriber numbers when hovering over each country. The map should be easy to read
  with clear legends and labels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the gradient that represents
  subscriber counts?

  2. Is there a specific style or format you prefer for the map''s legend and labels?

  3. Should certain countries or regions be highlighted or emphasized in any way?

  4. Do you prefer any particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Are there any specific thresholds or ranges you would like to be defined for
  the color gradients?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the geographical boundaries, such as including
  or excluding certain territories or regions?

  7. Is there any specific font style or size you would like for the text in the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, but a blue gradient might be nice.

  2. I do not know, as long as they are clear and easy to read.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, maybe Mercator?

  5. I do not know.
