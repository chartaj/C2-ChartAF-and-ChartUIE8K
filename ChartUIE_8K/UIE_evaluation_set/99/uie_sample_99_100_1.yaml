initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart displaying the top 1000 YouTubers, focusing
  on their subscribers and likes. Use colors to distinguish between subscribers and
  likes. Highlight usernames with the highest numbers in both categories. Annotate
  the top 3 YouTubers prominently with their names and subscriber counts. Ensure the
  x-axis lists YouTubers and the y-axis shows numerical values. Highlight the "Country"
  to spotlight geographical trends. Provide general insights via non-data-driven annotations
  for education on interpreting the chart. Maintain the arts-and-entertainment context
  to keep the visualization relevant.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for representing ''subscribers''
  and ''likes'' in the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you like the top 3 YouTubers to be annotated and highlighted (e.g.,
  color change, bold text)?

  3. Are there specific countries or geographical regions you want to highlight more
  prominently?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for user annotations and labels?

  5. Would you like to include any specific legends or explanatory text on the chart
  for better interpretation?

  6. Do you need any additional gridlines or markers on the y-axis for improved readability?

  7. Is there a specific order you want the YouTubers to be displayed on the x-axis
  (e.g., by rank, alphabetical order)?

  8. How would you like the ''Country'' information to be highlighted or categorized
  in the chart (e.g., using different shades, borders)?'
