initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing social media engagement across
  different posts. Use the "num_reactions" for the x-axis and "num_comments" for the
  y-axis. Highlight data points based on "status_type" with different colors. Include
  text annotations to display values for notable data points with high engagement
  (either reactions or comments). This chart is intended to help analyze engagement
  patterns and identify which types of posts generate more interaction within the
  online community. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for highlighting the data points
  based on "status_type"?

  2. What specific threshold should be used to determine the notable data points with
  high engagement for text annotations?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines in the scatter plot?

  4. Should the axes have specific ranges or scales (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size or style of the text annotations?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used for different "status_type"?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for axis labels and chart titles?

  8. Should we include additional contextual information or trend lines in the scatter
  plot?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the notable data points to be marked on
  the chart (e.g., different marker shapes or sizes)?'
