initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize social media engagement metrics
  like num_reactions, num_comments, num_shares, etc., for different types of status
  (link, photo, status, video). Highlight the significant engagement types using different
  colors or sizes to make them stand out. Use text annotations to specify values for
  critical data points and trends. Ensure the visualization focuses on comparing engagement
  across different status types to help analyze which types drive the most interaction.
  This analysis is crucial for understanding how different content types perform within
  online communities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant engagement
  types?

  2. Are there specific colors you want to use for each engagement type?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations be placed inside the bars or outside?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the colors or sizes used for different
  engagement types?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific order in which the different types of status should be presented?

  8. Are there any particular engagement metrics (e.g., ''num_reactions'') that you
  want to be more emphasized?

  9. Do you have preferences for the overall chart layout or aspect ratio (e.g., wider
  versus taller)?

  10. Would you like to add any additional labels or titles to the chart to provide
  more context?'
