initial_prompt: 'I''d like a bar chart that visualizes the engagement metrics from
  ''291.csv''. The x-axis should represent different engagement types like reactions,
  comments, shares, likes, loves, etc., while the y-axis should show their respective
  counts. Highlight unique values in varying colors. Separately, include another set
  of bars that represents the different status types (link, photo, status, video)
  with their counts. This chart should provide a clear comparative view of how each
  engagement metric and status type performs. Title it: "Social Media Engagement:
  A Comprehensive Analysis".'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for highlighting
  unique values?

  2. Should each set of bars (engagement metrics and status types) be in different
  colors or shades?

  3. Do you want the bars to be grouped or stacked for better comparison?

  4. What order would you like the engagement types and status types to be displayed
  on the x-axis (alphabetical, count descending, etc.)?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show exact counts?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type or size for the chart
  title and axis labels?

  7. Do you prefer any specific background color or gridline style for the chart?

  engagement types and status types?
