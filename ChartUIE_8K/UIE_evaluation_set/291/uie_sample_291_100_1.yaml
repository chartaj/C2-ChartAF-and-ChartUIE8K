initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of engagement
  metrics like reactions, comments, shares, likes, etc., from the provided social
  media data. Annotate key data points to highlight interesting trends, such as unusually
  high or low engagement for specific post types (link, photo, status, video). Use
  color to differentiate metrics and draw attention to significant variations. Highlight
  the purpose of the chart to provide a clear overview of social media engagement,
  focusing on elements like reactions and comments, and use annotations to emphasize
  noteworthy data points. The chart should be easy to interpret for general audience.
