initial_prompt: 'Please create an area chart to visualize the global Google search
  trends over time. The x-axis should represent the months (Monat), and the y-axis
  should show the number of searches. Have two separate areas stacked on top of each
  other: one for "wizard (Weltweit)" and another for "witch (Weltweit)." Use different
  colors to differentiate between wizards and witches. The chart should clearly show
  the trends from 2004-01 to 2004-03 and should allow for easy comparison of how the
  search volumes evolve over time. Thank you!'
