initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of park scores
  across San Francisco. Use the Score column from the provided data. I want to see
  how these scores are spread out over different parks. It would be great if you could
  also include labels for the x-axis (score ranges) and y-axis (frequency of parks).
  Additionally, if possible, highlight specific ranges (like 0.7-0.8, 0.8-0.9, etc.)
  to easily identify where most parks fall. This will help in understanding the overall
  quality and distribution of the parks evaluated.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Are there specific score ranges you want to highlight besides 0.7-0.8 and 0.8-0.9?

  3. Would you like the histogram to include a title? If so, what should it be?

  4. Do you prefer specific bin sizes for the histogram, or should the bins be auto-determined?

  5. Do you want the score ranges on the x-axis to be evenly distributed or tailored
  based on the data distribution?

  6. Would you like any annotations or additional text on the chart to highlight key
  findings?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the title could be "Distribution of Park Scores in San Francisco".

  4. Specific bin sizes are not necessary, auto-determined bins are fine.

  5. Evenly distributed score ranges on the x-axis would be good.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
