initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize San Francisco Park Scores.
  The map should highlight parks with various facility types by their scores. Use
  color gradients to represent different score levels, focusing on parks with extreme
  scores for emphasis. Incorporate text annotations to display park names and scores
  for selected parks. Highlight parks with the highest and lowest scores to draw attention.
  Include the ability to filter by facility type and state. Ensure the map includes
  context such as zip codes, perimeter lengths, and acres for better understanding.
  The goal is to present real-estate data effectively for analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap gradients to represent
  different score levels?

  2. Do you have a preferred font or style for the text annotations displaying park
  names and scores?

  3. Would you like to specify any particular parks that should always be annotated,
  regardless of their scores?

  4. Is there a specific range of scores you are most interested in, aside from the
  highest and lowest?

  5. How would you like the park names and scores to be highlighted for parks with
  the highest and lowest scores (e.g., bold, larger font, different color)?

  6. Are there any specific zip codes or regions within San Francisco that you want
  to emphasize or be clearly marked on the map?

  7. Would you prefer any particular map style or background (e.g., satellite view,
  street map)?

  8. Do you have a preference for how the filter options for facility type and state
  should be presented on the map (e.g., dropdown menu, checkboxes)?

  9. Do you want additional contextual information, such as perimeter lengths and
  acres, displayed in a tooltip or as part of the park annotations?'
