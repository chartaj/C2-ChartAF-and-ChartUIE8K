initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the "San Francisco Park Scores"
  dataset. The chart should display the trends in park scores over time (FQ) across
  different parks (Park). Use text annotations to highlight specific data points with
  notably high or low scores. Also, add highlights to emphasize certain parks that
  show significant trends or anomalies in their scores. This visualization will help
  us analyze park performance trends and identify areas needing improvement. Make
  sure to include axis labels for clarity. Use different colors for different parks
  for better differentiation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the parks?

  2. How would you like the highlights for significant trends or anomalies to be displayed?

  3. What style of text annotations do you prefer for noting specific data points
  with high or low scores?

  4. Do you have any specific font requirements for the axis labels and annotations?

  5. Should the time intervals (FQ) on the x-axis be displayed in a specific format?

  6. Would you prefer solid lines, dashed lines, or another style for the lines representing
  each park?

  7. Do you have any specific size requirements for the chart (dimensions)?

  8. Should the chart include a title or subtitle? If so, what should it be?

  9. Is there a preferred position for the legend on the chart?

  10. Are there any specific parks that you want to prioritize or emphasize in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure; maybe use brighter or bolder colors to emphasize?

  3. I do not know, perhaps simple and clear annotations?

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Solid lines would be fine.

  7. I do not have any specific preference for size.

  8. Yes, a title would be great. Something like "San Francisco Park Scores Over Time."

  9. I do not have a specific preference.

  10. I am not sure which ones, but any parks showing significant trends or anomalies
