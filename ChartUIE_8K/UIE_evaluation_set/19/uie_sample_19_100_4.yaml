initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for the Amazon Top 50 Bestselling Books from
  2009 to 2019. On one axis, plot the user ratings, and on the other axis, plot the
  number of reviews. Use different colors to differentiate between Fiction and Non-Fiction
  genres. The points should represent different books, with their price as the size
  of the scatter points. This will help visualize the correlation between user ratings
  and reviews and identify any notable trends in book genres over the years. Please
  ensure all relevant data is included for accuracy.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between Fiction
  and Non-Fiction genres?

  2. Would you like the axis labels and title to follow a specific format or style?

  3. Do you have any preference for the size scaling of the scatter points based on
  the book prices?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or data labels on the scatter
  points, such as book names or authors?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the chart labels
  and legends?

  6. Do you want any specific grid lines or background color for the scatter plot?

  7. Should the chart include a legend explaining the colors and sizes used for different
  genres and price ranges?

  8. Are there any specific aspects of the chart''s design that should align with
  your organization''s branding guidelines?'
