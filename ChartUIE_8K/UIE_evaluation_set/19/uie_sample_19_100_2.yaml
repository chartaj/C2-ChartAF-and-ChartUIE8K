initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the user ratings of bestselling books
  over different years. The x-axis should represent the years from 2009 to 2019, and
  the y-axis should show the user ratings. Highlight specific data points where the
  user rating is exceptionally high or low to draw attention. Add text annotations
  to these highlighted points to display the actual user rating and the book name.
  This visualization aims to show trends and fluctuations in book ratings over the
  years, helping identify patterns in user preferences. The chart should emphasize
  significant variations.
