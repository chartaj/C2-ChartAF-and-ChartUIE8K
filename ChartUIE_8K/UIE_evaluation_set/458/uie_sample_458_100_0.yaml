initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Ampltiude(a.u.)'
  from the provided dataset. Annotate specific data points to highlight significant
  amplitudes. Use different colors or sizes to emphasize these values and draw attention
  to their distribution patterns over time. This is to better understand amplitude
  variations and their possible causes. Include non-data-driven annotations to provide
  context or editorial comments where necessary. This visualization is intended for
  physics research, specifically focusing on amplitude behavior over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram and highlighted
  amplitude values?

  2. Should the annotated specific data points be labeled with exact values or just
  highlighted?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the bin size or range of values for the histogram?

  4. Are there specific significant amplitude thresholds you would like to use for
  highlighting?

  5. Would you like the time axis to be displayed linearly or logarithmically?

  6. Do you prefer the annotations to be placed within the chart area or in a separate
  legends/notes section?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  8. Do you wish to include grid lines or background shading for better readability
  of the data distribution?

  9. Should the chart title and axis labels include specific terminologies or units
  related to your research field?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Just highlighted.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Within the chart area.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, include grid lines.

  9. Yes, include specific terminologies or units related to physics research.'
