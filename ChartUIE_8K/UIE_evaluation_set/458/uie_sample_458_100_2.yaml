initial_prompt: Create a box chart using the time and amplitude data from the CSV
  file. Emphasize the unique values, especially around the mean levels. Highlight
  differences in amplitude across different time segments. Annotate key data points
  to focus the viewerâ€™s attention, using both data-driven and non-data-driven annotations
  for context. This visualization aims to provide insights into the distribution and
  variability of amplitude over time, likely relevant for a physics experiment. Use
  highlights to distinguish important data points that might otherwise be overlooked.
  Add some descriptive text for better orientation and understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting important
  data points?

  2. Would you prefer a particular color scheme for the chart?

  3. Do you have a preference for the format or font style of annotations?

  4. How detailed should the descriptive text be? Do you want brief explanations or
  more comprehensive descriptions?

  5. What specific thresholds or criteria should be used to define "unique values"
  around the mean levels?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading for better visualization
  of differences in amplitude?

  7. Are there any specific intervals or time segments you would like to focus on?

  8. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the box chart?'
answers: '

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer brief explanations.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines for better visualization.

  7. Yes, please focus on the time segments at the beginning, middle, and end of the
  data.

  8. I prefer a vertical orientation for the box chart.'
