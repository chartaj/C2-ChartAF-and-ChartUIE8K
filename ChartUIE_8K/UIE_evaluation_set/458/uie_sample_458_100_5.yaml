initial_prompt: 'Please create a radar chart to visualize the data from "../Extra_datas/data/458.csv".
  The chart should include all six columns: ''Time(sec)'', ''Amplitude(a.u.)'', and
  the four unnamed columns. This chart needs to represent each column as a separate
  axis on the radar. Include sample data points for a clear comparison between them.
  The context of this data is unknown but seems related to some scientific, possibly
  physics, measurements. Make sure the chart is straightforward to interpret with
  clear labels and a legend if required. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the different
  axes?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  3. Are there any specific labels or titles for the unnamed columns that you would
  like to include in the chart?

  4. Would you prefer to include data point markers for each sample data point, or
  should the lines be continuous without markers?

  5. Do you have a preference for the position or style of the legend?

  6. Should the axes be equally scaled, or would you prefer customized scales for
  each axis based on the data ranges of each attribute?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have any specific colors in mind.

  2. I am not sure, but perhaps gridlines could be helpful for comparison.

  3. I do not know, the current column names are fine.

  4. I think data point markers would be useful for better visualization.

  5. I do not have a preference for the legend position or style.

  6. I am not sure, but maybe equally scaled axes might be better for comparison.
