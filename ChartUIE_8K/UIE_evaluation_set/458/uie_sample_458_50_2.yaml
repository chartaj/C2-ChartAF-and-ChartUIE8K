initial_prompt: Create a box plot visualizing 'Ampltiude(a.u.)' over 'Time(sec)' from
  the provided dataset. Annotate specific data points to highlight anomalies or outliers,
  and use color to emphasize deviation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for emphasizing deviations?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations for the outliers?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the annotations?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for easier analysis?

  5. Do you prefer a particular order for displaying the ''Time(sec)'' on the x-axis
  (e.g., ascending, custom intervals)?

  6. Should there be any specific formatting for the axes labels or titles?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding used for highlighting
  deviations?

  9. Should the chart include summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) in the visual?

  10. Are there any specific data points or time segments you want to highlight separately?'
