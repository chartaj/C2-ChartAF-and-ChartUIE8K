initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot using the data from the file ''458.csv''.
  Plot ''Time(sec)'' on the x-axis and ''Ampltiude(a.u.)'' on the y-axis. Include
  the additional data columns ''Unnamed: 2'', ''Unnamed: 3'', ''Unnamed: 4'', and
  ''Unnamed: 5'' as separate scatter series on the same plot for comparison. Ensure
  each series has a different color and add a legend for clarity. The title of the
  chart should be "Scatter Plot of Amplitude vs. Time". Include axis labels and grid
  lines for better readability. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each data series?

  2. What style of markers would you prefer for the scatter plot (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font type or size for the title, axis labels, and legend?

  4. Would you like the grid lines to be solid, dashed, or dotted?

  5. Should there be any specific range or limits for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Do you want the legend to be placed in a specific location (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for each data series.

  2. I am not sure about the style of markers; you can choose what looks best.

  3. No specific preferences for font type or size.

  4. I do not know; whatever is standard or looks good.

  5. I have no specific range or limits for the x-axis and y-axis.

  6. I would like the legend to be placed at the top right.

  7. I do not have any additional annotations or notes to include on the chart.'
