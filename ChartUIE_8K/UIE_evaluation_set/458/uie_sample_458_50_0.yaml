initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing 'Time(sec)' against 'Ampltiude(a.u.)'
  to analyze amplitude distribution over time. Annotate specific high amplitude points
  to highlight their values and emphasize their significance. Highlight bins with
  unusually high values to draw viewers' attention. This helps in understanding data
  trends in a physics context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the chart?

  2. How many bins would you like to use for the histogram?

  3. Do you prefer any specific type of annotation for high amplitude points (e.g.,
  text labels, arrows)?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels be customized or have specific formatting?

  5. Would you like a grid or background pattern on the chart?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences for titles and labels?

  7. Would you like to add any titles or subtitles to the chart?

  8. Are there specific axis ranges you would like to set for the histogram?

  9. Do you prefer any specific way of highlighting bins with unusually high values
  (e.g., color, border thickness)?

  10. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Text labels for high amplitude points would be good.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I would like a title that says "Amplitude Distribution Over Time."

  8. I do not know.

  9. Highlight using a different color would be great.

  10. I am not sure.'
