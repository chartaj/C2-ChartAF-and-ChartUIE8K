initial_prompt: 'I''d like to create a bubble chart using the given dataset. The chart
  should have ''Time(sec)'' on the x-axis and ''Amplitude(a.u.)'' on the y-axis. Use
  the values from ''Unnamed: 2'', ''Unnamed: 3'', ''Unnamed: 4'', and ''Unnamed: 5''
  to determine the size of the bubbles. Each data point should be a bubble where the
  size reflects an average or combined value of these unnamed columns. Make sure the
  chart is clear and easy to read, as it is to visualize scientific data, presumably
  for a physics experiment. Please include legend and axis titles.'
questions: '1. What color palette would you prefer for the bubbles to ensure clarity
  and differentiation?

  2. Do you have specific preferences for the size range of the bubbles?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, in what style (dotted, solid)?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the bubbles?

  5. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis titles
  and legend?

  6. Should the bubbles be transparent or solid?

  7. Do you prefer a title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?

  8. Would you like trend lines or statistical indicators included in the chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  10. Should any specific data points be highlighted? If yes, which ones and how?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have specific preferences for the size range of the bubbles.

  3. Grid lines would be helpful, I do not know which style.

  4. No, I do not want any specific annotations or labels on the bubbles.

  5. I am not sure about font styles or sizes.

  6. I have no specific preference regarding bubble transparency.

  7. Yes, the title should be "Bubble Chart of Time vs. Amplitude".

  8. I am not sure about trend lines or statistical indicators.

  9. I do not have a preference for the positioning of the legend.

  10. No, there are no specific data points that need to be highlighted.'
