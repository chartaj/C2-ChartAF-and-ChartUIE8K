initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the relationship between 'Time(sec)'
  and 'Amplitude(a.u.)'. Ensure you also plot the other unnamed columns (2 to 5) against
  'Time(sec)'. Highlight key data points by changing their color or size and add text
  annotations to display their specific values. This will help us focus on significant
  trends or anomalies in the data. The visualization should be clear, concise, and
  ideal for understanding the physical behaviors over time. The data does not have
  any missing values, so please use the entire dataset for the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  different columns?

  2. Would you like to set specific thresholds for highlighting key data points?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed (e.g., font size, positioning)?

  4. Are there any particular ranges of data that you want to emphasize more than
  others?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for the line (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability, and if so, vertical,
  horizontal, or both?

  7. Is there any specific legend placement you prefer?

  8. Do you want any specific titles or labels for the axes and chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have specific thresholds in mind, but significant peaks or dips would
  be good.

  3. I would prefer the text annotations to be clearly readable with a medium font
  size and positioned close to the highlighted data points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I would prefer solid lines for clarity.

  6. Both vertical and horizontal grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I have no specific preference for the legend placement.

  8. A clear title for the chart and labels for the axes would be great.'
