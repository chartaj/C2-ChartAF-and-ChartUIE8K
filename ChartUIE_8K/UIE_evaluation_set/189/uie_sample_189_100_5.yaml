initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot to visualize the Stand abilities from Jojo's
  Bizarre Adventure. The columns that should be used are PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC,
  and DEV. Each column will be a separate axis on the plot, and each dot will represent
  a unique Stand. The position of each dot on the axis will correspond to the values
  (A, B, C, D, E) of the abilities. This chart should help illustrate the distribution
  and correlation of Stands' abilities effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the dots representing each
  Stand?

  2. Would you like the axis labels to use the full names of the abilities or their
  abbreviations (e.g., ''Power'' vs. ''PWR'')?

  3. Should there be a legend that explains the values (A, B, C, D, E) of the abilities?

  4. Do you prefer any specific shapes for the dots, or should they all be the same?

  5. Would you like grid lines added to the axes for better readability?

  6. Should the dots be labeled with the names of the Stands they represent, or should
  it be a clean plot without labels?

  7. Do you want any specific titles or subtitles on the plot?

  8. Should the axis values (A, B, C, D, E) be color-coded or use different marker
  symbols to represent different abilities?'
