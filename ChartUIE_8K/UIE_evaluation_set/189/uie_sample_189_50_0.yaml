initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the distribution of Stand attributes
  (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure data. Annotate significant
  values and highlight most common unique values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Do you want each attribute (e.g., PWR, SPD) to be displayed in separate subplots
  or combined in a single plot?

  3. Are there particular significant values you want to be annotated or should it
  be based on certain criteria (like top 10%)?

  4. How would you like the most common unique values to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, bold outline)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish the different Stand attributes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Should the bars be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending, descending, alphabetical)?

  8. Do you want any gridlines or specific styling for the background of the chart?

  9. Is there any specific font or size you want for the annotations and labels?'
