initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the data from Jojo's Bizarre
  Adventure. Plot the 'Stand' on the x-axis to display each unique stand, and on the
  y-axis, we should visualize the 'PWR' ratings. Use different colors or markers to
  distinguish between 'SPD' ratings as another variable to make it more insightful.
  Add labels for each point to indicate 'PRC' values. Ensure the chart is clear and
  includes legends because there are multiple columns with variable types and some
  missing values. This will help in analyzing each stand's overall performance visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  ''SPD'' ratings?

  2. What marker styles would you like to use for different ''SPD'' ratings, if you
  have any preference?

  3. How would you like the labels for ''PRC'' values to be displayed (e.g., font
  size, font color)?

  4. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want to include for the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific chart size or aspect ratio?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legends?

  8. Do you have any preference on how to handle the missing values in the dataset?'
