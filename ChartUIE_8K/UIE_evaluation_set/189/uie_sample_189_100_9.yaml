initial_prompt: Creating a parallel coordinates chart to visualize Stand abilities
  from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is helpful. Plot the attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER,
  PRC, DEV) on parallel axes. Each line represents a Stand, showing its performance
  across these attributes. Focus on differentiating strong and weak Stands using distinctive
  colors for clarity. Highlight missing values in the dataset. Generate a chart that
  makes it easy to compare Stand abilities side-by-side, providing insights into similarities
  and differences. This visualization will aid in understanding diverse Stand capabilities
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing strong
  and weak Stands?

  2. How would you like missing values to be highlighted (e.g., a distinct color,
  pattern, or marker)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV)
  on the parallel axes?

  4. Would you like the chart to include axis labels and a legend? If so, any preferences
  for their design?

  5. Are there any specific Stands that you would like to emphasize or distinguish
  further in the chart?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I would prefer missing values to be highlighted with a distinct color.

  3. I am not sure about the order of the attributes.

  4. Yes, please include axis labels and a legend. I do not have any specific design
  preferences.

  5. I do not know of any specific Stands to emphasize.
