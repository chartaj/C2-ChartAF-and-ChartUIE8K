initial_prompt: 'I need a radar chart visualizing the stats of the different stands
  from Jojo''s Bizarre Adventure. The chart should include the categories: PWR (Power),
  SPD (Speed), RNG (Range), PER (Persistence), PRC (Precision), and DEV (Development).
  Each stand (e.g., Anubis, Atum, Bastet) should be represented as a separate line
  on the radar chart. Make sure to handle any missing data appropriately. The comparative
  visualization will help illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each stand in
  relation to one another. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the radar chart?

  2. How would you like the missing data to be handled (e.g., interpolation, leaving
  blank)?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be displayed in the radar chart?

  4. Would you like to include a legend on the chart indicating which line corresponds
  to which stand?

  5. Should the axes be normalized or scaled in any particular way?

  6. Do you have a preference for the style of lines (e.g., solid, dashed) used for
  different stands?

  7. Do you want labels on the axes to indicate the different categories?

  8. Would you like to add data point markers on the lines for each category value?

  9. Is there any specific font or font size you would like for the chart labels and
  titles?

  10. Do you want to include a title or subtitle on the radar chart? If yes, please
  specify the text.'
