initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating the changes in album rankings from
  2003, 2012, and 2020 for the Rolling Stone Album Rankings dataset. Focus specifically
  on highlighting significant changes in rankings for selected artists like Frank
  Sinatra, Bo Diddley, and Elvis Presley. Use text annotations to display the ranking
  values at these points to draw attention to the ranking shifts. Additionally, use
  different line colors to distinguish between artists and incorporate the peak billboard
  position to provide context. This will help in visualizing the trajectory and impact
  of these albums over time.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for each artist''s line on the chart?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations on the ranking
  values?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or appearance of the lines (e.g., solid,
  dashed)?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or order for displaying the artists in the chart?

  6. Should the chart display gridlines, and if so, do you have a preference for their
  appearance?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or markers aside from ranking values
  to provide context (e.g., significant events or album releases)?

  8. Is there a preferred title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels or their styles?

  10. Would you like to incorporate any specific background or theme for the chart?

  11. Should the chart include any interactive elements, such as tooltips, or will
  it be purely static?'
