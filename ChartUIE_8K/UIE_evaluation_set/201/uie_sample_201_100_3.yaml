initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the World Happiness Report
  2023 data. Use 'Ladder score' and related metrics such as 'Standard error of ladder
  score', 'upperwhisker', and 'lowerwhisker' to show variations. Include countries
  like Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Highlight key factors like 'Logged GDP per capita',
  'Social support', 'Healthy life expectancy', 'Freedom to make life choices', 'Generosity',
  and 'Perceptions of corruption' as individual segments within each box. This will
  help in comparing happiness scores and contributing factors across these countries.
