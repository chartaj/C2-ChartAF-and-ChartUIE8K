initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the World Happiness Report 2023 data. Emphasize
  the 'Ladder score' across different countries. Use annotations to highlight top
  scoring countries like Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. The heatmap should visualize
  how 'Logged GDP per capita', 'Social support', and 'Healthy life expectancy' contribute
  to these scores, with specific annotations on key influencers (e.g., GDP, social
  support). This visualization should assist in understanding the psychological factors
  contributing to perceived happiness globally. Highlight outliers and patterns, making
  it clear which factors are most impactful on overall happiness.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. How detailed should the annotations be for top-scoring countries?

  3. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color scale?

  4. Do you prefer the country names to be displayed on the x-axis or y-axis?

  5. Would you like to include a title and subtitles for the heatmap?

  6. Should the annotations for key influencers (e.g., GDP, social support) be located
  inside or outside the heatmap cells?

  7. How would you like outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different colors, symbols)?

  8. Do you have specific font preferences or sizes for the labels and annotations?'

  2. Detailed enough to highlight why they are top-scoring.

  3. Yes.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes.

  6. Inside the heatmap cells.
