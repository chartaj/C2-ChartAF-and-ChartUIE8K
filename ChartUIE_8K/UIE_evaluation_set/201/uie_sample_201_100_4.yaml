initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the ladder scores from the World
  Happiness Report 2023. The x-axis should represent the country names, and the y-axis
  should show the ladder scores. Make sure to include Finland, Denmark, and Iceland
  in the chart. Additionally, I'd like error bars to represent the standard error
  of the ladder scores for each country to understand the variability. Highlight the
  "Healthy life expectancy" and "Social support" as additional bars for each country,
  so it showcases these important factors influencing happiness. Use different colors
  for each data series for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the different data
  series?

  3. What font style and size do you prefer for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  8. How much spacing would you prefer between the bars?

  positioned?
