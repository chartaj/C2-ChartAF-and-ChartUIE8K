initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that visualizes the frequency of each unique 'label'
  in the SAP press releases dataset. The x-axis should have the different labels (e.g.,
  Story, Partnership, Award, etc.), and the y-axis should show the count of each label.
  Since the dataset pertains to SAP's business activities, the chart will help us
  understand the distribution of various types of press releases they publish. Ensure
  the bars are labeled clearly and the chart is easy to interpret at a glance. This
  will assist us in identifying key areas of SAP's communication strategy.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Should there be any specific ordering of the labels on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  frequency)?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, in which axis
  or both?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the bar labels and axis
  titles?

  6. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  7. Should there be any annotations or data labels directly on the bars to display
  the counts?

  8. Do you prefer any particular style for the bar edges (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend if the color scheme varies among different
  labels?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions (width and height) you would like the chart
  to adhere to?'
