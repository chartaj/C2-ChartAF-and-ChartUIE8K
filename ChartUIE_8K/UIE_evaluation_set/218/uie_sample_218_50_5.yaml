initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the frequency of different labels
  in the press release headlines from SAP's business dataset. This will help visualize
  how often each type of event is reported.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?

  2. Should the labels on the x-axis be displayed in a specific order, such as alphabetical
  or by frequency?

  3. Do you prefer the y-axis to display the frequency counts as integers, percentages,
  or both?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on top of each bar to show the exact frequency
  values?

  5. Do you need a title for the chart? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  6. Should the legend be included in the chart, or is it unnecessary since the labels
  on the x-axis are self-explanatory?

  the data?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and title?'
