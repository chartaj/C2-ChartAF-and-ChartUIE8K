initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization using the given data on SAP press releases.
  The treemap should show the distribution of headlines across different labels such
  as 'Story,' 'Partnership,' and 'Award.' Each section of the treemap should represent
  a different label, with the size of the section corresponding to the number of headlines
  under that label. The purpose is to understand the focus areas in SAP's press releases.
  Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret, highlighting key categories. Use
  color coding to differentiate between the various labels.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different labels in the treemap?

  2. Would you like the labels to be displayed inside each section of the treemap
  or as a tooltip?

  3. Do you want the sections to have borders to clearly distinguish between different
  labels?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text within the treemap?

  5. Is there a particular layout algorithm you want to use for the treemap (e.g.,
  squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  6. How do you want to handle labels with very few headlines that may result in very
  small sections?

  7. Should any labels be highlighted or emphasized more than others based on their
  importance to your analysis?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding used for the different
  labels?'
