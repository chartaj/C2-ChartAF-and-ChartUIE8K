initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing fallen meteorites by their class. Highlight
  classes with the highest mass and annotate with their names and masses to show their
  significance. Use different colors to distinguish classes and ensure the chart emphasizes
  notable data points. The purpose is to understand which meteorite classes are predominant
  by mass, assisting in research for space and astronomy studies. The chart should
  allow viewers to quickly see which meteorite types are most common and significant
  by their mass contributions without needing further context explanation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  meteorite classes?

  2. Do you prefer the bars to be horizontal or vertical?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend for the class colors?

  4. Should there be gridlines in the chart to help with readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the annotations and
  labels?

  6. Would you like to display the exact values of the masses on top of the bars or
  within the bars?

  7. Do you have a preferred order for the bars (e.g., ascending, descending by mass)?

  8. Should we include axis titles and labels, and if so, do you have specific titles
  in mind?

  9. Do you want to see any additional statistical data or summaries on the chart,
  such as the total number of meteorites per class?

  10. Would you like to apply any specific formatting to the bar edges or borders
  for better distinction?'
