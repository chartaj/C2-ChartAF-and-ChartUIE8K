initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showcasing fallen meteorites globally.
  Use the `lat` and `long` columns for geolocation data to plot the meteorite falls
  on a world map. The 'mass' column should control the intensity of each point, indicating
  the range and size of meteorite falls. Ensure the `fall`, `year`, and `class` columns
  are also represented in some form such as color-coding or filtering options for
  deeper insight into the data trends related to fallen meteorites over time and their
  classification.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific type of map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  3. How would you prefer ''fall'' types to be color-coded on the map?

  4. Should the size of the data points vary with the ''mass'' of the meteorites?

  5. Do you have a preference on how the ''year'' data should be represented (e.g.,
  color gradient, time slider)?

  6. Would you like to be able to filter data by specific ''class'' of meteorites?

  7. Should the map include labels or tooltips showing additional information when
  hovering over a point?

  8. Do you have a preference for the background style of the map (e.g., satellite,
  streets, terrain)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color and size scales?

  10. Is there any additional contextual information you would like to be displayed
  on the map?'
