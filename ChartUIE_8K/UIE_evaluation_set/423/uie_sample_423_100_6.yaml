initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of meteorite falls by
  geographical location (latitude and longitude). Use the 'lat' and 'long' columns
  to plot the coordinates on the map. Color intensity should represent the density
  of meteorite falls, with darker colors indicating higher density. Additionally,
  include a time dimension using the 'year' column to show how the density of meteorite
  falls has changed over different periods. This way, we can observe any patterns
  or trends in meteorite falls over time and their geographical clustering around
  the world.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How many time periods do you want to segment the data into (e.g., by decade,
  century, etc.)?

  3. Should the map include geographical labels such as country borders or cities?

  4. Do you have any preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color intensity?

  6. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or markers for significant
  meteorite falls?

  7. Are there any specific regions or time periods you would like to highlight?

  8. Do you prefer a static heatmap or one with an option to animate the changes over
  time?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, maybe by decade or century.

  3. Yes, the map should include geographical labels such as country borders.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, a legend to explain the color intensity would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure, no specific regions or time periods come to mind.

  8. I am looking for a static heatmap.'
