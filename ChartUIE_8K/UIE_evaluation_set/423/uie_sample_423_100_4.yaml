initial_prompt: I'd like a histogram to visualize the distribution of meteorite falls
  over the years. Use the 'year' column for the x-axis to show the range of years,
  and the y-axis should show the number of meteorites that fell in each year. The
  data relates to fallen meteorites, so color the bars related to the 'fall' column
  where 'Fell' is one color. The histogram will give insights into how meteorite falls
  have varied or clustered over time. Ensure all missing values are handled appropriately.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color for the bars representing the ''Fell''
  category?

  2. What range of years would you like to visualize in the histogram?

  3. How would you prefer to handle the missing values in the ''year'' column?

  4. Do you want to include a legend or label to indicate what the colored bars represent?

  5. Is there a specific bin width or number of bins you prefer for the histogram?

  6. Would you like to see any specific annotations or markers on the histogram to
  highlight particular years or events?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or labels of the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  8. Are there any other specific stylistic preferences you have for the overall design
  of the histogram (e.g., font type, size, grid lines)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like to visualize data from the earliest recorded year to the most recent
  year in the dataset.

  3. Please exclude any entries with missing values in the ''year'' column.

  4. Yes, include a legend to indicate what the colored bars represent.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific preferences for the title or labels of the axes.

  8. I do not have any specific stylistic preferences.'
