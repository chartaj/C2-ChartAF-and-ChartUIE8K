initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot to visualize fallen meteorites data.
  Plot ''year'' on the x-axis and ''mass'' on the y-axis. Use annotations to highlight
  notable points, such as those with the largest mass or specific historical years.
  Purpose: To analyze trends and significant meteorite hits over time in space and
  astronomy. Highlight differences in mass and distribution across years. Add non-data-driven
  annotations for context and historical significance. Ensure the scatter plot is
  visually clear and focuses attention on key data points.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the data points or the
  background?

  2. Would you prefer a particular style or format for the annotations?

  3. Are there specific historical years or meteorites that you want to ensure are
  highlighted?

  4. Do you have a preferred font type and size for the text in the chart?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or labels for the axes? If so, do you have
  a specific preference for their position or style?

  6. Should the scatter plot include grid lines? If yes, what style or color do you
  prefer?

  7. Are there any particular thresholds for mass or years that you want to be visually
  distinguished in the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart title and subtitle (if any)?

  9. Should the size of the data points vary based on another variable, such as ''mass''?
