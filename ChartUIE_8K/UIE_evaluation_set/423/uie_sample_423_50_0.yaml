initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the mass of fallen meteorites over
  the years. Highlight significant drops or peaks. Include text annotations for notable
  meteorite falls. Also, show the total count of meteorites per year for context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Should the significant drops or peaks be highlighted with specific colors or
  markers?

  3. What style of text annotations would you prefer for notable meteorite falls (e.g.,
  font size, color, position)?

  4. How would you like the total count of meteorites per year to be displayed (e.g.,
  a secondary y-axis, bar chart overlay)?

  5. Are there any specific years or events you already know that should definitely
  be annotated?

  6. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., dashed, solid) for different data
  series?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between mass and count data?

  8. Are there any axis labels or titles that you prefer to be used in the chart?

  9. What level of detail do you prefer for the x-axis labels (e.g., every year, every
  decade)?

  10. Is there a specific chart layout (e.g., aspect ratio, grid lines) that you favor?'
