initial_prompt: '<start of user emulated instruction>

  Create a hexagonal binning chart using the provided data focusing on ''x'' and ''y''
  values to visualize density patterns. Annotate specific high-density areas to highlight
  critical observations.

  <end of user emulated instruction>'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the hexagonal
  bins?

  2. Would you like to specify the number of bins or let it be auto-calculated?

  3. How would you prefer the high-density areas to be annotated? (e.g., labels, different
  colors, contour lines)

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis scales (e.g., logarithmic,
  linear)?

  5. Should gridlines be included on the chart?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  text for them?

  7. Is there a specific range for the ''x'' and ''y'' axes that you would like to
  focus on?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the density levels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Labels for high-density areas.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. Title: "Hexagonal Binning Chart
  for ''x'' and ''y'' Values''. Axis labels: ''x'' and ''y''.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to explain the density levels.'
