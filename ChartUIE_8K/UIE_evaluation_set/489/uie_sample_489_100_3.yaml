initial_prompt: Please create a contour plot using the provided dataset. The CSV contains
  two columns, 'x' and 'y', both of which are of type float64 and have no missing
  values. For the plot, 'x' should represent the horizontal axis while 'y' should
  represent the vertical axis. Ensure that the contour levels are labeled for better
  readability. Adjust the color scheme to visually differentiate between different
  contour levels. I want the contour plot to clearly represent the distribution and
  relationship between these two variables. Add a color bar for reference alongside
  the plot.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  contour plot?

  2. Are there any specific contour levels you would like to be highlighted or emphasized?

  3. How many contour levels would you prefer to have in the plot?

  4. Would you like the plot to have any specific title or axis labels beyond ''x''
  and ''y''?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the contour level labels and axis
  labels?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement or orientation of the color
  bar?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot for better readability?

  8. Are there any specific data points or ranges of interest that you would like
  to be annotated?'
