initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the data from the provided CSV file.
  The x-axis should represent the 'name' column, and the y-axis should represent the
  'n' column. Since the data is about the number of names by year and sex, highlight

  with appropriate labels and colors. Thank you!
