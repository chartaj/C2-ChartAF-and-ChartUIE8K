initial_prompt: Hi, I have a dataset related to baby names across different years,
  detailing attributes such as year, sex, and the name's popularity. I would like
  to visualize this data using a Treemap. Could you create a Treemap that shows the
  proportion of different names (prop) within each year, distinguished by sex? The
  color might represent different names, and the size of each block should represent
  the name's proportion (prop) within that year. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  names?

  2. Would you like the Treemap to be segmented first by year or by sex?

  3. Do you prefer any specific layout style for the Treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  4. Should there be specific labels or annotations for each block in the Treemap?

  5. How granular would you like the year segments to be (e.g., individual years,
  decades)?

  6. Do you want a legend included in the visualization? If yes, any preference for
  its placement?

  7. Are there any specific names or categories you want to emphasize in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the Treemap to be segmented first by year.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, I would like labels showing the names and proportions within each block.

  5. Individual years would be great.

  6. Yes, please include a legend, but I have no specific preference for its placement.

  7. I have no specific names or categories to emphasize.'
