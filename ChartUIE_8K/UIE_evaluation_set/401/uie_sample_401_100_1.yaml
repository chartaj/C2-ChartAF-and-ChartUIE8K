initial_prompt: Visualize the number of female names over the years using a line chart.
  Highlight key changes in the frequency of popular names like Helen, Amanda, and
  Betty. Annotate years with significant drops or rises in these namesâ€™ occurrences.
  This will help to quickly understand trends in naming preferences. Include annotations
  that describe trends or unusual patterns, and use highlights to make the most frequently
  occurring names stand out. This chart will provide valuable insights into how name
  popularity has evolved over time in the social science context.
