initial_prompt: I have a dataset with information on baby names from the year 1880
  including columns for year, sex, name, number of occurrences (n), and proportion
  (prop). I am interested in visualizing how the popularity of various names (specifically
  'Helen', 'Amanda', and 'Betty') compares. Please create a pie chart showing the
  proportion of each name relative to the total occurrences among these names for
  that year, focusing on female names. The chart should be clearly labeled with each
  name and its corresponding proportion.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?\n2. Would you\
  \ like the chart to display the exact proportions as percentage values on each slice?\n\
  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels?\n4. Should the chart\
  \ include a title? If yes, what should the title be?\n5. Do you prefer the chart\
  \ to have a legend alongside the labels on the pie slices? \n6. Are there any specific\
  \ dimensions or aspect ratios you would like for the pie chart?\n7. Do you have\
  \ any preference for the ordering of the name slices in the pie chart (e.g., alphabetical,\
  \ by proportion)?\n8. Should the chart include any annotations or notes for additional\
  \ context?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please display the exact proportions as percentage values on each slice.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Proportion of Female Baby Names in 1880."

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. By proportion would be great.

  8. I do not know.'
