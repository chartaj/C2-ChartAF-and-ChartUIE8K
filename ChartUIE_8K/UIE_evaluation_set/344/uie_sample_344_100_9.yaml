initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the salary data for different blockchain-related
  job titles in various companies and locations across India for 2022. Use "Title"
  on the y-axis and "Location" on the x-axis. The color intensity should represent
  the range between "Salary_Lower_Limit" and "Salary_Upper_Limit." Make sure to highlight
  where "Easy Apply" jobs are available. This visualization should help users quickly
  understand salary trends and readily available positions within the blockchain sector
  in different regions. Use contrasting colors to distinguish salary ranges effectively.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap, particularly
  for distinguishing the salary ranges?

  2. How would you like the "Easy Apply" jobs to be highlighted on the heatmap? Do
  you prefer specific symbols or color overlays?

  3. What should be the range of the color scale used in the heatmap? Do you want
  it to be adjusted to specific salary ranges (e.g., 50,000 INR increments)?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences or size considerations for the axis
  labels ("Title" and "Location") and the legend?

  5. Would you prefer the heatmap to display exact salary values or just color gradients
  to represent salary ranges?

  6. Are there any particular companies or job titles you want to be prominently displayed
  or highlighted in a different way?

  7. Do you want to include any annotations or notes on the heatmap to explain specific
  trends or highlight particular regions and job titles?'
