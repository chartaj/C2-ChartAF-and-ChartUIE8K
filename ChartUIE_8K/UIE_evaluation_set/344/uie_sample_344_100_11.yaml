initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the salary range (Salary_Lower_Limit
  and Salary_Upper_Limit) for different blockchain-related job titles listed in the
  '../Extra_datas/data/344.csv' file. The chart should provide clear insights into
  the salary distribution across various positions in different locations. Ensure
  the job titles are on the x-axis and the salary ranges are represented on the y-axis.
  Highlight key statistics like median salary, interquartile ranges, and any potential
  outliers. Make it visually appealing and easy to understand for potential job seekers
  and employers. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Do you want any specific colors to highlight the median salary and interquartile
  ranges?

  3. Should we include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Would you like to display the data points for outliers explicitly?

  5. Do you have a preference for the box plot orientation (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should we differentiate locations using colors or patterns?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to indicate what each box represents?

  9. Should we add any annotations or specific labels for key statistics?

  10. Would you prefer a minimalist design or a detailed one with more axis markings
  and labels?'
