initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize Blockchain job opportunities in India
  in 2022 using data from Glassdoor.com. The x-axis should represent different job
  titles and the y-axis should represent salary ranges (from Salary_Lower_Limit to
  Salary_Upper_Limit). Different dots can indicate the company offering the job, and
  color-code dots based on the "Easy Apply" option (True or False). Ensure the plot
  includes labels for the job title, company, and location. This visualization will
  help compare salaries and understand which positions offer easier application processes.
  Keep the data points clear and concise for easy interpretation.
