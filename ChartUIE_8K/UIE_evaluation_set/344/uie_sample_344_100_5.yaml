initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of job titles
  from the given data. Highlight the proportions of different roles within the blockchain
  and cryptocurrency sector for jobs in India in 2022 as collected from Glassdoor.com.
  Ensure the chart segments are labeled with the job titles like 'Consultant', 'Blockchain
  Developer Intern', 'Trainer', and any other unique titles available from the dataset.

  the pie slices?

  from most common to least common)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and titles?

  6. Should the chart title include specific details such as the year and location
  (e.g., "Job Title Distribution in India''s Blockchain Sector, 2022")?

  7. Is there a preference for how to handle small proportions in the chart (e.g.,
  grouping them into an ''Other'' category)?

  solely on job titles?'
