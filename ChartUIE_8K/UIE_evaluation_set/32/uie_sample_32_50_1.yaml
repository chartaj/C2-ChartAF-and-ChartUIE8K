initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showcasing medical costs from different
  regions. Highlight regions with the highest charges, especially for smokers. Annotate
  specific data points for age, sex, and smoker status. Use color intensity to depict
  charge variations across regions, making it easier to identify high-cost areas.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the geographic heatmap?

  2. How would you like the highest charges to be highlighted (e.g., specific colors,
  labels)?

  3. Should regions with the highest charges for smokers be differentiated from non-smokers
  in any special way?

  4. Do you have preferences for annotating specific data points for age, sex, and
  smoker status (e.g., format, position)?

  5. Are there any specific regions you are particularly interested in focusing on
  or comparing?

  6. How detailed would you like the regional breakdown to be (e.g., state, city,
  zip code)?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to include legends or additional explanatory notes?

  8. Would you like any specific statistical information or calculations included
  (e.g., average charges per region, percentage of smokers)?

  9. Any preferences for the map projection type or geographic layout?

  10. Are there any additional filters or criteria you would like to apply to the
  data (e.g., age range, gender)?'
