initial_prompt: I want a bar chart to visualize the number of children versus the
  average medical charges. Please annotate the highest and lowest average charges.
  Highlight bars representing smokers versus non-smokers to see the cost impact. This
  chart is for analyzing personal medical costs and should focus on differentiating
  between smokers and non-smokers across different regions aged 18 to 28. Use distinct
  colors for each region to make comparisons easier. This visualization helps in understanding
  how smoking status and region influence medical expenses for families with varying
  numbers of children.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct regions?

  2. What style or design preferences do you have for the annotations of the highest
  and lowest average charges?

  3. Are there specific labels or legends you would like to include for the smoker
  versus non-smoker bars?

  4. Would you prefer the chart to display values directly on the bars or hover-over
  tooltips for the average charges?

  5. Do you have any font preferences for the titles, axis labels, or legends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include labels for "Smoker" and "Non-Smoker".

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not have any font preferences.'
