initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of different regions
  in the Medical Cost Personal Datasets. The donut chart should segment the regions
  ('northwest', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'southwest') based on the count of occurrences
  in the dataset. Highlight each segment with a different color to distinguish between
  the regions clearly. Include labels with the percentage of each region for better
  insight. Ensure the chart is visually appealing and easy to understand for quick
  data interpretation regarding regional distribution in medical cost data. Thank
  you!
