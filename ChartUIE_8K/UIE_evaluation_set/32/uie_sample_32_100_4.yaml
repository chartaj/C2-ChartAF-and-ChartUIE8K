initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trends in medical charges
  based on age, using the data from the Medical Cost Personal Datasets. Ensure the
  line chart shows how charges vary with age and include different lines for male
  and female to compare their medical costs. Additionally, highlight any patterns
  or anomalies, such as the impact of the number of children and smoking status on
  the charges. The chart should help understand how medical expenses change over a
  person's lifetime and the factors influencing these costs. Thank you!

  male and female?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the colors or styles
  of the lines?

  3. Do you prefer the lines to be solid, dashed, or dotted?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific range limits or be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?

  5. Do you want grid lines in the background to make the chart easier to read?

  6. Are there any specific age intervals or bins you would like to use for the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to include data points or markers on the lines?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, what should they
  be?

  or anomalies, such as the impact of smoking status and number of children?
