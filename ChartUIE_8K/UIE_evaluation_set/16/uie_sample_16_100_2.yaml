initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between 'Attack'
  and 'Defense' stats of Pokemon. Annotate selected data points of Pokemon having
  both 'Attack' and 'Defense' greater than 80, displaying their names and stats. Apply
  highlights with increased point size and different colors for 'Legendary' Pokemon
  to distinguish them from non-legendary ones. The visualization should facilitate
  quick identification of Pokemon with high stats and distinguish legendary ones for
  better insights. This chart serves for comparative analysis and highlighting stand-out
  Pokemon, within the arts and entertainment context. Make it visually appealing and
  informative.
