initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the stats of the three Pokémon
  noted (Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur). Specifically, plot the 'Total', 'HP', 'Attack',
  'Defense', 'Sp. Atk', 'Sp. Def', and 'Speed' for each Pokémon. Mark the X-axis with
  the Pokémon names and the Y-axis with their respective stat values. This will help
  compare their stats visually.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the line styles or colors for each Pokémon?

  2. Do you want grid lines to be shown on the chart?

  3. Would you prefer data point markers on the lines, and if so, any specific style
  or shape?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to identify each stat category?

  6. Do you want any annotations or data labels on specific data points in the chart?

  7. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?

  8. Do you require any particular axis scaling or limits?

  9. Would you like the chart to include any tooltips or hover elements for better
  clarity (ignoring interactivity aspects solely for display)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the chart background color or overall theme (dark,
  light, etc.)?'
