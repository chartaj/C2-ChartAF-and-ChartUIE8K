initial_prompt: I would like to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of
  various Pokémon stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed.
  Please annotate specific points of interest, like exceptionally high or low values.
  Highlight Generation and Legendary status for better insights. This visualization
  will help in understanding the overall trends and identifying unique or outlier
  Pokémon. Create separate histograms for each stat category and include text annotations
  to emphasize any notable data points. Make sure the chart is visually appealing
  and easy to interpret for an audience interested in Pokémon data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. Would you like to use specific colors to highlight different Generations and
  Legendary status?

  3. How would you prefer the histograms to be labelled and annotated? Any specific
  font size or style?

  4. Should the bins in the histograms have a specific width, or would you prefer
  an automatic binning?

  5. Do you have any preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Are there any particular Pokémon or stat values you would like to be specifically
  annotated?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a preferred color scheme.

  2. Yes, different colors for Generations and Legendary status would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure about the specific font size or style, but it should be clear and
  readable.

  4. I do not know about the bin width; automatic binning should be fine.

  5. I have no specific preference for the position of the legend.

  6. I am not sure about any particular Pokémon or stat values to annotate, but highlighting
  any exceptionally high or low values would be great.'
