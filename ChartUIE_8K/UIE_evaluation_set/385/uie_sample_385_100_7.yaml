initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize military expenditure
  by country and continent. The y-axis should represent the military expenditure in
  million USD, and the x-axis should be divided into different continents. Each continent
  should have bars representing the countries within it. Use distinct colors for each
  country to help differentiate them. This chart will help us compare military expenditures
  across countries within each continent. Ensure all labels and legends are clear
  to make the chart easy to understand. Use the data from the provided CSV file.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different countries?

  2. What style and size of the font would you prefer for the labels and legends?

  3. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart or axes?

  4. Do you need data values displayed on the bars, or is it sufficient to have them
  on the y-axis?

  5. Should there be any specific ordering of the countries within each continent
  (e.g., descending by expenditure)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific spacing between the grouped bars or between the groups
  themselves?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines for the chart''s aspect ratio or dimensions?'
