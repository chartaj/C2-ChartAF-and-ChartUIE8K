initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the military expenditure for
  different countries across various continents based on the given data. Each segment
  of the donut chart should represent a countryâ€™s military expenditure in million
  USD, with slices grouped by continent. The chart should clearly label each segment
  with the country name and the expenditure amount, as well as use different colors
  to distinguish between continents. Ensure that the legend clearly indicates which
  color corresponds to which continent. This will help in understanding the distribution
  of military spending globally.
