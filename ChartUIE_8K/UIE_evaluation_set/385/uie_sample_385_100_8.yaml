initial_prompt: I need a radar chart to compare military expenditures of different
  countries across various continents. The data includes the country names, their
  military expenditures in million USD, and their respective continents. Please plot
  the radar chart with countries on each axis, showing their military expenditures,
  and group them by continent. This will help illustrate how military spending differs
  not only by country but also across continents. Make sure to differentiate continents
  using distinct colors or markers. I want to clearly see which continents have higher
  military spenders. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating continents?

  2. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to add to the chart?

  3. Would you prefer a legend placed in a specific location on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for text on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific markers or patterns you prefer for distinguishing between
  continents?

  6. Would you like to include axis lines and gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you need any annotations or data points highlighted on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the countries to be displayed on
  the radar chart?'
