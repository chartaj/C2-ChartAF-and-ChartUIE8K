initial_prompt: Create a dumbbell chart to visualize the gender wage gap (%) over
  the years for Brazil. Include data-driven text annotations to highlight key years
  and values. Use highlights to emphasize significant changes. The goal is to illustrate
  trends in gender economic inequality.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlights to emphasize
  significant changes?

  2. Would you like to set a particular range or interval for the years on the x-axis?

  3. Are there any specific years you want to ensure are annotated with data-driven
  text?

  4. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the text annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a grid for easier reading of values, or do you prefer
  a cleaner look without it?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or style of the points or markers
  on the dumbbell chart?

  7. What level of detail do you want for the y-axis labels (e.g., one decimal point,
  no decimal points, etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle to provide context about the
  data being visualized?

  9. Do you want to include a legend that explains the highlights and annotations,
  or do you think it would be unnecessary?'
