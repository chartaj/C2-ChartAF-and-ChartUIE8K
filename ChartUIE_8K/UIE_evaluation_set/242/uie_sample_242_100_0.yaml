initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the gender wage gap percentages over
  the years for Brazil. The X-axis should represent the years (1981, 1982, 1983),
  while the Y-axis should show the gender wage gap percentages (34.21%, 33.66%, 35.75%).
  Please include text annotations on key data points to highlight significant changes,
  particularly the dip in 1982. This visualization aims to help in understanding trends
  in gender economic inequality over time. Use color highlights to draw attention
  to years with the highest and lowest wage gaps for easy comparison.

  2. Do you have specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like the X-axis and Y-axis to include grid lines?

  4. Do you prefer any specific markers for the key data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  6. Do you want any specific legends or labels on the chart?

  7. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the annotations on significant
  changes?

  8. Should the chart include a background color or should it be plain?

  9. Do you want to include a reference line for the average gender wage gap percentage?'
