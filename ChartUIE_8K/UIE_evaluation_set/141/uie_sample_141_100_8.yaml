initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot using the "Economic Freedom of the World"
  data. The x-axis should represent the "countries" while the y-axis depicts the "ECONOMIC
  FREEDOM" scores for the year 2016. Points should be color-coded based on the "quartile"
  they belong to. Make sure to label the axes clearly and provide a legend indicating
  the quartiles. Display the top 10 countries with the highest economic freedom scores
  and ensure the plot is easy to interpret with adequately spaced points for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  plot?

  2. What font type and size would you prefer for axis labels and legends?

  3. Should the top 10 countries be highlighted in any particular manner (e.g., bold
  labels, larger points)?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., side, bottom)?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or notes on the chart?

  6. Is there a particular way you want the points to be spaced for better clarity?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall chart size or aspect ratio?

  8. Should the country names on the x-axis be at an angle for better readability?

  9. Would you like grid lines on the plot, and if so, in what style (e.g., dashed,
  solid)?

  10. Is there any particular order in which you want the countries to be displayed
  (e.g., alphabetically, score-based)?'
