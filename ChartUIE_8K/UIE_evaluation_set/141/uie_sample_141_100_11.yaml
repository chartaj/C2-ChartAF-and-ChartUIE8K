initial_prompt: I need a Choropleth map visualizing the Economic Freedom of the World
  dataset. Please use the "ISO_code" to represent countries and color the map based
  on the "ECONOMIC FREEDOM" scores from the dataset. The map should show the economic
  freedom scores for the year 2016. Include a legend to indicate what the colors represent
  in terms of Economic Freedom scores. Ensure that higher scores are depicted in shades
  of green and lower scores in shades of red. The color transition should be smooth
  to reflect subtle differences in economic freedom between countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  2. Would you like to include country borders or boundaries on the map?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style and size for country labels and the legend?

  4. Is there a specific range of values you would like to highlight or annotate on
  the map?

  5. Do you have a maximum or minimum threshold for the economic freedom scores''
  colors?

  6. Would you like to add tooltips or labels for additional country-specific information
  when the user hovers over a country (e.g., rank or quartile)?

  7. Do you have a preferred title or caption for the map?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or callout boxes for specific countries?

  9. Would you like the legend to be placed in a specific position (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left) on the map?

  10. Is there any specific color gradient you prefer for the shades of green and
  red?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include country borders.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific threshold in mind.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. "Economic Freedom of the World: 2016"

  8. No, I do not need additional annotations.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Use a smooth gradient transitioning from red (low scores) to green (high scores).
