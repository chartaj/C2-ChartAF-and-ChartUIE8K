initial_prompt: I need an area chart comparing the Economic Freedom scores of different
  countries over a span of years. Annotate the years where significant changes occur
  for specific countries and highlight the top and bottom countries in terms of Economic
  Freedom. For example, highlight Algeria and Albania for contrast. Utilize the quartile
  ranks to shade different areas of Economic Freedom. Additionally, mark outliers
  in transfers and government consumption for further context. Make the chart interactive
  to explore detailed scores for property rights, sound money, and trade freedom.
  Keep it intuitive and highly visual.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should specific countries other than Algeria and Albania be highlighted as well?

  3. How would you like the significant changes to be annotated (e.g., arrows, text
  labels)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the type of shading to represent quartile ranks?

  5. How would you like outliers in transfers and government consumption to be marked
  (e.g., different color, icon)?

  6. Would you like any specific legends or labels for different sections of the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style or format for the axis labels and titles?'
