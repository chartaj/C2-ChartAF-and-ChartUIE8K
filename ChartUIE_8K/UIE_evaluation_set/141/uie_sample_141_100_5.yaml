initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the Economic Freedom of the World dataset.
  Use the 'year' column for the x-axis and 'countries' for the y-axis. The color intensity
  should represent the 'ECONOMIC FREEDOM' scores. Ensure missing values are appropriately
  handled or denoted. Highlight countries in the top and bottom quartiles distinctly

  Make sure the heatmap is clear, informative, and easily interpretable, emphasizing
  trends over the years.
