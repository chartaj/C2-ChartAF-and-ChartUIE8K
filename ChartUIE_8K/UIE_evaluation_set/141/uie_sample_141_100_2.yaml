initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of "ECONOMIC
  FREEDOM" scores from the provided data. Highlight the quartiles using distinct colors
  to emphasize the different ranges of economic freedom among the countries. Use text
  annotations to label the mean score and a few data points from each quartile to
