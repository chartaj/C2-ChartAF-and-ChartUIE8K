initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the "ECONOMIC FREEDOM" scores for
  various countries in 2016 from the data provided. Could you also include each country's
  "rank" as a secondary axis or label? I want to clearly see which countries have
  the highest and lowest economic freedom scores and their respective ranks for the
  given year. Make sure the country names are properly labeled on the x-axis and the
  economic freedom scores are on the y-axis. The chart should be easy to read and
  visually appealing, using distinct colors for each bar. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or palette preference for the bars?

  2. Should the bars be sorted by "ECONOMIC FREEDOM" scores in ascending or descending
  order, or should they remain unsorted?

  3. Do you prefer the secondary axis for "rank" to be on the left, right, or as a
  label above each bar?

  4. How much spacing would you like between the bars?

  5. Is there a desired font style or size for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you like any gridlines for better readability? If so, do you have a preference
  for their style (dashed, solid, etc.)?

  7. Should the chart include any additional annotations or highlights for the countries
  with the highest and lowest scores?

  8. Is there a required legend to differentiate any categories or data points?

  9. What title would you prefer for the chart? Should it include a subtitle for additional
  information or context?'
