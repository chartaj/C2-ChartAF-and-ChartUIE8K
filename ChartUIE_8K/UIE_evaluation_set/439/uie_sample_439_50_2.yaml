initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showing regions with endangered plants. Highlight
  continents and countries with the most extinct species using color variations. Annotate
  notable data points like countries with the highest threats and actions taken. This
  will visually emphasize regions most affected by plant extinction.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for highlighting
  the continents and countries?

  2. Would you prefer a gradient color variation based on the number of extinct species,
  or do you have specific colors for different categories?

  3. How would you like the annotations for notable data points to be displayed (e.g.,
  tooltips, labels directly on the map, a legend)?

  4. Are there any specific actions taken that you want to be highlighted more prominently
  than others?

  5. Do you have preferences for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  6. Would you like any additional information or context to be included in a legend
  or sidebar?

  7. Are there any geographical regions or countries you want to emphasize or make
  more prominent on the map?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scale and granularity of the map (e.g., detailed
  country borders vs. more simplified outlines)?'
