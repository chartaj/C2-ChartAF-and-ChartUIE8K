initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the extinction threat levels for
  different plant species across various continents. Use `year_last_seen` and `red_list_category`
  as your axes. Differentiate points by `continent`. Highlight specific threats such
  as `threat_ISGD`, `threat_GE`, and `threat_EPM` using different markers or colors.
  Include a legend to identify these threats. The focus should be on illustrating
  which continents and time periods have seen higher extinction rates and the associated
  threats. This will help in understanding the impact of various threats on plant
  species over time.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for differentiating the continents?

  2. Do you have a preferred marker style or shape for highlighting specific threats
  (`threat_ISGD`, `threat_GE`, `threat_EPM`)?

  3. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?

  4. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Would you like a grid to be displayed on the chart background for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific orientation (horizontal or vertical) for the x-axis
  (`year_last_seen`) labels?

  7. Should the chart include annotations or labels for specific data points of interest?

  8. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like for the chart or the
  axes?

  9. How do you want missing values (if any) to be handled or represented in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include a trend line to help visualize the trend over time?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer circles for `threat_ISGD`, squares for `threat_GE`, and triangles for
  `threat_EPM`.

  3. Top right would be great for the legend.

  4. I do not know, no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a grid for better readability.

  6. Horizontal orientation for the x-axis labels is preferable.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No specific titles or subtitles for now.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, including a trend line would be helpful.'
