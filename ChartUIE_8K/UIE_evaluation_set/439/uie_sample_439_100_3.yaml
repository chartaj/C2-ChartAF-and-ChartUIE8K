initial_prompt: I need a dot plot visualizing the "Plants in danger" data. Plot the
  x-axis as "year_last_seen" (grouped like '2000-2020', '1980-1999', etc.) and the
  y-axis as the number of plant species. Differentiate the dots by "continent" and
  color-code them accordingly. Also, indicate the "red_list_category" by using different
  shapes for the dots (e.g., circle for 'Extinct' and square for 'Extinct in the Wild').
  This way, we can quickly identify which continents have the most extinct plants
  and in what years. Make sure everything is clear and well-labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating continents?

  2. Are there specific shapes you would like for different ''red_list_category''
  values aside from circles and squares?

  3. How would you like the labels for the axes to be formatted?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the title of the chart?

  5. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  6. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?

  7. Would you prefer gridlines on the chart for easier readability?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights on the chart for certain data
  points or ranges?

  9. How detailed would you like the axis ticks and grid intervals to be?

  10. Would you like a specific background color for the chart to enhance readability?'
