initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showing the extinction status of plant species
  across different continents. Highlight continents based on the number of extinct
  species, with a gradient color scale indicating higher concentrations. Add text
  annotations to pinpoint specific countries with a notable number of extinctions.
  This will help environmental scientists visualize which regions have been most affected
  by plant extinctions, drawing attention to areas needing conservation efforts. Additionally,
  highlight countries with unique threats such as "Industrial & Residential Development"
  or "Climate Change" to emphasize patterns. Ensure the map is visually engaging for
  easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the gradient color scale
  indicating higher concentrations of extinct species?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the gradient color scale?

  3. Are there particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations include additional information such as exact numbers
  of extinct species or just the names of the countries?

  5. Do you prefer any specific map projection for the Choropleth map?

  6. Are there specific symbols or markers you would like to use to highlight countries
  with unique threats like "Industrial & Residential Development" or "Climate Change"?

  7. Would you like to include tooltips for more detailed information upon hovering
  over a country or continent?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a legend.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Include the names of the countries and the exact numbers of extinct species.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No, tooltips are not needed.'
