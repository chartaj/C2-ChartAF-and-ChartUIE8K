initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize electric vehicle population data across different
  counties in the state. Can you create a histogram that shows the count of electric
  vehicles (both BEVs and PHEVs) in each county? I want to see how the penetration
  of electric vehicles varies by county. Please make sure each bar represents a different
  county and the height of the bar reflects the total number of electric vehicles
  (EV Total). The x-axis should list the counties and the y-axis should represent
  the number of electric vehicles. The chart title should be "Electric Vehicle Distribution
  Across Counties".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the histogram?

  2. Would you like the counties on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific order,
  such as alphabetical or by EV count?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the chart to improve readability?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  5. Do you want to include any additional annotations or data labels on the bars?

  6. Should the y-axis use a linear or logarithmic scale?

  7. Do you have a preference for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, even though this is a single-series histogram?

  9. Are there any specific counties you want to highlight or emphasize in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Linear scale sounds good.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No need for a legend.

  9. No, I don''t have any specific counties to highlight.'
