initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of Electric Vehicles
  (EVs), both BEVs and PHEVs, across counties in Washington State as of February 29,
  2020. Use color intensity to indicate the total count of EVs in each county, highlighting
  counties with higher counts. Include annotations for counties with the highest and
  lowest percentages of EVs, focusing attention on these key data points. The purpose
  is to visually represent the spread and adoption rate of EVs across different regions
  for easy comparison and analysis. The chart should be informative for stakeholders
  interested in the electric vehicle market.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the color intensity range?

  3. How should the annotation for counties with the highest and lowest percentages
  of EVs be displayed (e.g., text size, color, position)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color intensity?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Should the heatmap be accompanied by any specific titles or subtitles?

  7. Is there a specific arrangement or order in which the counties should be displayed?

  8. Do you prefer to highlight counties with the highest and lowest counts in any
  particular way other than annotations (e.g., border color)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like the annotations to be in a bold font and red color, positioned near
  the counties with arrows pointing to them.

  4. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color intensity.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for font style and size.

  6. Yes, please include a title like "Distribution of EVs in Washington State (Feb
  29, 2020)" and a subtitle "Concentration of BEVs and PHEVs by County".

  7. I do not know.

  8. I prefer to highlight counties with the highest and lowest counts using a distinct
  border color, such as black.'
