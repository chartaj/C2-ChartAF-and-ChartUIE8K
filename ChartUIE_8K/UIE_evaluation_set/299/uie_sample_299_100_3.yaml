initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the electric vehicle population
  over time in different counties. Use the data from `../Extra_datas/data/299.csv`,
  particularly focusing on the columns "Date," "County," "Electric Vehicle (EV) Total,"
  and "Percent Electric Vehicles." Plot the "Date" on the x-axis and the "Electric
  Vehicle (EV) Total" and "Percent Electric Vehicles" on the y-axes for each county.
  This will help illustrate the changes in EV population and their percentage over
  time across various locations. The chart should be easy to read and compare different
  counties.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different counties?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer separate charts for "Electric Vehicle (EV) Total" and "Percent
  Electric Vehicles" or combined in a dual-axis chart?

  4. Should the legend be positioned in a specific area of the chart?

  5. Would you like any specific line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) to differentiate
  between counties?

  6. What level of detail do you want for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g., yearly,
  quarterly)?

  7. Do you prefer data points to be marked with symbols besides the lines?

  8. Should there be specific annotations or labels on notable data points or trends?

  9. Do you have a preferred font style and size for labels and titles?

  10. Would you like to display the exact values of "Electric Vehicle (EV) Total"
  and "Percent Electric Vehicles" on the graph dynamically?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I prefer a dual-axis chart with both "Electric Vehicle (EV) Total" and "Percent
  Electric Vehicles" combined.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yearly detail for the date labels on the x-axis would be preferred.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific annotations or labels in mind.

  9. I do not know.

  10. No, the exact values do not need to be displayed dynamically on the graph.'
