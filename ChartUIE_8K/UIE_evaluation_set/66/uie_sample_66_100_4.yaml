initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the trends in consumer electronics
  sales. I want to see how the average ProductPrice changes over different CustomerAges.
  Show lines for different ProductCategories, like Smartphones, Smart Watches, and
  Tablets. This should help us understand if certain age groups are spending more
  on specific electronics over time. Include labels and a legend for clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing different ProductCategories?

  2. Would you like to see any specific age ranges highlighted on the chart?

  3. Are there any particular grid settings you prefer (e.g., major or minor grid
  lines)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for
  better distinction between ProductCategories?

  5. Would you like to include data points on the lines to mark specific values?

  6. Do you have any font preferences for the labels and legend?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Would you like to display the average ProductPrice as a tooltip when hovering
  over the lines?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the scaling of the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?'
