initial_prompt: Can you create a bar chart to visualize the Boston Housing dataset?
  Specifically, I'd like to see a comparison between the average Room count (RM),
  Lower status of the population (LSTAT), and Pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO) for different
  median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) categories. Please group MEDV into categories
  like low, medium, high, etc., and present the average values for each category.
  Use distinct colors for each category to differentiate them clearly. This will help
  in understanding how these variables relate to different housing price ranges. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the bar chart?

  2. What specific categories would you like to use for grouping the MEDV values (e.g.,
  specific thresholds for low, medium, high)?

  3. Are there any specific colors you prefer for each MEDV category?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart?

  5. Would you like to include labels for the data points on the bars?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style for the chart labels and
  title?

  7. Should the average values be displayed directly on the bars or as a tooltip on
  hover?

  8. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the visualization?

  9. Would you like a legend included to indicate what each color represents in terms
  of MEDV categories?

  10. Is there a specific order in which you would like the categories to be displayed
  (e.g., ascending or descending)?'
