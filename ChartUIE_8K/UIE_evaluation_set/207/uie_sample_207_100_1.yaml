initial_prompt: Let's create a dot plot using the provided Boston Housing dataset.
  X-axis represents 'RM' (average number of rooms per dwelling) and Y-axis represents
  'MEDV' (Median value of owner-occupied homes in USD). Use 'LSTAT' (lower status
  of the population) and 'PTRATIO' (pupil-teacher ratio) as annotations for each dot
  to highlight housing quality and education access. This visualization will help
  analyze the relationship between room numbers and property value, emphasizing areas
  with diverse economic statuses and education levels. Include highlights on points
  where 'MEDV' is exceptionally high or low to focus on outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the dots or annotations?

  2. Would you like to use different colors or shapes for highlighting outliers with
  exceptionally high or low ''MEDV'' values?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations (''LSTAT''
  and ''PTRATIO'')?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  5. Would you like data points to be labeled with specific identifiers (e.g., neighborhood
  names)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific ranges or intervals for the X-axis (''RM'') and Y-axis
  (''MEDV'')?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to explain the annotations and highlights used
  in the chart?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds for ''LSTAT'' and ''PTRATIO'' that you would
  like to be highlighted differently?

  9. Would you like tooltips or data labels to appear when hovering over individual
  dots for additional information display?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, using different colors for highlighting outliers would be great.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, including gridlines would enhance readability.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have specific ranges or intervals.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the annotations and highlights.

  8. I am not sure about specific thresholds.

  9. I do not know, since I am looking for an image and not an interactive visualization.'
