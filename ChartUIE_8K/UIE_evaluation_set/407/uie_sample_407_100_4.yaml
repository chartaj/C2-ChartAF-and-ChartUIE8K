initial_prompt: I need a candlestick chart to visualize the coin price data for 10
  months based on "../Extra_datas/data/407.csv". The chart should use the 'date' as
  the x-axis and 'value' as the y-axis to show the price trend of cryptocurrency over
  time. Ensure the candlesticks clearly display daily price changes. The details should
  be practical, reflecting real-world fluctuations in coin prices. Add necessary labels
  and titles to make the chart understandable. This visualization should help in analyzing
  the price trend for the given period efficiently.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like any particular color scheme for the candlesticks?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines on the chart?

  5. Should we include any specific annotations or markers on the chart?

  6. Are there any particular date formats you prefer for the x-axis?

  7. Do you have preferences for the width or spacing of the candlesticks?

  8. Would you like to add a legend to the chart?

  9. Should we highlight or distinguish weekends or holidays in any specific way?

  10. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text elements?'
