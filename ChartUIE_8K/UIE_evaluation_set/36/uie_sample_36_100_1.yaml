initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap of house sales in King County, USA. Show
  data points for price, bedrooms, and bathrooms using color intensity to reflect
  price differences. Annotate selected high-price areas to focus attention on them.
  Include highlights for major variations in sqft_living and sqft_lot sizes. The purpose
  is to visualize property value distribution and identify high-value clusters. Use
  data from the provided dataset to inform the visualization, ensuring it is practical
  for real estate market analysis. Include relevant non-data annotations to give context
  about the dataset's timeframe and features.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for the heatmap?

  2. What level of color intensity granularity would you like for price differences?

  3. Are there specific annotations you would like to include for high-price areas?

  4. How would you prefer the variations in ''sqft_living'' and ''sqft_lot'' to be
  highlighted?

  5. Do you have a preference for the map style or background (e.g., satellite view,
  street view)?

  6. What timeframe should the non-data annotations cover?

  7. Are there any particular features or details about the dataset you would like
  emphasized in the annotations?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the level of color intensity granularity for price differences.

  3. I would like annotations for high-price areas to mention the neighborhood names
  and median prices.

  4. I do not know, maybe just different color shades or intensity?

  5. Street view would be fine.

  6. The timeframe should cover the last 5 years.

  7. Emphasize the total number of houses sold and the average price, bedrooms, and
  bathrooms in the dataset.'
