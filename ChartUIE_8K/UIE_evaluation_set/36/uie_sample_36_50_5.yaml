initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart showing the distribution of houses sold
  by number of bedrooms and price range. Use the "price" as the y-axis, "bedrooms"
  as the x-axis, and stack by the "bathrooms". This will help visualize which types
  of homes are more prevalent in King County.

  3. Should the chart include data labels for each segment in the columns?

  4. Would you prefer any specific ordering for the categories on the x-axis?

  5. Do you need a legend to differentiate between the different numbers of bathrooms?

  6. Should there be any specific title or labels for the chart and axes?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds or reference lines you want to include on the
  chart? For example, an average price line.

  8. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the chart text elements?
