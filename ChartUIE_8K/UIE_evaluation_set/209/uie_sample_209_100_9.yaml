initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the New York Housing Market dataset.
  Highlight correlations between PROPERTY SQFT, PRICE, BEDS, and BATHS across various
  localities. Use different shades to show high and low valuesâ€”darker shades for higher
  values and lighter for lower. Ensure the heatmap includes labels for the types of
  properties, such as Condos and Houses. The goal is to easily identify trends and
  outliers in the housing market. Also, include state and locality information for
  more insightful analysis. This will help in understanding where larger, more expensive
  homes are located.

  heatmap?

  2. What size and resolution do you prefer for the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or markers for outliers?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like any additional legends or explanations included for better understanding
  of the color gradations?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds for ''high'' and ''low'' values that you would
  like us to use for the different shades?

  8. Should the labels for property types (e.g., Condos, Houses) be prominently displayed
  in a particular way?

  9. Is there a need to group or categorize localities in any specific manner on the
  heatmap?

  10. Are there any other specific visual elements you would like to include to enhance
  the interpretability for your target audience?'
