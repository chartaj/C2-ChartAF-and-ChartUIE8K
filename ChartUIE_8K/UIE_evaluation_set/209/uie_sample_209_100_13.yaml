initial_prompt: I need a histogram chart showing the distribution of housing prices
  in the New York housing market. The dataset has prices of properties, and I want
  to see how these prices are spread out. Please bin the prices in appropriate ranges
  like $0-$500k, $500k-$1M, etc., to visualize the number of properties in each price
  range. This will help understand the price distribution of real estate in New York,
  including affordable vs. luxury housing.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bins?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for easier interpretation of
  the data?

  3. How many bins would you prefer for the price ranges?

  4. Do you want labels on the bins to show the range of prices?

  5. Would you like to see the number or percentage of properties in each bin displayed?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences for the charts, especially for titles
  and labels?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Would you prefer the x-axis to be labeled with the exact dollar amounts or more
  general ranges (like "$0-$500k")?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or style?

  10. Should the chart legend be included, or is it unnecessary for this visualization?

  11. Do you have any preferences for the positioning or orientation of the x-axis
  labels (horizontal or tilted)?

  12. Would you like any additional annotations or markers (like highlighting specific
  price ranges) within the histogram?'
