initial_prompt: I want a line chart that visualizes the trend of housing prices over
  time in the New York Housing Market. Please use the 'PRICE' column for the y-axis
  and combine it with a time dimension based on the 'ADDRESS' or 'MAIN_ADDRESS' data
  to show how prices vary across different properties. Highlight different property
  types like 'Condo for sale' and 'House for sale' using different line colors. This
  chart should help analyze how property prices have changed in various locations
  within New York.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the time intervals on the x-axis (e.g.,
  yearly, quarterly, monthly)?

  2. How would you like to handle properties with incomplete or missing time data
  in the ''ADDRESS'' or ''MAIN_ADDRESS''?

  3. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the different property types
  (''Condo for sale'' and ''House for sale'')?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their style (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  5. Would you prefer to have data points marked on the lines, or just the lines themselves?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the legend to be positioned or formatted?

  7. Do you want the y-axis (''PRICE'') to be displayed with specific formatting,
  such as including dollar signs or commas for thousands?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to highlight specific
  data points or trends?

  9. Would you like to display a summary or aggregate data (like an average price
  line) on the chart?

  10. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for the labels and titles
  on the chart?'
