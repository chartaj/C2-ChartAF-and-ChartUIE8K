initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the New York Housing Market data. Plot
  property prices on the y-axis and property sizes in square feet on the x-axis. Differentiate
  types of properties (e.g., Condo for sale, House for sale) using different colors
  or markers. Make sure to label axes and include a legend. Show all data points from
  the 'PRICE' and 'PROPERTYSQFT' columns, without omitting any. This will help in
  understanding the relationship between property size and price across different
  property types in New York.
