initial_prompt: Create an area chart visualizing the New York Housing Market. Highlight
  price trends for different property types (condos, houses) over time. Annotate high-priced
  listings and unique properties like the "Central Park Tower Penthouse." Include
  property details such as beds, baths, square footage, and location. The chart should
  emphasize price variations across different neighborhoods and types to inform potential
  buyers and investors of market dynamics. Use color coding to differentiate property
  types and add data-driven text annotations for significant data points. This will
  help users quickly grasp key insights from the real estate data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for differentiating
  property types?

  2. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for easier comparison?

  3. Do you prefer specific shapes or icons for the data-driven text annotations on
  significant data points?

  4. Is there a particular layout or order in which you would like the property details
  (beds, baths, square footage, location) to be displayed?

  5. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the price trends on the y-axis?

  6. Is there a preference for the time intervals (daily, monthly, yearly) over which
  the price trends should be displayed on the x-axis?

  7. Are there any other high-priced or unique properties, besides the "Central Park
  Tower Penthouse," that you want to highlight specifically?'
