initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the state-wise scores of logistics parameters
  like Road Infrastructure, Rail Infrastructure, Warehousing, and Logistics Services.
  This will help compare the quality and performance across different states effectively.
  Use color gradients to represent varying scores.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing varying scores
  in the heatmap?

  2. How many color levels would you prefer in the gradient?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme (e.g., warm colors,
  cool colors, diverging colors)?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to display numerical values within each cell?

  5. How should states be ordered? Alphabetically, by score, or any other specific
  order?

  6. Do you prefer a specific aspect ratio or size for the heatmap?

  7. Would you like labels for both axes to include full forms or abbreviations of
  state names?

  8. Do you want the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color gradients?

  9. Should missing or null values be highlighted in any specific way on the heatmap?

  10. Do you prefer a grid or border between the cells of the heatmap for better readability?'
