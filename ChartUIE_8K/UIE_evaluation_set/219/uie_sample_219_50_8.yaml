initial_prompt: Create a radar chart visualizing the "Quality of Road Infrastructure,"
  "Quality of Rail Infrastructure," "Quality of Warehousing Infrastructure," and "Final
  Score" for different states from the logistics quality dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the radar chart?

  2. Would you prefer the state names to be displayed directly on the chart, or is
  a legend sufficient?

  3. Do you want the values on the radar chart to be displayed with grid lines?

  4. Is there a specific range for the axes that you would like to set, or should
  it automatically adjust based on the data values?

  5. Would you like the radar chart to include data labels showing the exact values
  for each attribute?

  6. Are there any particular states that you would like to highlight on the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a title and subtitle on the radar chart? If so, please
  provide the desired text.

  8. Should the chart include axis labels for the different infrastructure attributes?

  9. Do you prefer the data to be normalized or scaled in a specific way for the radar
  chart?

  10. Are there any specific design elements or styles you would like to implement
  in the radar chart?'
