initial_prompt: Let's create a grouped bar chart to visualize the logistics quality
  scores for different states. The chart should include parameters like road, rail,
  multi-modal, unimodal terminal infrastructure, and more. Annotate key highlights,
  such as the top-performing states for each parameter. Use text annotations to show
  specific scores for selected states (e.g., Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab). This will
  help us compare how each state ranks across various logistics parameters and understand
  areas needing improvement. Ensure to include the final score and ease of doing business
  ranks for comprehensive insights into logistics quality in India.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bar groups representing different
  states?

  2. Would you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the bars?

  3. Do you have specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like a legend to identify the different parameters?

  5. How would you like the states to be ordered in the chart (e.g., alphabetically,
  by final score)?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds or benchmarks you would like to include on
  the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific bar width or spacing between the groups of bars?

  8. How detailed should the annotations be (e.g., percentage values, specific metrics)?

  9. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  10. Would you like gridlines or any other background elements in the chart to enhance
  readability?'
