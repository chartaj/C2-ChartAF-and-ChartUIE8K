initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the logistics quality in
  Indian states. Use the "Final Score" as the y-axis and the "State wise scores of
  individual parameters" as the x-axis. Additionally, plot points using different
  colors to represent the "Quality of Road Infrastructure" for each state, and use
  the size of the points to represent the "Timeliness of Cargo Delivery (Transportation)"
  across states. This will help to compare overall logistics quality with road infrastructure
  quality and transportation timeliness for each state on a single chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  represent the ''Quality of Road Infrastructure''?

  2. Do you prefer any specific size scale for the points representing the ''Timeliness
  of Cargo Delivery (Transportation)''?

  3. How would you like the states to be labeled on the x-axis?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for axis titles, labels, and legends?

  6. Would you like to include a legend describing the color scale and size of the
  points?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the scatter plot?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or markers for specific states?

  9. Would you like to see the data points connected with lines to highlight trends,
  or should they remain as individual points?

  10. Is there a particular style or theme (e.g., minimalistic, professional, vibrant)
  that you prefer for the scatter plot?'
