initial_prompt: I need a circular treemap chart showcasing languages spoken in various
  countries. The inner circle should represent different countries, and around each
  country, smaller segments should illustrate the languages spoken. Ensure labels
  for both the country and languages are clear and readable. The details should be
  based on the variety and frequency of languages spoken as presented. Please make
  the chart visually appealing and easy to understand, emphasizing diversity in language
  distribution across the globe. Include a legend for clarity. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating countries
  and languages in the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the labels to ensure readability?

  3. Should the legend be placed in a particular location within the chart?

  4. Are there any specific countries or languages that you want to highlight or emphasize
  more?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title or any additional annotations?'
