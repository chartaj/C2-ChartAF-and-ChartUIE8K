initial_prompt: I have data on languages spoken across various countries and I'd like
  to visualize this with a Treemap. The data includes columns for 'Country' and 'Languages
  Spoken', covering around 198 unique countries and 191 unique languages. I want to
  see how different languages are distributed worldwide, highlighting both the diversity
  and commonality among nations. Ensure the Treemap displays countries as segments
  and includes labels for the predominant languages spoken. This way, I can easily
  identify which languages are most widespread and which countries share the same
  languages. Please make it visually intuitive and informative. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Treemap?

  2. Would you like any specific countries or languages to be highlighted more prominently?

  3. Should we use different shades or patterns to distinguish between regions or
  continents?

  4. How would you like the predominant languages to be labeled (e.g., full names,
  abbreviations, or codes)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for labels and text within the
  Treemap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding or any other visual
  elements?

  7. Are there any specific data points or categories you would like to exclude or
  include?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout for the Treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice,
  or strip)?'
