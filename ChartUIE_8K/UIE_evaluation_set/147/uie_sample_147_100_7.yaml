initial_prompt: Please generate a bar chart that showcases the number of unique languages
  spoken in each country listed in the dataset. Ensure each bar represents a different
  country with the corresponding count of languages spoken in that country. The x-axis
  should denote the countries, and the y-axis should indicate the number of unique
  languages spoken. This will help in visualizing the linguistic diversity across
  various nations as provided in the data format. Thank you!
