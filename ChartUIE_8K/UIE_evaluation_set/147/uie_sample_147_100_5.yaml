initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the most common languages spoken
  across different countries. Use the provided dataset to highlight linguistic diversity.
  Each country should be color-coded based on the number of languages spoken, with
  a gradient representing the range from fewer to more languages. The map should include
  a legend explaining the color gradient and be interactive, allowing users to hover
  over each country to see a tooltip with detailed information on the specific languages
  spoken. This will provide an insightful view into global language distribution patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for the countries
  based on the number of languages spoken?

  2. Do you prefer any particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, Albers)?

  3. How detailed should the legend be? Should it include specific ranges of languages?

  4. Is there a specific geographic region or countries you want to focus more on
  or highlight?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotation or labels on the map besides
  the country names?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the text elements
  on the map?'
