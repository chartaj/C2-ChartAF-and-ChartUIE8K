initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Create a heatmap visualizing the number of unique languages spoken across different
  countries. Highlight countries with the highest linguistic diversity. Annotate key
  data points like Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria, focusing on the different official
  and minority languages spoken. The heatmap should help in understanding the distribution
  and concentration of languages globally, serving both educational and analytical
  purposes in the field of literature and linguistics.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap emphasize any particular ranges of language diversity more
  than others?

  3. How would you like the map to be annotated for highlighting Afghanistan, Albania,
  and Algeria (e.g., specific symbols, font size)?

  4. Do you have a preferred method for categorizing countries by linguistic diversity
  (e.g., based on a threshold or percentile)?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to display exact numbers of languages spoken in each
  country, or just relative intensity?

  6. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for displaying global data?

  7. Do you want a legend to explain the color scale used in the heatmap, and if so,
  where should it be positioned?

  8. How detailed should the annotations be for the official and minority languages
  of the highlighted countries?

  9. Should the heatmap include any hover-over tooltips or labels to provide additional
  information about each countryâ€™s linguistic diversity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Specific symbols and a larger font size would be good for highlighting Afghanistan,
  Albania, and Algeria.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I would prefer relative intensity rather than exact numbers.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color scale, ideally positioned at
  the bottom right of the heatmap.

  8. The annotations should be moderately detailed, mentioning both official and a
  few key minority languages.

  9. I am not sure.'
