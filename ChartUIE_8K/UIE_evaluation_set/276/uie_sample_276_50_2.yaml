initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare wheat grain length, width, area,
  and weight across different genotypes, fields, and blocks. Highlight differences
  in weight and annotate maximum and minimum values for significance.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for highlighting differences in weight?

  2. Do you have specific colors you would like to use for the different genotypes,
  fields, and blocks?

  3. Would you prefer to have the annotations for maximum and minimum values displayed
  on the bars themselves or near them?

  4. How would you like the chart to handle overlapping labels, if applicable?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the annotations and labels?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart? If so, do you prefer them
  to be solid or dashed?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Would you prefer the legend to be placed at a specific position (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the sorting order of the genotypes, fields,
  and blocks?'
