initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the area and weight of Triticum
  aestivum across different fields and genotypes. Each group should represent a field,
  and within each group, bars should show the area and weight for each genotype. Add
  text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest values within each field. The
  purpose of this visualization is to understand how different genotypes perform in
  different fields in terms of area and weight, aiding agricultural planning and analysis.
  Use color highlights to differentiate between genotypes for easier comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different genotypes?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or legends for the fields and genotypes?

  3. Do you have a preferred font type and size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the annotations for the highest and lowest values include specific details
  like values or just highlighting the bar?

  5. Is there a preferred orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?

  7. Should the bars be displayed with any particular spacing or grouping style?

  8. Are there any specific axis titles or labels you would like to use?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart title?

  10. Would you like to include any additional data points or information within the
  bars (e.g., exact numerical values)?'
