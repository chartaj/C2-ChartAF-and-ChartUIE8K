initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the wheat grain data. I want
  to see how the Area and Weight of Triticum aestivum grains vary across different
  Lengths and Widths. Use Length and Width on the X-axis and plot two lines, one for
  Area and one for Weight. The dataset includes columns like Length, Width, Area,
  Weight, which you will need to plot this line chart. Make sure the chart clearly
  shows trends and allows comparison between Area and Weight. The data appears to
  be complete with few missing values. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color of the lines representing ''Area''
  and ''Weight''?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed)?

  4. Should the chart include data markers on the lines to highlight individual data
  points?

  5. Do you want a legend to differentiate between the ''Area'' and ''Weight'' lines?

  6. Would you like axis titles to be included, and if so, do you have specific labels
  in mind?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  8. Should the chart include annotations or notes for any specific data points or
  trends?

  9. Is there a preferred scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for the Y-axis?

  10. Do you need any specific text or captions to be included in the chart?'
