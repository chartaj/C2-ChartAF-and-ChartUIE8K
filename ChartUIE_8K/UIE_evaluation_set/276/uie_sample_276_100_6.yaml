initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize wheat grain area and weight data. X-axis
  should represent Length, and the Y-axis should represent Weight. Each dot should
  be colored according to the Field and shaped based on the Genotype. Also, include
  a legend to differentiate Field and Genotype easily. This will help in analyzing
  variations in length and weight across different fields and genotypes. Additionally,
  ensure the data points for Length and Weight are clearly marked for easier comparison.
  Please provide an insight into any notable patterns you observe. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the dots representing
  different Fields?

  2. What shapes would you prefer for the dots representing different Genotypes?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the legend and axis labels?

  5. Do you want any particular axis scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic) for the X-axis
  or Y-axis?

  6. Is there a preferred order for the Fields and Genotypes in the legend?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or markers you want to highlight certain data
  points?

  8. Do you prefer a specific orientation or format for the legend (e.g., side or
  bottom, horizontal or vertical)?

  9. Would you like to include titles and subtitles for the chart, and if so, what
  should they be?'

  9. Yes, please include a title "Wheat Grain Length vs. Weight" and a subtitle "Colored
  by Field and Shaped by Genotype".'
