initial_prompt: I have a dataset on wheat grain from different fields detailing types,
  genotypes, blocks, and measurements like length, width, area, and weight. I need
  a bubble chart to visualize this data. Each bubble should represent an individual
  wheat grain, with the x-axis showing the grain length and the y-axis showing the
  grain width. The bubble size should indicate the grain area, and the color should
  represent different genotypes. Ensure to exclude any missing or NA values from the
  chart. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to represent
  different genotypes?

  2. Would you like any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you prefer any specific ranges or scales for the length and width axes (e.g.,
  linear or logarithmic)?

  4. Should the bubble size be proportional to the area in a specific manner, or is
  the default scaling acceptable?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines or background elements in the chart?

  6. Is there any particular style or theme (e.g., minimalist, detailed) you would
  like for the overall appearance of the chart?

  7. Do you need a legend or any additional annotations to help explain the chart?

  8. Are there any specific data points or outliers that you want highlighted in the
  bubble chart?

  9. Should the chart include axis labels, titles, or additional explanatory text
  to aid understanding?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you would prefer for the
  bubble chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Grain Length" and the y-axis should be labeled
  "Grain Width".

  3. I do not know.

  4. The default scaling is acceptable.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a legend to explain the colors representing different genotypes would be
  helpful.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, including axis labels and a title would be helpful. The title can be "Wheat
  Grain Measurements".

  10. I do not know.'
