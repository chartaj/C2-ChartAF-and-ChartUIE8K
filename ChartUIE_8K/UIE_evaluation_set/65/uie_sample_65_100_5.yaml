initial_prompt: 'Please create a histogram to visualize the impact of product positioning
  on sales. Use the "Product Position" column as the categories for the histogram
  and the "Sales Volume" column as the numerical values to be plotted. Show how different
  product positions (Aisle, End-cap, etc.) affect sales volume. This will help in
  understanding which product positions result in higher sales. Include clear labels
  for the axes: "Product Position" on the x-axis and "Sales Volume" on the y-axis.
  This will assist in our business analysis for better product placement strategies.'
