initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to explore the impact of product positioning on sales
  volume. Highlight trends across different product categories and positions. Use
  textual annotations to indicate significant price differences and demographic targets.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?\n2. Should the\

  \ you prefer any specific ordering for the product positions or categories on the\
  \ axes?\n4. Do you have a preference for the positioning and format of the textual\
  \ annotations?\n5. Should high sales volumes be represented with warm colors (e.g.,\
  \ red, yellow) or cool colors (e.g., blue, green)?\n6. Are there any specific fonts\
  \ or styles you would like for the textual annotations and labels?\n7. Would you\
  \ like to include gridlines or borders around the cells in the heatmap?\n8. How\
  \ detailed should the price differences and demographic targets be annotated? \n\
  9. Should there be a legend included for the heatmap, and if so, any specific preferences\
  \ for its placement?"
