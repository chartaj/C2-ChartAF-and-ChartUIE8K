initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the impact of product positioning
  on sales volume. Utilize the summary data provided and categorize sales volume based
  on product position (Aisle, End-cap), and include foot traffic levels (Low, Medium,
  High). Make sure to show average sales volume for each category, and differentiate
  between products on promotion and those not on promotion. Highlight the relationship
  between product positioning and sales across different product categories and seasonal/non-seasonal
