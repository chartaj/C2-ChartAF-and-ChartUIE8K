initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the impact of product positioning
  on sales volume. Use "Product Position" on the x-axis and "Sales Volume" on the
  y-axis. Differentiate the lines based on "Product Category," and include markers
  for each "Product Position" category. Also, add a trend line for "Price" and "Competitor's
  Price" to see how they correlate with sales volume. Highlight points where promotions
  were applied and account for "Seasonal" attributes to investigate any fluctuation
  patterns over time. Ensure the chart is clear and has distinct colors for each line
  and marker.

  lines and markers?

  2. Would you like the markers for each product position category to have a specific
