initial_prompt: Use a scatter plot to display the impact of product positioning on
  sales. Use 'Product Position' and 'Product Category' as axes, with 'Sales Volume'
  determining the size of the points. Annotate points of high sales volumes to emphasize
  key data. Highlight the points for different promotions to easily compare their

  areas to guide strategic decisions.
