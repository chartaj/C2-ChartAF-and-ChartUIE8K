initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the impact of different product
  positions on sales volume over time. Highlight the variations in sales volumes for
  products placed in aisles, end-caps, and other positions relative to price and promotions.
  Use "Sales Volume" on the y-axis and "Foot Traffic" alongside "Product Position"
  on the x-axis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  product positions (aisles, end-caps, and others)?

  2. Would you like to use distinct line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for each product
  position category?

  3. Should price and promotion data be included as annotations or in a tooltip when
  hovering over data points?

  4. Do you want to display foot traffic as a secondary y-axis or incorporate it into
  the primary x-axis?

  5. Would you prefer the x-axis to be labeled by time intervals (e.g., days, weeks,
  months, quarters)?

  6. Are there specific fonts or styles you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should we include grid lines for easier interpretation of the data?

  8. Do you want a legend to distinguish between different product positions and other
  variables?

  9. Do you prefer any specific data point markers (circles, squares, triangles) for
  representing different product positions?

  10. Are there any specific thresholds or markers (e.g., average sales volume) you
  want to highlight on the chart?'
