initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the impact of product positioning
  on sales. Use 'Product Position' on the x-axis and 'Sales Volume' on the y-axis.
  Include annotations to highlight key data points, such as products on 'End-cap'
  positions and their sales volumes. Differentiate columns by color based on 'Promotion'
  and 'Seasonal' attributes to provide additional context. Annotate the highest and
  lowest sales volumes to draw attention to significant differences. This will help
  understand how positioning, promotions, and seasonality affect sales, aiding in
  strategic business decisions.
