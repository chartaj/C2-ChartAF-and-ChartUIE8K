initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the real estate data. The x-axis
  should represent the "X1 transaction date" to show different years, while the y-axis
  should display the "Y house price of unit area." Use different colors to represent
  the "X4 number of convenience stores" adjacent to each property. The chart should
  help us analyze how transaction date and the number of convenience stores correlate
  with the house price per unit area. Summarize patterns and trends for better insights
  into the real estate market over time.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for differentiating the "X4
  number of convenience stores"?

  2. How would you like to handle the grouping of the "X1 transaction date" on the
  x-axis (e.g., by year, month, or exact date)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the scale on the y-axis for "Y house price of unit
  area" (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  4. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed as grouped or stacked based on the
  "X4 number of convenience stores"?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the bars to be sorted in, such as by
  date or house price?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines for better readability of the data points on
  the chart?

  7. Should we include data labels on each bar to show exact values of the "Y house
  price of unit area"?

  8. Would you like any trend lines overlayed on the chart to show patterns over time?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the titles, axis labels,
  and data labels?'
