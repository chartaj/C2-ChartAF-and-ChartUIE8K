initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of house prices per
  unit area ("Y house price of unit area"). Use the data in the file ../Extra_datas/data/204.csv
  for the box chart. Make sure to include outliers, median, and quartiles in the chart.
  Label the x-axis as "House Price Distribution" and the y-axis as "Price per Unit
  Area". This will help in understanding the spread and central tendency of house
  prices in the dataset for real estate price prediction purposes.

  7. Do you want grid lines in the chart, and if so, in which format (both axes, horizontal

  8. Would you like to include any background elements, such as shading or patterns,
  to differentiate sections of the chart?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart?

  10. Do you plan to present this chart in a particular medium (e.g., slide presentation,
  printed report), and if so, are there any formatting requirements to consider?'
