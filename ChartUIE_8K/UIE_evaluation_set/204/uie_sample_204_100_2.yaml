initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the trends in house prices over time.
  Use the 'X1 transaction date' on the x-axis and 'Y house price of unit area' on
  the y-axis. Highlight data points with text annotations that display values linked
  to each point to draw attention to specific price changes. Additionally, use different
  colors to emphasize significant trends or anomalies. The chart should help in understanding
  how house prices vary with factors like house age, distance to MRT station, number
  of convenience stores, and geographical location. Ensure clarity and focus on significant
  insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for this chart?

  2. How would you like significant trends or anomalies to be highlighted (specific
  colors, shapes, etc.)?

  3. Do you prefer the text annotations to appear on hover or be permanently visible
  on the chart?

  4. Are there specific time intervals you are interested in highlighting (e.g., yearly,
  quarterly, monthly)?

  5. Would you like trend lines or moving averages to be included in the chart?

  6. Should there be separate trend lines or markers for different regions based on
  geographical location data?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  8. Are there any particular thresholds or benchmarks that should be used to identify
  significant trends or anomalies?

  9. Would you like to include a legend explaining the different colors and markers
  used on the chart?

  10. Is there any other specific information or annotations you would like to see
  on the chart?'
