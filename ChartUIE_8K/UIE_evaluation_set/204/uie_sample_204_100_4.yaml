initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between the
  various features in the real estate dataset. Specifically, I am interested in seeing
  how the house price per unit area correlates with transaction date, house age, distance
  to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude.
  Make sure to use color gradients that clearly distinguish the strength of these
  correlations. Plot the correlation matrix and highlight significant relationships,
  especially focusing on house price per unit area. This will help us understand which
  factors most influence property prices. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradient preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to set specific criteria for highlighting significant relationships
  in the correlation matrix?

  3. Do you prefer any particular size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like included in the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the display of the correlation values (e.g.,
  showing values within the cells)?

  6. Are there any additional visual elements or styles you would like to include
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to focus on a specific color scheme (e.g., cool tones,
  warm tones)?'
