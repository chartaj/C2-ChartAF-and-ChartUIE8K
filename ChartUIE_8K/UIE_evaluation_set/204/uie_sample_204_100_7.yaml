initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map of the real estate data to visualize the house
  prices per unit area geographically. Use 'X5 latitude' and 'X6 longitude' for determining
  the locations and 'Y house price of unit area' for the color gradient. Ensure the
  map clearly differentiates between varying price levels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or a predefined color palette
  for the choropleth map?

  2. Are there any particular ranges or thresholds of house prices that you would
  like to highlight with distinct colors?

  3. What specific geographic boundaries or regions should the map cover (e.g., specific
  cities, states, countries)?

  4. Should the map include geographic labels for regions, such as city or district
  names?

  5. Do you prefer a specific projection type for the map (e.g., Mercator, Albers,
  etc.)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradient? If so, any
  preferences on its placement?

  7. Do you want to add any additional data layers (e.g., locations of MRT stations
  or convenience stores)?'
