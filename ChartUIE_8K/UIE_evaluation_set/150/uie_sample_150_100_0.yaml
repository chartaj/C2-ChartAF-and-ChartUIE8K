initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the student performance data. Highlight
  key metrics like G1, G2, and G3 scores by adjusting their dot size or color to emphasize
  variations. Add text annotations for outliers in the 'absences' and 'health' columns,
  providing additional context. Make sure to highlight the 'studytime' and 'failures'
  columns, as these are crucial in understanding academic performance trends. This
  visualization will help in identifying patterns and drawing insights into factors
  affecting student grades and overall health. Aim to keep the chart clear and informative
  for educational analysis purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the dot plot?

  2. How would you like the dots to be sized to highlight G1, G2, and G3 scores?

  3. What specific colors would you like to use to differentiate between G1, G2, and
  G3 scores?

  4. Are there any specific formats or styles for the text annotations for outliers
  that you prefer?

  5. How would you like to highlight the ''studytime'' and ''failures'' columns in
  terms of dot size, shape, or color?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should there be a legend to explain the color and size variations of the dots?
  If so, do you have any specific preferences for it?

  8. Do you prefer any specific markers for outliers in the ''absences'' and ''health''
  columns?

  9. Is there a specific layout or chart structure that you prefer to ensure clarity
  and informativeness?

  10. Are there any additional metrics or data points from the dataset that you would
  like to include in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the dots to be sized proportionally to emphasize variations in G1,
  G2, and G3 scores.

  3. I do not have specific colors in mind.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Perhaps use different shapes or colors to distinguish studytime and failures;
  I am not sure.

  6. I do not have any specific preferences.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful, but I do not have specific preferences for its
  design.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have any specific layout preferences.

  10. I am not sure.'
