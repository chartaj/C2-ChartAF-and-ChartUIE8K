initial_prompt: '<start of the annotation list>

  Create a line chart displaying students'' G1, G2, and G3 grades over time.

  Highlight students with consistently high grades.

  Add text annotations for students with significant grade changes.

  Ensure the x-axis represents school terms (G1, G2, G3), and the y-axis indicates
  grade values.

  This should help in identifying performance trends.
