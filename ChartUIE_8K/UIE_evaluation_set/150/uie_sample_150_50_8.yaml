initial_prompt: Create a histogram showcasing the distribution of 'G3' final grades
  from the student performance dataset. This will help visualize how students' final
  grades are distributed across different value ranges. Make sure to label the x-axis
  as 'Final Grades (G3)' and the y-axis as 'Frequency of Students.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have a specific bin width in mind for the grades?

  3. Would you like the histogram to display absolute frequencies or relative frequencies
  (percentages)?

  4. Should the histogram include a summary statistic, such as mean or median, overlaid
  on the graph?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be displayed in the background for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the labels and title?

  7. Would you prefer the histogram to have a border around the bars?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or text on the histogram, such as highlighting
  a specific range of grades?'
