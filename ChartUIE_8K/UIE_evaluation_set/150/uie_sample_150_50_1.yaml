initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between students' final grades
  (G3) and various features like studytime, absences, and parental education. Use
  annotations to highlight significant correlations. This will help identify the most
  influential factors on student performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the heatmap?

  2. What specific threshold would you consider for highlighting significant correlations?

  3. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  4. How detailed would you like the annotations to be (e.g., show correlation values,
  statistical significance)?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the annotations (e.g., font
  size, style)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color coding of correlation
  values?

  7. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap to fit into your
  presentation or report?'
