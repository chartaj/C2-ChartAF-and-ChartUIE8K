initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize student performance data, focusing on
  grades (G1, G2, G3) and their correlation with other factors like study time, family
  support, and internet access. The heatmap should highlight key correlations using
  color gradients, e.g., darker colors for stronger correlations. Include annotations
  to draw attention to significant relationships, such as the impact of study time
  on final grades, or the role of internet access in academic performance. Use the
  data details to infer practical insights, like how educational support features
  may influence outcomes. Keep the visualization clear and user-friendly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific labels or text annotations for significant correlations?

  3. Should annotations include numerical correlation values?

  4. Do you have a preferred method for indicating significance thresholds, such as
  p-values?

  5. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., abbreviated vs full names)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient?

  7. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the heatmap?

  8. What is your preference regarding the orientation of the heatmap (horizontal
  or vertical)?

  9. Are there any specific layout considerations or dimensions you have in mind for
  the heatmap?

  10. Are there any other contextual factors or variables you would like to include
  or highlight in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like specific labels or text annotations for significant correlations.

  3. Yes, annotations should include numerical correlation values.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Abbreviated names are fine.

  6. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend explaining the color gradient.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No, the factors mentioned are sufficient.'
