initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that visualizes the student performance data. Specifically,
  I'd like to see the relationship between students' study time and their final grades
  (G3). Separate the data by school. Use different colors for each school to compare
  them easily. Make sure the x-axis represents the study time (with unique values
  like 1, 2, 3, 4) and the y-axis represents the average final grade (G3). Title the
  chart "Impact of Study Time on Final Grades by School". This will help in understanding
  how study habits affect performance in different schools.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette for each school?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the chart title and axis labels?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart?

  5. Would you like to add data labels on the bars to show the exact average final
  grades (G3)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the chart''s background color or gridlines?

  7. Should we include any specific axis titles apart from the standard ones (''Study
  Time'' for x-axis and ''Average Final Grade'' for y-axis)?

  8. Are there any specific margins or padding requirements for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Vertically.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please add data labels on the bars.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. No, the standard axis titles are fine.

  8. I do not know.'
