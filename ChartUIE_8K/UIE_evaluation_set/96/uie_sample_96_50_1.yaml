initial_prompt: Create a box plot visualizing the distribution of body_mass_g across
  different species of penguins. Highlight any species with significant outliers.
  Add text annotations for the mean body mass of each species.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different species in
  the box plot?

  2. How would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different color, shape)?

  3. Do you want the mean body mass annotations to be displayed inside or outside
  the box plot?

  4. What font size and style would you like for the text annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, what should they be?

  6. Do you want grid lines in the background of the chart? If yes, should they be
  in both directions (horizontal and vertical)?

  7. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include in the box
  plot?

  8. Would you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plot?

  9. Do you have any preference for the size (width and height) of the final chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different color.

  3. Inside the box plot.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, a title and axis labels would be good. Title: "Distribution of Body Mass
  Across Penguin Species", X-axis: "Species", Y-axis: "Body Mass (g)".

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Vertical orientation.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
