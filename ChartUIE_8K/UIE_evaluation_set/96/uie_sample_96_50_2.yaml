initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot of the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing on
  bill length vs. bill depth. Highlight annotations for missing values. Emphasize
  different species using colors and distinguish males and females with different
  shapes. Add labels for island and years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different species?

  2. What shapes would you prefer to use for distinguishing males and females?

  3. Do you have a specific size preference for the data points?

  4. How would you like the annotations for missing values to be displayed (e.g.,
  specific symbols, color, or text)?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  6. Where would you prefer the legend to be placed?

  7. Do you have a specific font style or size for the labels of islands and years?

  8. Should the chart have a title, and if so, what should it be?

  9. Would you like axis labels and if so, what text would you prefer for them?

  10. Do you want the axes to be scaled in any particular way (e.g., logarithmic,
  linear)?'

  8. Yes, the title should be \"Bill Length vs. Bill Depth by Species and Sex in Palmer\
  \ Penguins\".\n9. Yes, \"Bill Length (mm)\" for the x-axis and \"Bill Depth (mm)\"\
  \ for the y-axis.\n10. Linear scaling is preferred."
