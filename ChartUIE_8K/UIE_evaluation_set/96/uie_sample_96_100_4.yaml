initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the Palmer Penguins dataset. Use species
  as the parent category, and island as a subcategory. Size each rectangle by body_mass_g
  and color them by sex to show the distribution of penguin mass and sex within each
  species and island. Make sure to account for the missing values in body_mass_g and
  sex columns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or palette for different
  sexes?

  2. How would you like missing values to be represented or handled in the visualization?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout style for the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-and-dice)?

  4. Would you like labels to be displayed within the rectangles, and if so, what
  information should be included (e.g., species name, island name, body mass)?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels?

  6. Would you like a legend included in the visualization, and where would you prefer
  its placement (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Are there any specific tooltips or hover-over information you''d like to display
  when a user mouseovers a rectangle?

  8. Do you have any size preferences for the overall treemap or its individual elements?'
