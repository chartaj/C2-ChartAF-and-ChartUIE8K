initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing employment growth trends using
  LinkedIn data for various industries. Plot the ISIC section, ISIC section name,
  industry_sk, and industry name. Highlight different industrial groups and divisions
  with distinct colors. Add text annotations to emphasize key data points and trends,
  especially where notable increases or dips in employment growth occur. The purpose

  occurring. Use highlights to draw attention to the most significant changes.
