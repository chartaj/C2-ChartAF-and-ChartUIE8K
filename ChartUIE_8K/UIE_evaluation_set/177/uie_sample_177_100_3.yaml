initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map showcasing the geographical distribution
  of company growth as inferred from financial news sentiment analysis. The map should
  highlight different regions based on the sentiment (neutral, negative, positive)
  of the mentioned news articles related to business. Use varying shades or colors
  to represent the sentiment intensity and ensure each region's shade accurately reflects
  the sentiment data. The map should be interactive, allowing users to hover or click
  on a region to view specific details about the sentiments and associated news headlines.
  This will help identify regional performance trends visually. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for each sentiment category (neutral,
  negative, positive)?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding and intensity
  levels?

  3. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Albers)?

  4. Should the map display political boundaries, major cities, or any other geographical
  features?

  5. Would you like to display data labels or tooltips that show the exact sentiment
  score when hovering over a region?

  6. Do you want regions with no data to be represented in a specific color or remain
  blank?

  7. Is there a preferred font style and size for any text on the map (e.g., region
  names, data labels)?

  8. Should the map include a title and description, and if so, what should they be?

  9. Do you want to include a zoom and pan feature for easier navigation through different
  regions?'
