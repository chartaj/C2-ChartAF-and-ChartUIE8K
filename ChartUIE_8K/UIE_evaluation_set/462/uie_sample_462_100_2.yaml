initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the global mobile phone sales
  by vendor. The vendors are Samsung, Nokia/Microsoft, Apple, LG, ZTE, and Huawei,
  with data spanning multiple quarters. Highlight the median sales values and annotate
  significant outliers for each vendor. This helps in understanding sales performance
  variances across vendors and time. Use different colors to distinguish each vendor,
  making it easy to compare their performance. The purpose is to identify trends and
  outliers in vendor sales, assisting business decisions based on market performance
  insights. Keep annotations clear to focus on standout data points.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for each vendor?

  2. Would you like to specify any particular style for highlighting median sales
  values?

  3. Is there a preferred method for annotating significant outliers (e.g., specific
  symbols, text labels)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the scale or range of the Y-axis?

  5. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend and, if so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the box chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal)?

  8. Should we include grid lines or background shading to help differentiate between
  quarters or vendors?

  9. Is there a specific format for the quarter labels you would like to use (e.g.,
  Q1 ''10, Q2 ''10)?'
