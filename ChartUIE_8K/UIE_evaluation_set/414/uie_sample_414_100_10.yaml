initial_prompt: I want to visualize the change in cropland area over time for different
  continents. Use the 'Year' as the timeline and 'Cropland (HYDE (2017))' as the variable
  you are plotting. Make a Choropleth map that shows the geographical distribution
  across continents. Highlight significant periods where changes are most noticeable.
  Add interactive elements to explore data values for each continent in different
  years. Include a color gradient to represent varying cropland areas, and a legend
  to explain the color codes. Ensure the map is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the gradient representing
  cropland areas?

  2. Do you want to include any specific annotations or markers on the significant
  periods where changes are most noticeable?

  3. How detailed should the legend be, and do you want any additional information
  included in the legend?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the style or appearance of the Choropleth
  map (e.g., border colors, map projection)?

  5. Would you like to include any additional geographical information or boundaries
  on the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences for the gradient.

  2. I do not know if I want specific annotations or markers on significant periods.

  3. I have no specific preference for the detail level of the legend, just make it
  clear and easy to understand.

  4. I am not sure about the style or appearance preferences for the choropleth map.

  5. I do not have a preference for additional geographical information or boundaries
  on the map.'
