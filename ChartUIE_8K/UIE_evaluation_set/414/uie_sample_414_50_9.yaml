  \ or marker type?\n4. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for each continent's\
  \ data points?\n5. Is there a preferred title for the scatter plot?\n6. Are there\
  \ any specific axis label formats you prefer for the X-axis (years) and Y-axis (cropland\
  \ area)?\n7. Would you like to include axis titles and, if so, what should they\
  \ be?\n8. Do you want to add reference lines or trend lines to emphasize trends\
  \ over time?\n9. How detailed should the tick marks be on the X and Y axes? \n10.\
