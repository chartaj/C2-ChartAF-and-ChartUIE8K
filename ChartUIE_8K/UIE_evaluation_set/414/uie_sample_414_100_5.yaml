initial_prompt: I have this dataset `414.csv` about cropland in different continents
  spanning several years. I need a bar chart to visualize the historical trends of
  cropland areas for each continent. Ensure the x-axis represents the years and the
  y-axis shows the cropland area (HYDE 2017). Each bar should be color-coded by continent.
  I'll use this chart to analyze and compare how cropland usage has evolved over time
  across different continents. Missing values in the 'Code' column can be ignored
  for this visualization. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the continents?

  2. How detailed should the year intervals be on the x-axis (e.g., yearly, every
  5 years, every 10 years)?

  3. Do you have a specific title or label for the chart?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Should there be specific markers or annotations for significant years or events?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. Do you need data labels on the bars to display the exact cropland area values?

  9. Would you like to apply any specific data smoothing or aggregation methods for
  the yearly data?

  10. Should the chart include any reference lines (e.g., average cropland area) for
  context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Every 5 years would be fine.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, grid lines would be great for readability.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. No, data labels on the bars are not necessary.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No, reference lines are not needed.'
