initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing cropland data for different continents
  over time from -10000 to modern years. Highlight significant periods and annotate
  key data points to emphasize trends in agricultural development. This will provide
  insights into historical and geographical cropland changes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color gradient be sequential, diverging, or categorical?

  3. Do you want specific annotations for certain key years or periods?

  4. How should significant periods be highlighted? Would you like bold borders, different
  colors, or another method?

  5. Would you like a timeline axis to be segmented by specific intervals (e.g., centuries,
  millennia)?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to include gridlines for better readability of data
  points?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color scale for cropland data?

  8. Would you like to include labels or annotations for the continents?

  9. Would you like to include trend lines to show overall trends in agricultural
  development over time?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include specific annotations for key years or periods.

  4. Bold borders would be good for highlighting significant periods.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color scale for cropland data.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Yes, please include trend lines to show overall trends in agricultural development
