initial_prompt: I need an area chart that visualizes the changes in cropland over
  time for different continents. Use the data provided, focusing on the 'Year' and
  'Cropland (HYDE (2017))' columns for each entity. Make sure to handle missing values
  appropriately, especially for the 'Code' column. Highlight trends and differences
  between continents clearly. This visualization will help understand historical agricultural
  land use patterns across various regions. Ensure the x-axis represents the years
  and the y-axis shows the cropland area. Add legends and labels for clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different continents?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and legends?

  4. Should we display data points or markers on the area chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the order in which continents should be displayed
  in the legend?

  6. Should the chart include annotations or highlight specific historical events
  related to agricultural land use?

  7. Do you prefer a specific range for the y-axis or should it be automatically scaled
  based on the data?

  8. Would you like multiple y-axes if other variables need to be represented?

  9. Are there any specific years or time ranges you want to emphasize or zoom in
  on?

  10. Should the x-axis be in a linear scale or a logarithmic scale given the long
  historical timeframe?'
