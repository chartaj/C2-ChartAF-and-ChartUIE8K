initial_prompt: Please create a column chart to visualize the cropland data for each
  continent over time, using the data provided. The chart should display how cropland
  areas have changed from -10000 to recent years. Make sure to separate the data by
  continent for clarity. Use different colors for each continent so that trends are
  easy to distinguish. Include a legend, as well as labels for the x-axis (Year) and
  y-axis (Cropland Area). Also, ensure that the chart is easy to interpret and visually
  appealing. Thank you!
