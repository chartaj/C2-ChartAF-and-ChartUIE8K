initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of Effective
  Minimum Wages in 2020 dollars across all states from 1968 to 2020. Use text annotations
  to highlight notable years or states where the Effective Minimum Wage significantly
  deviates from the federal minimum wage. Ensure the chart contextually emphasizes
  economic trends over time and provides a clear understanding of minimum wage variance
  among states. Add relevant non-data-driven annotations for context and editorial
  comments to guide viewers. Make the histogram visually engaging with highlights
  to distinguish significant data points. Title the chart "US Minimum Wage by State
  (1968-2020)".
