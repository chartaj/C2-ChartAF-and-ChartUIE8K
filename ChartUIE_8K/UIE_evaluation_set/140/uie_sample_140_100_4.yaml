initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the Effective Minimum Wage (in 2020 Dollars)
  for Alabama, Alaska, and Arizona in 1968. Use the column "Effective.Minimum.Wage.2020.Dollars"
  for the wage values and "State" for the state names. Title the chart "Effective
  Minimum Wage Comparison (2020 Dollars) among States in 1968". Ensure the Y-axis
  represents the wage amounts in 2020 Dollars, and the X-axis has the states. Include
  data labels showing the exact wage amounts on each bar for clarity. This chart will
  help visualize the differences in minimum wages across these states during that
  year.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars representing each state?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for chart titles and labels?

  3. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be both horizontal
  and vertical or just one type?

  5. What style of data labels do you prefer (e.g., bold, italic, specific font size)?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  7. Should the Y-axis start at zero, or do you prefer a different starting point
  for better comparison?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the width of the bars?

  9. Would you like a specific background color or pattern for the chart?

  10. Do you want a legend included, or is it unnecessary given the simplicity of
  the chart?

  11. Is there a specific format for the Y-axis values (e.g., with dollar signs, two
  decimal places)?
