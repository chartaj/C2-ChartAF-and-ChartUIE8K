initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize state minimum wage trends from 1968
  to 2020. Highlight key years and annotate significant changes. Use colors to differentiate
  decades and include federal vs. state comparisons. Aim to showcase how wages have
  evolved against inflation.

  the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific years in mind that you would like us to highlight in
  the visualization?

  focus on all states uniformly?

  4. Do you have a preferred style for annotating significant changes, such as arrows,
  text boxes, or highlights?

  5. How detailed do you want the annotations to be regarding significant changes?

  6. Would you like the federal minimum wage data to be presented as a separate series
  or overlaid on the state data?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Should the inflation adjustment be a prominent part of the visualization, or
  just mentioned in annotations?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the chart text?

  10. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding and annotations
  used in the chart?
