initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the U.S. minimum wage by state
  from 1968 to 2020. The map should use color gradients to represent the "Effective.Minimum.Wage.2020.Dollars"
  for each state in each year. Add text annotations to highlight significant changes
  and outliers. Ensure the map includes a legend and tooltips for detailed information.
  Utilize highlights to distinguish states with the highest and lowest minimum wages.
  The purpose of this visualization is to analyze economic trends and compare state
  policies on minimum wage over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing the "Effective.Minimum.Wage.2020.Dollars"
  values on the choropleth map?

  2. How would you like significant changes and outliers to be annotated on the map
  (e.g., text boxes, arrows)?

  3. Do you have specific text you want included in the annotations for significant
  changes and outliers?

  4. Is there a preference for the placement of the legend on the map (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  5. Are there specific threshold values or ranges you want to use to highlight states
  with the highest and lowest minimum wages?

  6. Do you have a preferred style or format for the tooltips that display detailed
  information?

  7. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or visual elements
  on the map?'
