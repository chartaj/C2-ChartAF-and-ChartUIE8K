initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the US Minimum Wage by State from
  1968 to 2020. Use different colors to represent each state. The x-axis should display
  the years from 1968 to 2020, and the y-axis should show the minimum wage in 2020
  dollars. Please include both the State Minimum Wage and the Federal Minimum Wage
  as lines within the chart for comparison. Highlight key states and label significant
  changes in minimum wage values. This chart will help us understand trends and variations
  in minimum wages over time across different states.
