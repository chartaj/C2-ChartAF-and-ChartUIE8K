initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the evolution of 'total' stats over generations
  for the first five Pokémon. Compare each Pokémon's stats through different generations
  to see trends and changes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like me to include data labels on the chart (e.g., display ''total''
  values at each point)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific type of line for each Pokémon (e.g., solid, dashed,
  or dotted)?

  4. Would you like a legend to identify each Pokémon on the chart?

  5. Should the x-axis be labeled with generation numbers or generation names?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like to highlight any specific generation or Pokémon on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  9. Should the y-axis be scaled to fit the range of ''total'' stats closely, or would
  you prefer standardized axis limits for a broader comparison?

  10. Would you like to add any annotations or notes to the chart to highlight specific
  trends or changes?'
