initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the total stats of Pokémon through
  different generations. Ensure the bars are grouped by generation and highlight any
  legendary Pokémon to distinguish them from others. Annotate the top three Pokémon
  with the highest total stats to make them stand out. This visualization will help
  compare the evolution of Pokémon stats across generations and identify trends or
  outliers among the legendary Pokémon, providing a clear overview of their performance
  spectrum. Use colors and labels for clarity and easy understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  each generation?

  2. How would you like the legendary Pokémon to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  pattern, or both)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations of the top three
  Pokémon?

  4. Should the bars representing the top three Pokémon with the highest stats be
  in a different color or pattern to stand out?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  6. Are there specific label formats you would like to use for the x-axis (generations)
  and y-axis (total stats)?

  7. Would you like a legend included in the chart to explain the color-coding or
  patterns?

  8. Should there be gridlines in the background to aid in reading the values?

  9. Do you prefer a specific order for the generations on the x-axis (e.g., ascending,
  descending)?'

  2. I am not sure, maybe a different color would work.
