initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing Pokemon stats. Use 'type1'
  and 'type2' as stacked categories with stats like 'total,' 'attack,' 'defense,'
  'sp_attack,' 'sp_defense,' and 'speed' as values on the Y-axis. Highlight legendary
  Pokemon to differentiate them. Annotate key Pokemon with their names and total stats
  to focus on specific examples. Visualize missing type2 data distinctly. The goal
  is to compare Pokemon types and highlight standout stats. This will help in identifying
  strengths and weaknesses across different types for better gaming strategies and
  team building.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different Pokemon types
  and categories?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout of the chart, such as the
  order of the stacked categories?

  3. Are there specific key Pokemon you would like to annotate, or should we select
  based on standout stats?

  4. How would you like the missing ''type2'' data to be visualized distinctly?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations of key Pokemon
  names and total stats?

  6. Would you prefer any specific highlighting style for legendary Pokemon, such
  as specific colors or markers?'
