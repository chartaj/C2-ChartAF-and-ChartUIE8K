initial_prompt: Please create a line chart displaying the progression of the Pokémon
  stats over generations. Use the 'total', 'hp', 'attack', 'defense', 'sp_attack',
  'sp_defense', and 'speed' columns as separate lines. The x-axis should represent
  the 'number' of the Pokémon, and the y-axis should reflect the different stat values.
  Include a legend to distinguish between the different stats. Ensure missing values
  are handled appropriately. This will help visualize the evolution of Pokémon attributes
  through the generations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different stat lines?

  2. What level of granularity do you want on the x-axis labels (e.g., every Pokémon,
  every 10 Pokémon, etc.)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Should the y-axis have a fixed range, or should it be dynamically adjusted based
  on the data?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines for better readability? If so, how dense should
  they be?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the axis
  labels, title, and legend?

  7. Do you want to highlight specific generations or key points in the chart?

  8. Should additional annotations or markers be added to indicate important events
  or milestones?

  9. How would you like missing values to be handled (e.g., interpolated, left blank)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and subtitle?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Every 10 Pokémon would be good.

  3. Solid lines would be preferred.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful. I have no specific preference for
  density.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have specific milestones in mind.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. The chart title could be "Evolution of Pokémon Stats Over Generations", but
