initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that visualizes the distribution of images by age
  group from the "Age Detection - Face Recognition Dataset". The x-axis should represent
  the unique age groups (e.g., '18-20', '21-25'), while the y-axis should show the
  count of images in each age group. Each bar should represent one age group, with
  the height corresponding to the number of images. Additionally, use different colors
  to differentiate between 'train' and 'test' splits within each age group to show
  the distribution across these categories as well.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between ''train''
  and ''test'' splits?

  2. Should the chart include labels for the counts on top of each bar?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be grouped or stacked to represent the ''train'' and
  ''test'' splits?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing ''train''
  and ''test'' splits?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the age groups to be displayed on the
  x-axis (e.g., ascending, descending, or custom order)?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart titles,
  axis labels, and legends?

  7. Should the axis labels include specific units or descriptions?

  8. Would you like to display grid lines on the chart to enhance readability?

  9. Should any annotations or additional information be included on the chart?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall dimensions or aspect ratio of the chart?'

  5. Ascending order for the age groups would be preferred on the x-axis.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific units or descriptions needed for the axis labels.

  8. Yes, display grid lines on the chart to enhance readability.

  9. I do not know.
