initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the Age Detection - Face Recognition
  Dataset. Plot 'file' on the x-axis and 'age' on the y-axis. Use different colors
  to distinguish 'split' values, highlighting 'train' and 'test' sets. Include annotations
  to pinpoint files associated with the youngest and oldest age groups, emphasizing
  their importance in understanding age distribution in the dataset. This will show
  how age ranges are distributed across different files in the dataset, useful for
  analyzing trends and patterns in age recognition using facial images.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing the ''train''
  and ''test'' sets?

  2. Which style would you like for the annotation of the youngest and oldest age
  groups (e.g., arrow, text box)?

  3. Should the y-axis (''age'') be categorized or remain as text?

  4. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the legend?

  5. Is there a particular font or size you would like for the labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like to include any gridlines for better readability?

  7. Should any specific themes or styles be applied to the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  bold)?

  8. Are there any specific points or files you want to highlight or that should be
  emphasized other than the youngest and oldest age groups?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I prefer text box annotations.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. No, just the youngest and oldest age groups should be emphasized.'
