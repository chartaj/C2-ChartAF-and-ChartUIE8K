initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of age categories
  in a face recognition dataset. Use text annotations to display the percentage of
  each age group within the pie slices. Highlight the age groups with different colors
  for clear distinction. Use this visualization to easily understand the demographic
  spread of the dataset which can help in analyzing the effectiveness of face recognition
  across different age groups. Ensure the chart is clear and informative, highlighting
  key segments for better insight into the dataset's age distribution. Include both
  train and other splits if available.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different age groups?

  2. Should the colors follow any particular theme or palette (e.g., monochromatic,
  contrasting)?

  3. Do you want the percentages to be displayed inside the pie slices or outside
  with lines pointing to the slices?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the pie chart include a legend, or should the labels on the slices be
  sufficient?

  6. Is there a preferred order for displaying the age groups (e.g., smallest to largest,
  alphabetical)?

  7. Do you want the "train" and "other" splits to be shown as separate pie charts
  side by side, or combined into a single pie chart?

  8. Are there any specific age groups or splits that you want to highlight or emphasize
  more than others?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the different age groups.

  2. I am not sure, any contrasting theme should be fine.

  3. I prefer the percentages to be displayed inside the pie slices.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the font style or size for the text
  annotations.

  5. The labels on the slices should be sufficient; no need for a legend.

  6. I do not know, you can choose an ordering that makes the most sense visually.

  7. I would like the "train" and "other" splits to be shown as separate pie charts
  side by side.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for highlighting any particular age groups
  or splits.'
