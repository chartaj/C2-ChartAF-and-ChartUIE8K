initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of Southeast Asian
  Bumblebee specimens. The heatmap should use the 'Country' and 'Species' columns,
  with the 'Year' column represented on the x-axis and the 'Species' on the y-axis.
  Each cell should show the count of specimens collected per species each year in
  different countries. Utilize color intensity to indicate higher counts. This will
  help to understand species diversity and survey frequency across various countries
  and time periods. The latitude and longitude data can be aggregated to understand
  geographical hotspots. Displaying collection data over time will highlight trends
  and collection efforts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels or annotations on the heatmap cells for specimen
  counts?

  3. Should the heatmap include a legend to indicate the color intensity scale?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to display aggregate geographical hotspot information directly
  on the heatmap or as a separate map visualization?

  6. Are there any specific countries or species you would like to emphasize or highlight
  on the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability and separation of
  years and species?'
answers: '1. I am not sure; I have no specific preference.

  2. Yes, I would like to include labels or annotations on the heatmap cells for specimen
  counts.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should definitely include a legend to indicate the color intensity
  scale.

  4. I am not sure; I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure; I have no specific preference.

  6. No, there are no specific countries or species I would like to emphasize or highlight
  on the heatmap.

  7. Yes, the heatmap should include gridlines for better readability and separation
  of years and species.'
