initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Southeast Asian Bumblebee specimens. I need a
  scatter plot to visualize the geographical distribution of these specimens. The
  x-axis should represent the 'Longitude' and the y-axis should represent the 'Latitude'.
  Use different colors or markers for each 'Species' to show their distribution patterns.
  Add labels for 'Country' to indicate the country each specimen was collected from.
  The goal is to understand how the locations of collected specimens vary by species
  and country within Southeast Asia. Use any missing value handling techniques if
  necessary.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to represent
  different species?

  2. Would you prefer specific marker shapes for different species, or is differentiating
  by color sufficient?

  3. How detailed should the country labels be? Do you want them to appear for every
  specimen or just at certain intervals?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels?

  5. Should the scatter plot include grid lines for better readability, or do you
  prefer a cleaner look?

  6. Do you want additional annotations or legends to provide more context about the
  data?

  7. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  8. Are there any specific requirements for axis labels or axis scaling?

  9. Do you want any specific background styling, such as a map or a plain background?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Differentiating by color is sufficient.

  3. I am not sure, maybe just at certain intervals would be fine.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. A cleaner look without grid lines is preferred.

  6. Yes, additional annotations or legends would be helpful.

  7. Yes, the chart should have a title. "Geographical Distribution of Southeast Asian
  Bumblebee Species"

  8. I have no specific preference for axis labels or scaling.

  9. A plain background is fine.'
