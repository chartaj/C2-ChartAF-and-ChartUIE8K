initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of bumblebee specimens
  by country, based on the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset. Use the "Country"
  column for the pie slices and the number of specimens (represented by the "_id"
  column) as the size metric. Additionally, add data-driven text annotations to show
  the exact number or percentage of specimens for each country. Highlight Thailand
  to emphasize its significance within the dataset. This will help in understanding
  which countries have more specimen records, providing insights into bumblebee population
  distribution in Southeast Asia.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the pie chart slices?

  2. Would you like the data-driven text annotations to display absolute numbers,
  percentages, or both?

  3. How would you like Thailand to be highlighted (e.g., different color, bold outline,
  etc.)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font type or size for the text annotations and labels?

  5. Should the pie chart include a legend, or is it sufficient to rely solely on
  the text annotations?

  6. How would you like the title of the chart to be phrased?

  7. Would you like to include any additional information or notes at the bottom or
  side of the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s dimensions (height and
  width)?

  9. Should the chart include grid lines or separators between the slices?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Both numbers and percentages would be ideal.

  3. A different color for Thailand would be great.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. "Distribution of Bumblebee Specimens by Country in Southeast Asia"

  7. I do not think that is necessary.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.'
