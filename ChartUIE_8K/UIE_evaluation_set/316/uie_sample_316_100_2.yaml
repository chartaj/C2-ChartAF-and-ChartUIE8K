initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset
  using a column chart. The x-axis should represent the species, and the y-axis should
  show the count of specimens collected. Highlight species with the highest and lowest
  counts using different colors to draw attention. Annotate the columns for those
  species, showing exact specimen counts. Include filters for year and month, so I
  can see trends over time. This will help in understanding the diversity and abundance
  of species in different regions and time periods.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. How would you like the labels for the x-axis (species) to be displayed? (angled,
  horizontal, vertical, etc.)

  3. Do you want a specific font style or size for the annotations and labels on the
  chart?

  4. Should the y-axis start at zero, or do you prefer a different starting point?

  5. Is there a particular order you would like the species on the x-axis to be displayed
  (alphabetical, by count, etc.)?

  6. Would you like to include a title and subtitle on the chart? If yes, please specify
  the text.

  7. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines on the chart (color, thickness,
  presence or absence)?

  8. Should the chart include a legend explaining the colors used for the highest
  and lowest counts?

  9. Do you prefer any specific style for the filters (dropdown, slider, etc.) for
  year and month?

  10. Are there any specific regions or locations within Southeast Asia that should
  be highlighted or given special attention in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Angled labels for the x-axis (species) would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The y-axis should start at zero.

  5. Display the species by count.

  6. Yes, please include a title "Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Counts" and a
  subtitle "Analysis of Specimen Collection by Species".

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, include a legend explaining the colors used for the highest and lowest counts.

  9. I am not sure.
