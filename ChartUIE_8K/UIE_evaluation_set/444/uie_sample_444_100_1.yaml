initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using public transit-infrastructure data. Plot
  'length' on the x-axis and 'cost_km_millions' on the y-axis. Add text annotations
  to show the 'city' and 'line' for each data point. Highlight points where 'tunnel_per'
  is 100%, making them stand out visually. Use colors to differentiate countries.
  This visualization will help analyze the relationship between project length and
  cost efficiency, focusing on completely tunneled projects and comparing them across
  different cities. The purpose is to identify trends and insights in government transit
  projects.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating countries?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for ''city'' and ''line'' to be formatted
  (e.g., font size, style)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape or size of the scatter plot points?

  4. What type of highlighting would you prefer for data points where ''tunnel_per''
  is 100% (e.g., different color, larger size, different shape)?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the scatter plot?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or scaling (e.g., log scale,
  specific range)?

  8. Should there be a legend included, and if so, any preferences on its placement?

  9. Are there any specific interactive elements or tooltips you would like to include
  for the text annotations? -> This will not include in response

  10. Would you like any additional information or data points to be displayed on
  the plot (e.g., start year, end year)?

  11. Is there a specific order you would like the data points to be displayed in?'
