initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the public transit-infrastructure costs
  in various Canadian cities. Include city names on the x-axis and the cost (in millions
  CAD) on the y-axis. Use different colors to distinguish between the years the projects
  started. Make sure to display the length of the route in kilometers as labels on
  top of each bar. This will help illustrate the government spending on transit projects
  in cities like Vancouver and Toronto, and how different projects vary in terms of
  budget and size. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  years the projects started?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for easier comparison of costs?

  3. Do you prefer the city names to be displayed horizontally or vertically on the
  x-axis?

  4. Is it important for you to display a legend to explain the colors used for different
  start years?

  5. How would you like the y-axis to be scaled? (e.g., linear, logarithmic)

  6. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels on top of
  each bar?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you want to add to emphasize
  particular data points or trends?'
