initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing transit-infrastructure costs across
  countries from the data. Highlight countries with the highest and lowest costs using
  colors. Annotate specific cities with the exact cost values to draw attention. The
  map will help understand the geographical distribution of public transit investments
  and identify areas with significant expenditures. Include contextual information
  using non-data-driven annotations for overall transit initiatives. Ensure the practical
  application of the data is clear, showing where government funds are being allocated
  for public transit infrastructure developments.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for highlighting the highest
  and lowest costs?

  2. How would you prefer the specific cities to be annotated on the map (e.g., labels,
  tooltips)?

  3. Would you like the map to include a legend for cost values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the base map style (e.g., political, physical, satellite)?

  5. Should the map include borders and labels for countries?

  6. Are there any additional contextual annotations you want included on the map
  aside from overall transit initiatives?

  7. Would you like the cost values to be displayed in any specific currency?'
