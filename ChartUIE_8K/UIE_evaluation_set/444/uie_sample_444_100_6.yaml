initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the cost per kilometer of public transit
  infrastructure projects across different cities and countries. Use data from 444.csv
  to compare how real costs vary based on length and tunnel percentage. Group the
  projects by city and plot the costs in millions of currency. The chart should highlight
  outliers to help identify exceptionally high or low costs. Include labels for each
  city and use different colors for each country to make the visual comparisons clearer.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used for different
  countries?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations for exceptionally high or low cost
  outliers?

  3. Is there a preferred way you''d like the tunnel percentage to be represented?

  4. Do you need any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you''d like for the labels and axis
  titles?

  6. Do you prefer gridlines to be shown on the chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend indicating which color corresponds
  to which country?

  8. Should the box plots be sorted in a particular order, such as by cost, length,
  or tunnel percentage?

  9. Do you have a specific format for the axis labels, for example, representing
  costs in millions?

  10. Are there any additional elements or highlights you would like to include in
  the chart, such as average lines or trend lines?'
