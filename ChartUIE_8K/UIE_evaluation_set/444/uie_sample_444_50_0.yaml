initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the cost per km of different public
  transit lines in Canada. Annotate significant deviations and trends. Highlight start
  and end years, tunnel percentages, and station counts for context. This will help
  compare the efficiency and investment in various city projects.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific color gradient for highlighting the cost per km?

  3. How would you prefer significant deviations to be annotated (e.g., symbols, text
  annotations)?

  4. Do you want the start and end years displayed prominently on the chart?

  5. How would you like the tunnel percentages to be represented (e.g., as a separate
  legend, integrated into the heatmap cells)?

  6. Should the station counts be displayed on the heatmap itself or as a tooltip
  on hover?

  7. Do you have a preference for the shape and size of the heatmap cells?

  8. Would you prefer the axis labels (e.g., city names, line names) to be displayed
  horizontally or vertically?

  9. How much detail would you like in the chart''s legend?

  10. Are there any specific trends or deviations you want to be highlighted in a
  particular way?'
