initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of project lengths
  for public transit infrastructure projects. Use the 'length' column from the data
  provided. Highlight the tunnels specifically by using a different color or pattern
  for the bins representing tunnel lengths in the 'tunnel' column. Include a legend
  to distinguish between total project length and tunnel length. Title the chart to
  reflect the focus on public transit infrastructure and provide axis labels for clarity.
  This will help visualize the spread and frequency of different project lengths across
  various cities and countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color or pattern used
  to highlight the tunnel lengths?

  2. What color palette would you prefer for the histogram bins representing total
  project lengths?

  3. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  4. Would you like specific axis labels, or should we use ''Project Length (km)''
  for x-axis and ''Frequency'' for y-axis?

  5. Is there a specific bin width preference for the histogram?

  6. Should we use a particular font style or size for the legend and axis labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. ''Project Length (km)'' for x-axis and ''Frequency'' for y-axis are fine.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.'
