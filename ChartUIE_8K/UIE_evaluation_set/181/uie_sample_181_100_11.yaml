initial_prompt: Please create a treemap chart visualizing the data on Taylor Swift's
  concert tours. The chart should display cities as the primary categories, with subcategories
  showing venues. The size of each cell in the treemap should correspond to the attendance
  numbers (tickets sold). Additionally, use different colors to represent the revenue
  generated in those cities. This will help illustrate the impact of her tours on
  attendance and revenue across various locations. Make sure to highlight significant
  patterns or outliers in the treemap. The treemap should be easy to navigate and
  visually comprehensible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing the revenue generated
  in different cities?

  2. Should the treemap highlight specific cities or venues known for significantly
  high or low attendance using distinct colors or borders?

  3. Do you want to include any labels or tooltips for better clarity when users hover
  over particular areas in the treemap?

  4. Is there a set limit on the number of cities or venues to display in the treemap
  to maintain visual clarity?

  5. Are there any specific patterns or outliers you are particularly interested in
  highlighting in the treemap?

  6. Would you like to add a legend or any sort of annotation to explain the color
  coding and size differences used in the treemap?

  7. Should the chart include a title and subtitle to provide context about the data
  being visualized?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for any text elements such
  as labels or annotations within the treemap?'
