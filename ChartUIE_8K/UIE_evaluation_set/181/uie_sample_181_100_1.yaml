initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize Taylor Swift's tour data,
  focusing on attendance and revenue across different cities and venues. Highlight
  sold-out shows for emphasis. Add text annotations for notable attendance or revenue
  figures to draw attention. The chart should tell a story of Taylor's concert impact,
  showing which cities had the highest attendance and revenue. The purpose is to analyze
  the success of her Fearless Tour, with a practical view of market differences and
  fanbase strength across locations. Ensure it is engaging with relevant annotations
  and highlights for clarity.
