initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing concert attendance and revenue for Taylor
  Swift's "Fearless Tour" in different US cities. Each dot represents a concert event
  with its position reflecting the number of tickets sold and revenue generated. Highlight
  the top three highest revenue events with annotations showing exact figures. Use
  different colors for cities to enhance visual distinction. Visualize the data to
  assess the impact of the event's location on attendance and revenue.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme to represent
  different cities?

  2. Should the dots be sized based on another attribute, such as venue capacity?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the annotations on the top three highest
  revenue events (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the plot for better readability?

  5. Do you have a specific preference for the axis scale type (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors used for different cities?

  7. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the chart title and axis labels?

  8. Would you like the data points to be labeled with city names or any other attribute?

  9. Should we include a trend line to visualize any correlation between attendance
  and revenue?

  10. Is there a specific background style or color preference for the chart?'
