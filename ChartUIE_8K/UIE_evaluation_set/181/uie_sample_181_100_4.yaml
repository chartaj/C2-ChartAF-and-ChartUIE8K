initial_prompt: Create a table chart visualizing the summarized data from Taylor's
  concert tours. The table should include the City, Country, Venue, Opening act(s),
  Attendance (tickets sold / available), Revenue, and Tour columns. Highlight missing
  values, unique values, and data types where applicable. Each city should have corresponding
  details including sold/available tickets and revenue generated. I want to compare
  attendance and revenue across different cities and tours, thus understanding the
  impact of the Fearless Tour on different locations. Please ensure the table is clear
  and easy to interpret.

  of the table chart?

  2. Is there any particular format you prefer for highlighting missing values, such
  as specific colors or symbols?

  3. Would you like the unique values to be highlighted in a specific manner (e.g.,
  bold, underline, different color)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for how data types should be indicated in the table?

  5. Should the columns or rows be sorted in any particular order, such as by city,
  tour, or revenue?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for better readability?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the alignment of text within the cells?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or footnotes to be included in the
  table for context or explanations?

  9. Are there any specific formatting requirements for numerical values, such as
  currency formatting for revenue?

  10. Would you like to include any legends or keys to explain the highlighted elements
  within the chart?'
