initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the total attendance and revenue by
  city for the Fearless Tour. Use colors to differentiate between attendance (in thousands)
  and revenue (in thousands of dollars). The X-axis should list the cities and the
  Y-axis should represent the count (both attendance and revenue). Include a legend
  to distinguish between the two. Highlight cities with missing values differently
  to indicate gaps in data. This chart should make it easy to compare how different
  cities performed both in terms of audience size and financial success.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between attendance
  and revenue bars?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be highlighted (e.g., specific color,
  pattern)?

  3. Should the Y-axis use a single scale for both attendance and revenue, or separate
  scales on either side?

  4. Is there a preferred order for listing cities on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by size of attendance, by revenue)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the format of the legend?

  6. Are there any specific title or labels you would like to include for the chart
  and axes?

  7. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed side by side or stacked?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I think a pattern would be good for highlighting missing values.

  3. Separate scales on either side would be ideal.

  4. By size of attendance.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No specific titles or labels, just something descriptive.

  7. Side by side would be better.'
