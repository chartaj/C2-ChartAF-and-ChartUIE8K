initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the proportion of unique 'RECORD'
  entries in the ECG dataset segmented by 'ECG_signal' types. Highlight the 'ARR'
  category prominently as it appears frequently in the sample data. Annotate the pie
  slices with the count and percentage of each 'ECG_signal' type to emphasize occurrence
  rates. Use distinct colors for different 'ECG_signal' categories like 'ARR' and
  others. This will illustrate the distribution of cardiac ailment types in the dataset,
  aiding in easy comparison and analysis of their prevalence.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different ''ECG_signal''
  categories?

  2. How would you like the ''ARR'' category to be highlighted (e.g., with a specific
  color, bolder outline, or larger segment)?

  3. Do you prefer the annotations (count and percentage) to be inside or outside
  the pie slices?

  4. Should there be any additional labels or legends included in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the annotations
  and labels?

  6. Would you like the chart to include a title? If yes, please specify the title.

  7. Should the chart display the exact numbers or round the percentages for the annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. With a specific color.

  3. Inside the pie slices.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, "Distribution of ECG Signal Types in the Dataset".

  7. Round the percentages for the annotations.'
