initial_prompt: Create a circular treemap using the ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset.
  Visualize data columns like 'RECORD,' 'hbpermin,' and 'ECGseg.' Ensure each segment
  displays unique data values, missing values, and data type for context. Highlight
  key metrics like 'QTseg,' 'RRmean,' and 'SDRR.' Make sure colors represent 'ECG_signal'
  categories. Include sample data points to provide an overview. Use this data to
  display variability in cardiac metrics among patients. The treemap should help identify
  patterns and anomalies in heart function effectively. Ensure it's interactive for
  detailed insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or theme for the treemap?

  2. Should the segments be labeled with any specific details other than unique data
  values, missing values, and data type?

  3. How would you like the key metrics ''QTseg,'' ''RRmean,'' and ''SDRR'' to be
  highlighted within the segments?

  4. Do you want specific data points or sample size to be emphasized more than others
  in the treemap?

  5. Is there any particular way you prefer the ''ECG_signal'' categories to be represented
  through colors?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font type and size used in the labels and annotations?

  7. Are there any specific statistics or summary details you want included beside
  the treemap?

  8. Would you prefer a specific layout or structure (e.g., hierarchical, flat) for
  the circular treemap?

  9. How much detail would you like to include in the tooltip or hover information
  when viewing each segment?'
