initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of unique ECG signals
  ('ARR') in the dataset. Use text annotations to display the count of each signal
  type in the chart segments. Highlight the segment with the highest frequency to
  emphasize its predominance. The chart should help in understanding the prevalence
  of specific cardiac ailments within the dataset. Annotate any significant differences
  or outliers in the distribution to draw attention to potential areas of interest
  for further analysis in cardiac research. Ensure the chart is visually appealing
  and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the donut chart?

  2. How would you like the segment with the highest frequency to be highlighted (different
  color, pattern, etc.)?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations to be placed (inside the segments,
  outside the segments, with lines pointing to segments)?

  4. What font size and style do you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you want a legend to accompany the donut chart?

  6. Would you like the chart to include a title and/or subtitle? If yes, what should
  they be?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for labeling the axes or chart segments?

  8. Are there any additional data points or information you would like to include
  in the annotations?

  9. Do you have a specific preference for the chart''s background color or grid lines?

  10. Would you like to include any introductory or explanatory text on the chart
  to provide context for the audience?'
