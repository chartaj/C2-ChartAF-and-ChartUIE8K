initial_prompt: Create a circular treemap visualization using the "ECG of Cardiac
  Ailments Dataset" to highlight data on heart rate variability, segment durations,
  and ECG signals. Emphasize unique values distribution and missing values per column.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the circular
  treemap?

  2. Should the circular treemap include labels for each segment, or would you prefer
  a tooltip approach for additional information?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size of the segments to be based on a particular
  data attribute?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds or ranges you want to highlight for missing
  values or unique values distribution?

  5. Would you like to incorporate any specific legends or annotations to help interpret
  the variabilities in the data?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text elements in the
  visualization?

  7. Is there a particular layout or hierarchical structure you want to maintain within
  the circular treemap for better clarity?

  8. Are there any specific data attributes you want to emphasize more than others
  within the visualization?'
