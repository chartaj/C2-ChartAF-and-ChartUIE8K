initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart using the ECG of Cardiac Ailments
  Dataset, focusing on columns like "hbpermin," "PQseg," "QRSseg," "QTseg," and "STseg."
  Highlight patterns across these attributes to help visualize differences in ECG
  signals for cardiac conditions. Make sure to include labels for better understanding
  and color-code the lines based on the "ECG_signal" column. This chart will help
  in identifying trends and anomalies in heartbeats and segments that can indicate
  various cardiac issues. Ensure the chart is interactive for detailed exploration
  and analysis.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for color-coding\
  \ the lines based on the 'ECG_signal' column?\n2. Should the chart include grid\
  \ lines for better readability?\n3. Do you prefer any specific style or font for\
  \ the labels?\n4. Would you like to add tooltips for additional data points or explanations\
  \ when hovering over the lines?\n5. Should the axis ranges be automatically scaled,\
  \ or would you prefer to set custom ranges?\n6. Do you have any specific preferences\
  \ for the line styles or thickness? \n7. Should we include a legend to explain the\
  \ color-coding of the 'ECG_signal' column?\n8. Would you like to display any statistical\
  \ summaries or markers for key data points or anomalies on the chart?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette, go with what you think is best.

  2. Yes, the chart should include grid lines for better readability.

  3. I have no specific preference for the style or font for the labels.

  4. Yes, please add tooltips for additional data points or explanations when hovering
  over the lines.

  5. I am not sure about the axis ranges, you can decide what''s best.

  6. I do not know about the line styles or thickness, choose what you think works
  well.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color-coding of the ''ECG_signal''
  column.

  8. I would like to display statistical summaries or markers for key data points
  or anomalies on the chart.'
