initial_prompt: Please visualize the data using a Dumbbell chart comparing "QTdis"
  and "QToffdis" across multiple records. Place the record numbers on the Y-axis and
  the "QTdis" and "QToffdis" values on the X-axis to show the differences. Make sure
  the data points are connected to indicate the increase or decrease between these
  two measurements. This will help in comparing the duration changes for each record,
  illustrating patterns in the ECG readings related to cardiac ailments.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the data points or connecting
  lines?

  2. Would you like the chart to display any grid lines for better readability, and
  if so, in which direction (X-axis, Y-axis, or both)?

  3. Should there be data labels showing the exact QTdis and QToffdis values for each
  record?

  4. Do you prefer any specific marker style (e.g., circles, squares) for the QTdis
  and QToffdis data points?

  5. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If yes, do you
  have specific wording in mind?

  6. Are there any preferences for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between QTdis and QToffdis,
  and if so, where would you like it positioned (top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Do you want to apply any specific scaling (e.g., logarithmic) to the X-axis?

  9. Would you like annotations or callouts highlighting significant changes or patterns
  in the differences between QTdis and QToffdis?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you''d like to highlight on the
  chart for medical interpretation?'
