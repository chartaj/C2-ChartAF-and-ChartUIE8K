initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing ECG signals with different cardiac
  ailments from the given dataset, focusing on the percentage distribution of signals
  and the highlights on abnormal segments. Annotations should emphasize key data points,
  such as mean heartbeats and significant ECG segment values for analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different segments in the donut
  chart?

  2. Would you like labels to be displayed on or outside the donut slices?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the annotations?

  4. How detailed should the annotations be (e.g., just key data points or more detailed
  explanations)?

  5. Would you prefer the legend to be displayed within the chart or separately?

  6. Should there be a particular order for the segments (e.g., by frequency, alphabetical)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall chart size or aspect ratio?

  8. Should the chart include a title or subtitle, and if so, what should it be?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Outside the donut slices.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Key data points.

  5. Separately.

  6. By frequency.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. Yes, the title should be "ECG Signal Distribution Across Cardiac Ailments" and
  the subtitle "Focus on Abnormal Segments and Key Data Points".'
