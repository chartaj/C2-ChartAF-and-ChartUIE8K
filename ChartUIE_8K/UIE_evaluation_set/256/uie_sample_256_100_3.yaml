initial_prompt: I have ECG data representing various cardiac measurements for patients
  with possible cardiac ailments. I want to visualize the distribution of the heartbeats
  per minute (hbpermin) against the QT segment duration (QTseg) for different records.
  Please create a hexbin chart that displays the density of these two variables, with
  increased color intensity indicating higher data point density. This visualization
  should help identify common ranges and clusters in heartbeats and QT segment durations
  across the dataset. Ensure the hexbin chart highlights any potential outliers or
  patterns in the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the hexbin chart?

  2. What range of values would you like the color intensity to represent?

  3. Do you prefer a specific hexbin size or grid resolution?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  5. Should the axes have specific scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers on the chart?

  8. How would you like outliers to be visually represented?

  9. Should there be any specific legends or captions included with the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer a moderate hexbin size, nothing too small or too large.

  4. Yes, labels for heartbeats per minute and QT segment duration would be helpful.

  5. A linear scale should be fine for both axes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific reference lines or markers are needed.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, a legend indicating the density levels would be useful.'
