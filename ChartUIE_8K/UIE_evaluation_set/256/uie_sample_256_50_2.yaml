initial_prompt: Create a column chart highlighting key ECG metrics like 'hbpermin',
  'QTseg', and 'ECG_signal'. Use text annotations to emphasize any extreme values
  or notable ECG segments. The chart should clearly show comparisons between these
  elements, using colors to enhance the differences. Add context to make the data
  insights clear.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific colors to be used in the
  chart to distinguish between ''hbpermin'', ''QTseg'', and ''ECG_signal''?

  2. Would you like the chart to display values on top of each bar for better clarity?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  position)?

  4. Do you have a specific format for labeling the axes (e.g., titles, units, etc.)?

  5. Are there any specific thresholds or criteria for determining what constitutes
  an "extreme value" or "notable segment" in the data?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for easier reading of values?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to clarify what each color represents?

  8. Are there any specific contextual information or commentary you want to be included
  directly within the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific chart size or aspect ratio for optimal viewing?

  10. Should the chart include error bars or other indicators of variability, if applicable?'
