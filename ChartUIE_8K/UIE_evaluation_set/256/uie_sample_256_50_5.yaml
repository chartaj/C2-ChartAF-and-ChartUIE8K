initial_prompt: Visualize the ECG data as an area chart showing heart rate variability
  (SDRR, RMSSD) over time for different records. Highlight noticeable variations and
  anomalies in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to indicate
  different records or anomalies?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier data interpretation?

  3. Should the chart include tooltips or labels for precise value display when hovering
  over the data points?

  4. Do you prefer the area under the curve to be filled with a solid color or a gradient?

  5. Would you like to use any specific markers to highlight anomalies in the data?

  6. Should the x-axis represent time in a specific format (e.g., seconds, minutes,
  hours)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart''s title or labels for the axes?

  8. Would you like to add any benchmarks or reference lines to indicate normal or
  critical values in heart rate variability?'
