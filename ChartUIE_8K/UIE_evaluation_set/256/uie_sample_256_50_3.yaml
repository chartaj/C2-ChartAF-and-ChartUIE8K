initial_prompt: Please create a hexagonal binning chart visualizing the relationship

  color intensity to represent density of data points, highlighting areas with higher
  concentrations. Add axis labels and a legend.

  7. Is there a particular style or theme that you would like the chart to follow
  (e.g., dark mode, minimalistic, etc.)?'
