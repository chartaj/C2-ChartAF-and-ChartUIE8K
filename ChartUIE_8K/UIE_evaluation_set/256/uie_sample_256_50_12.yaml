initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing various ECG segment durations (Pseg,
  PQseg, QRSseg, etc.) against the number of heartbeats per minute (hbpermin). Use
  the size of the bubbles to represent the QT segment duration.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bubbles?\n2. Do you\
  \ want the chart to have labeled axes, and if so, what specific labels should be\
  \ used?\n3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart background?\n\
  4. Do you have a preference for the bubble sizes, such as a specific range or scale?\n\
  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the bubble sizes?\n6. Are there\
  \ any specific data points or segments that you want to highlight on the chart?\
  \ \n7. Do you have a preferred layout or ordering for the ECG segments on the x-axis?\n\
  8. Would you like to include any reference lines (e.g., average values, thresholds)\
  \ in the chart?\n9. Should the chart title include specific information, and if\
  \ so, what should it be?\n10. Do you have any preferences regarding the font type\
  \ or size for the chart labels and title?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please label the x-axis as "ECG Segment Durations (ms)" and the y-axis as
  "Heartbeats per Minute (hbpermin)".

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the bubble sizes.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, the chart title should be "Correlation between ECG Segment Durations and
  Heartbeats per Minute".
