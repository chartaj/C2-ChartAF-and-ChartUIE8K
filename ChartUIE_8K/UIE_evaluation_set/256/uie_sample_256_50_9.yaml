initial_prompt: Please create a parallel coordinates chart using the ECG of Cardiac
  Ailments Dataset. Visualize columns like hbpermin, PQseg, QRseg, QTseg, RSseg, and
  any other relevant ones. This should help analyze patterns in ECG signals.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for representing different
  ECG attributes?

  2. Should the axes be standardized (same scale) or independent (individual scale
  per attribute)?

  3. Would you like to highlight specific ranges or thresholds within the attributes?

  4. Do you prefer including additional relevant columns beyond the mentioned attributes?

  5. Should the chart include any specific annotations or labels to emphasize particular
  data points or patterns?

  6. Is there a preferred background style (light or dark) for the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a legend or key to help interpret the attributes and their
  scales?

  8. Would you like to display any statistical summaries or trend lines within the
  chart?'
