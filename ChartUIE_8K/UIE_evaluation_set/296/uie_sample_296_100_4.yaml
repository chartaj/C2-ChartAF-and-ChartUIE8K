initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the geographical distribution
  of top-rated attractions and restaurants in Colombo. Use the address data to pinpoint
  each location on the map. Highlight areas based on their ranking position and average
  rating. Additionally, include pop-up details showing the name, category, rating,
  and number of reviews when hovering over each point. Ensure the map distinguishes
  clearly between attractions and restaurants, possibly through different color coding
  or icons. This will help in identifying the prime spots in Colombo with high tourist
  interest.
