initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot showing the rankings of top attractions and
  restaurants in Colombo based on TripAdvisor reviews. Use the "rankingPosition" for
  the x-axis and "rating" for the y-axis. Differentiate between ''ATTRACTION'' and
  ''RESTAURANT'' using different colors. Add data points for "name" and include tooltips
