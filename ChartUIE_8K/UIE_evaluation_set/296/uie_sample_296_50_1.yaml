initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing Colombo's top 200 spots from TripAdvisor,
  highlighting attractions, restaurants, and hotels. Annotate top-rated locations
  with ratings and review counts for emphasis. Use color differences to distinguish
  categories and visual cues to spotlight top-ranked places, drawing viewer attention
  to their popularity and user reviews.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between attractions,
  restaurants, and hotels?

  2. How would you like the top-rated locations to be annotated? For example, specific
  placement or style of text.

  3. Do you have a preference for how the size of each rectangle in the treemap should
  be determined (e.g., based on ranking position, number of reviews, or rating)?

  4. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations?

  5. Would you like specific visual cues (such as borders or icons) to spotlight top-ranked
  places, and if so, do you have preferences for these cues?

  6. Do you want to include any additional information or filters (e.g., price level)
  in the treemap visualization?'

  2. I am not sure about the text placement or style.

  3. I am not sure how the size should be determined.

  4. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  5. Yes, please use visual cues to spotlight top-ranked places, but I am not sure
  about the specific cues to use.
