initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationship between job satisfaction,
  work-life balance, and attrition rates. Highlight values over 70% in red to emphasize
  critical areas. Annotate cells with exact percentages to focus attention on specific
  data points, providing clarity on high attrition zones. This helps understand employee
  retention factors.
