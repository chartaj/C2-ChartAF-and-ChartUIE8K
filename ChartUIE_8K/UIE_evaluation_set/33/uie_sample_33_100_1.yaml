initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the correlation among various
  attributes like Age, DailyRate, DistanceFromHome, MonthlyIncome, and YearsAtCompany
  from the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset. Highlight areas
  of high correlation with a different color. Include text annotations to show values
  of key correlations that might indicate attrition risk factors, such as low job
  satisfaction or high overtime. Your visualization should make it easy to identify
  patterns that could help in understanding and reducing employee attrition. Use color
  gradients effectively to emphasize the importance of these correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. What color would you like to use to highlight areas of high correlation?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the text annotations?

  4. Are there any specific correlation threshold values that should be annotated?

  5. Should the annotations show all correlation values, or only key correlations
  indicating potential attrition risk factors?

  6. Would you like to include any titles or labels to provide additional context
  within the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the placement or appearance of the legend?

  8. Are there any specific instructions for the axis labels and tick marks?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette in mind.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Annotate only key correlations indicating potential attrition risk factors.

  6. A title indicating it''s a heatmap of correlations among attributes should be
  included.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for the placement or appearance of the
  legend.

  8. I do not have any specific instructions for the axis labels and tick marks.'
