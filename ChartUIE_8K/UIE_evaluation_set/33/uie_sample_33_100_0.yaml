initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the count of employees based
  on Attrition (Yes/No) segmented by Gender. Highlight the "Yes" values in a distinct
  color to emphasize attrition cases. Annotate the chart with specific data points
  for Age and MonthlyIncome to draw attention to any insights on age and income distribution
  among those who left. This will help understand the demographic and financial profile
  of employees who are leaving and assist in strategic HR planning. The chart should
  be clear and easy to interpret for HR analysis.

  in the stacked bar chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific fonts or font sizes for the annotations and labels
  on the chart?

  4. Is there a particular format in which you would like the age and monthly income
  data points to be annotated (e.g., numerical values, percentages)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s layout, such as its aspect ratio
  or size?

  6. Are there any legends or additional text information you would like to be included
  in the chart?

  should be displayed in the chart?

  beyond general trends?'
