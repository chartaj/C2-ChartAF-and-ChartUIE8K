initial_prompt: Visualize employee attrition data using a histogram to show the distribution
  of ages. Highlight specific age ranges with high or low attrition rates using different
  colors. Annotate key data points to indicate significant attrition rates, focusing
  the viewer's attention on these areas. This will help in understanding the relation
