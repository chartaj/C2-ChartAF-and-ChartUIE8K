initial_prompt: I need a donut chart that visualizes the food consumption data for
  different countries. Each section should represent a different food category like
  Red Meat, White Meat, Eggs, etc. Within these sections, highlight specific countries
  to show their consumption prominently. Add text annotations to display the exact
  amounts for each highlighted country. This chart will help compare diet compositions
  across regions and identify unique patterns. Make sure itâ€™s easy to distinguish
  between the food categories and countries for better understanding. Use colors effectively
  to separate different foods and countries clearly. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different food categories?

  2. How many countries would you like to highlight within each food category?

  3. Do you have specific countries in mind that you want to highlight?

  4. Would you prefer a specific format for the text annotations displaying exact
  amounts (e.g., decimals, percentages)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding for countries and
  food categories?

  6. Do you want the food categories to be ordered in a specific way around the donut
  chart?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations and labels on
  the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle on the chart for context?

  9. Are there any additional notes or information that you would like to include
  on the chart for better understanding?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, maybe around 3-4 countries per food category.

  3. Yes, can you highlight the USA, UK, China, and India?

  4. Percentages would be ideal.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include a title "Food Consumption by Country and Food Category" and
  a subtitle "Comparison of dietary composition across selected countries".

  9. No, that''s all I need. Thank you!'
