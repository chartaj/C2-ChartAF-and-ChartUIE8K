initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the ../Extra_datas/data/448.csv data file.
  Plot each country's Red Meat consumption on the x-axis and White Meat consumption
  on the y-axis to visualize the relationship between these two variables. Each point
  should represent a different country. Additionally, use different colors or markers
  to represent unique countries. This will help in understanding the dietary patterns
  of different countries with regard to meat consumption. Please label the axes appropriately
  (e.g., "Red Meat Consumption" and "White Meat Consumption") and include a legend
  to identify the countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for each country?

  2. Would you like to use different markers for each country, or would different
  colors suffice?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Would you like a title for the scatter plot? If yes, what should it be?

  5. Should the plot include gridlines to improve readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific dimensions for the chart (e.g., width and height)?

  7. Would you like to include data labels (e.g., country names) directly on the scatter
  plot points?

  8. Do you have a preferred style for the legend (e.g., location, layout)?

  9. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the x-axis (Red Meat Consumption)
  and y-axis (White Meat Consumption)?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for each country.

  2. Different colors will suffice.

  3. I do not have specific font preferences for the axis labels and legend.

  4. I am not sure if a title is needed.

  5. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful.

  6. I do not know any specific dimensions for the chart.

  7. I am not sure if data labels should be included directly on the scatter plot
  points.

  8. I do not have a preferred style for the legend.
