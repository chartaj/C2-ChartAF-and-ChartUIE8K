initial_prompt: 'Create a radar chart to visualize the food consumption data for each
  country. Include all the food categories: Red Meat, White Meat, Eggs, Milk, Fish,
  Cereals, Starch, Nuts, and Fruits & Vegetables. Each axis should represent one of
  these categories, and each country should be a separate line on the radar chart.
  Highlight differences in dietary patterns between countries. Use distinct colors
  for each country and label them clearly. Ensure that the chart is clear, with axis
  lines and data points well-defined. This will help compare the dietary habits visually
  across the different countries.'

  8. Would you like to include grid lines within the radar chart for better visibility

  9. Do you have any preferences for the arrangement or order of the food categories
  on the axes?

  10. Should the data points on each axis be marked distinctly (e.g., with markers
  or dots)?

  11. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to add to the chart?'
