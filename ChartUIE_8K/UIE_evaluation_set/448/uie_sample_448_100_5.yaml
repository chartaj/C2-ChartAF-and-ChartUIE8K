initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map displaying the average consumption of different
  food types by country. The map should highlight each country in varying shades based
  on their consumption levels of red meat, white meat, eggs, milk, fish, cereals,
  starch, nuts, and fruits & vegetables. Use the dataset provided to populate the
  map, ensuring the color gradients represent low to high consumption rates. Include
  labels and a legend to make it easy to interpret which countries have higher or
  lower consumption in each food category. The map should offer options to toggle
  between different food types for detailed analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used in the choropleth
  map (e.g., specific color ranges for low to high consumption)?

  2. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the labels on the map?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to emphasize or highlight?

  5. Would you like to include any additional context or annotations on the map (e.g.,
  average global consumption for comparison)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  7. Would you prefer the map to display country names within the borders or only
  upon hovering/clicking?'
