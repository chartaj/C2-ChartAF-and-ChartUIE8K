initial_prompt: I need a line chart comparing the consumption trends of different
  food categories across various countries. Specifically, plot the average consumption
  of Red Meat, White Meat, Eggs, Milk, Fish, Cereals, Starch, Nuts, and Fruits & Vegetables
  for each country. Use distinct lines for each food category, with the x-axis representing
  the countries and the y-axis showing the average consumption values. Ensure that
  all food categories are clearly labeled and use different colors or markers for
  each line to avoid confusion. This will help visualize which countries consume more
  or less of specific food types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each food category line?

  2. Do you prefer any particular style or shape for the markers of each line?

  3. Should the chart include a grid to make it easier to compare values across countries?

  4. Would you like to have data labels on the lines to show the exact values at certain
  points?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Should the countries on the x-axis be sorted in a specific way (e.g., alphabetically,
  by region)?

  7. Would you like to use any specific font style or size for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  8. Do you require any specific line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) for different
  categories?

  9. Should the chart include annotations or notes for specific countries or data
  points?

  10. Do you prefer the chart to have a specific title and subtitle? If so, please
  provide them.

  11. Do you want any particular axis scaling or limits for the y-axis?'
