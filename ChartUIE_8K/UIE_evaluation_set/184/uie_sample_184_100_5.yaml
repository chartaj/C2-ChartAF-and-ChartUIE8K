initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of critic scores
  for the top movies listed in the dataset titled "Rotten Tomatoes Top Movies Ratings
  and Technical." The x-axis should represent the critic score ranges, and the y-axis
  should represent the number of movies falling within each score range. Make sure
  to clearly label the axis and include a suitable title. This will help visualize
  how often certain critic scores are assigned to these top movies across different
  genres and years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Are there specific score ranges you want highlighted or categorized differently
  on the x-axis?

  3. Do you have any specific colors you want used for the bars in the histogram?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  5. Do you want any grid lines or reference lines included in the histogram?

  6. Should the histogram include a legend or any annotations?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., vertical
  bars, horizontal bars)?

  8. Are there any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer?

  9. Would you like to include any additional textual information or descriptions
  on the chart itself?

  10. Do you want any specific formatting for the y-axis labels (e.g., exact counts,
  percentages)?'
