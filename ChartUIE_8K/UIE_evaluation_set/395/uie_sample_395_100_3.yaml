initial_prompt: I want a network diagram illustrating the dependencies among various
  components in a software package. Imagine nodes representing each component name,
  size indicating relative importance or frequency of use, and directed edges showing
  import relationships. For instance, show "flare.analytics.cluster.AgglomerativeCluster"
  linking to all its imports like "flare.animate.Transitioner". Highlight clusters
  and community structures within the network. Utilize distinctive colors or sizes
  to depict nodes' unique values and missing values status. The goal is to clearly
  visualize interconnectedness and dependency structure for better understanding and
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to represent different
  clusters or community structures in the network diagram?

  2. Are there specific colors you would like to use to depict unique values and missing
  values in the nodes?

  3. Would you like the sizes of the nodes to be proportional to the actual size values
  or should there be specific size categories?

  4. How would you like the directed edges to be styled (e.g., arrow type, line thickness)
  to clearly indicate dependency relationships?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for the network diagram (e.g., circular, hierarchical,
  force-directed)?

  6. Should there be labels displayed on the nodes, and if so, what information should
  they contain?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or tooltips you would like to include for
  better context or details on the nodes and edges?

  8. Should the clusters be highlighted using borders, backgrounds, or any other stylistic
  approach? If so, please specify.

  9. Are there any additional legends or keys you would like to have included for
  explaining the node sizes, colors, or edge styles?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. The sizes should be proportional to the actual size values.

  4. I would like the directed edges to have clear arrowheads and different line thicknesses
  to indicate the strength or type of dependency.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, labels should be displayed on the nodes, containing the component names.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, clusters should be highlighted using borders.

  9. I am not sure.
