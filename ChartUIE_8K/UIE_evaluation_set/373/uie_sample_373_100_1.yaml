  Create a scatter plot comparing the GDP and Unemployment Rate of different countries.
  Annotate key countries such as the United States, China, and Japan with text annotations
  displaying their exact values for clear visibility. Use highlights to make these

  economic data across countries, focusing on significant players in the global economy.
  The chart will be used for social science research and analysis, demonstrating the
  relationship between a countryâ€™s GDP and its unemployment rate.
