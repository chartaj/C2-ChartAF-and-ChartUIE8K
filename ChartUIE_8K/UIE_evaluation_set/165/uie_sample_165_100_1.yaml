initial_prompt: Visualize the lung cancer prediction data using a bar chart. The x-axis
  should represent conditions like Smoking, Air Pollution, and Dust Allergy. The y-axis
  should quantify the number of patients. Highlight significant conditions with colors
  to differentiate risk levels (Low, Medium, High). Use text annotations to display
  exact patient numbers for each condition. The aim is to emphasize key factors contributing
  to lung cancer, aiding both public awareness and medical research. Ensure clarity
  and visual appeal to facilitate easy comprehension of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting different risk
  levels (Low, Medium, High)?

  2. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal bar charts?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the text annotations
  displaying patient numbers?

  4. Do you want a legend indicating the color scheme for the different risk levels?

  5. Is there a maximum number of conditions you want to display on the x-axis?

  6. Do you prefer exact patient numbers to be shown inside the bars or above the
  bars?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you have any preference for the chart title and axis labels style or content?

  9. Should the chart include any additional information or context beyond the conditions
  and patient counts?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart margins, padding, or overall
  layout?'
