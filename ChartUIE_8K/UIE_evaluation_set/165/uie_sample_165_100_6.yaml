initial_prompt: I'd like a bubble chart to visualize this health data for lung cancer
  prediction. Use Age, Air Pollution, Alcohol Use, Dust Allergy, Smoking, and Genetic
  Risk on the x and y axes. The bubble sizes should represent the Level of lung cancer
  risk (Low, Medium, High). Different colors should denote Gender. Please ensure it's
  easy to see the potential correlation between these factors and lung cancer risk.
  Use the sample data provided (first three entries) for this visualization. This
  will help identify any patterns or trends in lung cancer predictors. Include a legend
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different genders?

  2. Is there a specific order you want for plotting the x-axis and y-axis attributes?

  3. Would you prefer the x-axis to display discrete categories or a continuous range?

  4. Do you want a grid layout to be included for easier readability?

  5. Should the bubble sizes be proportional to the level of lung cancer risk on a
  linear or logarithmic scale?

  6. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would prefer to use?

  7. Do you have any preference regarding the size or dimensions of the chart for
  better clarity?

  8. How would you like the legend to be displayed, e.g., inside the chart area, to
  the right, or below it?

  9. Would you like to include data labels on the bubbles to display specific information,
  such as numerical values for Age or Air Pollution?

  10. Do you have any particular font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and
  legend?'
