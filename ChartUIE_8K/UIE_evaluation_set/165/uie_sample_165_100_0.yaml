initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the lung cancer prediction data. Highlight
  key variables like 'Age', 'Smoking', and 'Genetic Risk' to show their impact on
  cancer levels ('Low', 'Medium', 'High'). Use text annotations to describe values
  for specific data points, especially for those variables that show strong correlations.
  Highlight columns with unique data like 'Patient Id' and 'Level' for better differentiation.
  This will help in understanding how various factors contribute to the risk levels
  predicted for lung cancer. Include context on health focus from the dataset details.
questions: '1. Do you have a color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. What specific font style and size would you like for text annotations?

  3. Do you prefer to display numerical values within the heatmap cells?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradients for lung cancer
  levels?

  5. Do you want any specific sorting or ordering of the rows and columns?

  6. Is there a preference for the layout or positioning of the unique data columns
  such as ''Patient Id'' and ''Level''?

  7. Are there any specific axis titles or labels you would like to include?

  8. Do you have any specific preference for the annotation method for strong correlations?

  9. Should the context on health focus be included as a separate note or integrated
  within the heatmap itself?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer to display numerical values within the heatmap cells.

  4. Yes, include a legend to explain the color gradients for lung cancer levels.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. No specific axis titles or labels are needed.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Integrated within the heatmap itself.'
