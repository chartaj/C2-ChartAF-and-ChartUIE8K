initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the Lung Cancer Prediction
  data. The x-axis should represent the "Age" of the patients, and the y-axis should
  show the levels of "Air Pollution," "Alcohol use," and "Dust Allergy" across different
  ages. Use different colored lines for each of these three variables to make the
  chart clear and distinguishable. Additionally, indicate the "Level" (Low, Medium,
  High) of lung cancer risk on the chart, possibly with markers or labels at relevant
  points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the lines representing
  ''Air Pollution,'' ''Alcohol use,'' and ''Dust Allergy''?

  2. Would you prefer the ''Level'' of lung cancer risk to be indicated with specific
  marker shapes or text labels?

  3. Are there any specific age intervals or ranges you would like to highlight on
  the x-axis?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the chart for easier
  reading, or do you prefer a cleaner look?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart''s labels and title?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between the different colored
  lines? If so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  the chart?
