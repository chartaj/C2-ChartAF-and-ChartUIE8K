initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart that displays the historical and projected
  EV sales share by region and powertrain from 2010 to 2024. The x-axis should represent
  the years, and the y-axis should show the percentage of EV sales share. Different
  regions and powertrain types (like EV and BEV) should be color-coded to distinguish
  them. Ensure the data points for 'EV stock share', 'EV sales share', and 'EV sales'
  are accurately plotted and categorized. This will help us visualize the growth and
  trends in EV adoption globally and regionally over time. Use the dataset provided.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to distinguish
  different regions and powertrain types?

  2. Would you like any specific data labeling on the chart, such as data point markers
  or values displayed?

  3. Are there particular regions or powertrain types you want to be highlighted or
  emphasized more prominently?

  4. Do you have preferences for the style or format of the area fills (e.g., solid
  fills, gradients, transparency levels) within the stacked area chart?

  5. Should any specific annotations or markers be included to highlight key milestones
  or significant events in the timeline from 2010 to 2024?

  6. Would you prefer a particular order for stacking the areas (e.g., by region first,
  then by powertrain, or vice versa)?

  7. Do you require a specific layout for the legend (e.g., position and arrangement)
  to categorize regions and powertrain types effectively?

  8. Are there any specific font styles, sizes, or types for the axis labels and titles
  that you prefer?'
