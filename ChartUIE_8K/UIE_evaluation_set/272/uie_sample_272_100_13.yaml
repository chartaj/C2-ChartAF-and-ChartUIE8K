initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize EV market data from 2010
  to 2024. The chart should plot regions on the x-axis, years on the y-axis, and the
  size of the bubbles should represent the value of the EV sales. Different colors
  should be used to differentiate categories like 'EV stock share', 'EV sales share',
  and 'EV sales'. Ensure the powertrain type is indicated either through bubble labels
  or a legend. Please include units in the labels for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. What specific color palette would you prefer for differentiating ''EV
  stock share'', ''EV sales share'', and ''EV sales'' bubbles?

  2. Do you have a preference for the type of legend (discrete or continuous) to indicate
  the powertrain type?

  3. Which font style and size would you like for the axis labels, bubble labels,
  and legend text?

  4. How detailed should the unit labels be (e.g., full text like ''percent'' or abbreviations
  like ''%'')?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, should
  they be light or bold lines?

  6. Are there any specific regions or years you would prefer to be highlighted or
  annotated?

  7. Do you have a preference for the bubble size scaling method? For example, should
  it be linear or proportional?

  8. Would you like to include data points'' values within the bubbles, or should
  they only appear on hover/tooltip?

  9. Should the x-axis (regions) and y-axis (years) be sorted in a specific order
  or arranged alphabetically/chronologically?

  10. Is there a preferred title for the chart or a subtitle to provide additional
  context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color palette, please use one that clearly
  differentiates the categories.

  2. I do not know, please choose the type of legend that best indicates the powertrain
  type.

  3. I am not sure about the font style and size, please use one that is clear and
  readable.

  4. Full text like ''percent'' for unit labels would be great.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines. Light lines would be preferred for better readability.

  6. No specific regions or years need to be highlighted or annotated.

  7. I do not know, please choose the bubble size scaling method that best represents
  the data.

  8. I have no specific preference, please use your best judgment.

  9. Please arrange the x-axis and y-axis in a chronological order.

  10. A suitable title might be "EV Market Data: Regional Trends from 2010 to 2024".
  I do not have a preference for a subtitle.'
