initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of EV sales and
  stock share in Australia from 2010 to 2024. Use different colors for "EV stock share"
  and "EV sales share" under the "parameter" column. The x-axis should represent the
  years, and the y-axis should show the value in their respective units ("percent"
  for stock and sales share). Include a legend to differentiate between the two parameters,
  and ensure the plot clearly displays variance and distribution over the years. This
  will help quickly understand the trend and spread of EV adoption in Australia.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the "EV stock share"
  and "EV sales share" categories?

  2. Would you prefer a specific color palette for the overall chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or format for the legend?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like included on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to display data points or markers on the violin plot?

  7. Do you have preferences for the appearance of the violin plot (e.g., width, smoothing)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you would like to highlight on the
  y-axis?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the gridlines (e.g., color, style)?'
