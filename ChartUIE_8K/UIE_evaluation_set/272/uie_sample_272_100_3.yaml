initial_prompt: Please create a Treemap chart showing the distribution of EV stock
  share, EV sales share, and EV sales across different regions in 2011. Each rectangle
  should represent a different parameter, and the size should correspond to its value.
  The regions should be divided based on the mode (e.g., Cars) and powertrain type
  (e.g., EV, BEV). Use distinct colors for each category (e.g., Historical). The chart
  should clearly indicate the units of measurement (e.g., percent, Vehicles). The
  aim is to compare the adoption and sales of electric vehicles globally. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct categories (e.g.,
  Historical)?

  2. How would you like the legend to be displayed? Should it be inside or outside
  the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences (type, size) for labels and annotations?

  4. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the Treemap chart?

  5. Should the chart include tooltips or data labels for each rectangle to show precise
  values?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout for the Treemap chart (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  7. Are there any specific regions or categories that you would like to highlight
  or emphasize in the chart?

  8. How should the units of measurement (percent, Vehicles) be displayed? Would you
  prefer them in a legend, directly on the chart, or both?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you would like the regions, modes, or powertrain
  types to be arranged?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for titles or subtitles.

  5. Yes, the chart should include data labels for each rectangle to show precise
  values.

  6. I have no specific preference for the layout.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Units of measurement should be displayed both directly on the chart and in a
  legend.

  9. I do not have a specific order preference.'
