initial_prompt: 'Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the "Global EV Sales:
  2010-2024" dataset. The chart should display "region" on the x-axis, grouped by
  "year", and "value" on the y-axis, representing the total EV sales (in ''Vehicles'')
  and EV stock/sales share (in ''percent''). Different colors should be used for each
  "parameter" (''EV stock share'', ''EV sales share'', ''EV sales''). This will help
  compare the growth and share of electric vehicles across different regions and years.
  Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different parameters
  (''EV stock share'', ''EV sales share'', ''EV sales'')?

  2. What level of granularity do you prefer for the x-axis labels (e.g., all regions
  displayed, grouped, or filtered by certain criteria)?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the bars for easier reading of the values?

  4. Are there any specific regions you would like to highlight or focus on in the
  chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the ordering of the regions along the x-axis?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between the different parameters?
  If so, where would you prefer the legend to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Are there any specific years or a range of years you want to focus on within
  the dataset?

  9. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to indicate important
  thresholds or average values on the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart title or axis labels?'
