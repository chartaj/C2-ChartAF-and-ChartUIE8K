initial_prompt: 'I need a radar chart to visualize the global EV sales data. Referring
  to the data from "Global EV Sales: 2010-2024," I want to compare different regions
  (like Australia) across various parameters such as ''EV stock share'', ''EV sales
  share'', and ''EV sales''. Highlight the differences in ''powertrain'' categories
  (EV, BEV) over the years from 2010 to 2024. Display the values in appropriate units
  (percent, Vehicles). Ensure the chart is easy to interpret with clear labels for
  each axis and a legend to differentiate the modes and powertrains.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the different regions or
  powertrain categories?

  2. How many regions would you like to include in the radar chart?

  3. Would you like the chart to emphasize any particular regions or years more prominently?

  4. Is there any specific order you want for the regions or powertrain categories
  on the radar chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the size or style of the labels on each axis?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or additional information on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font or style for the legend and labels?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the radar
  chart?

  9. Do you want to highlight any specific years or data points within the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, any clear and distinguishable color scheme will work.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe around 5-7 key regions.

  3. I do not know, just represent all the years equally.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure, perhaps "Global EV Sales Comparison: 2010-2024".

  9. I am not sure.'
