initial_prompt: I would like to create an area chart visualizing the global EV sales
  from 2010 to 2024, separated by region, powertrain, and mode. The x-axis should
  represent the years from 2010 to 2024, while the y-axis will show the number of
  EV sales in vehicles. Each region should have a different color with opacity, and
  the chart should be stacked to illustrate the cumulative growth of EV sales over
  the years. Include data labels for the values in the last year (2024) for better
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent different
  regions?

  2. What level of opacity would you prefer for the regions to ensure clarity without
  cluttering the chart?

  3. How would you like the powertrain and mode categories to be represented within
  each region: different shades, patterns, or a different approach?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size of the data labels
  for the values in 2024?

  5. Would you like grid lines included on the chart for better readability, and if
  so, in what style?

  6. Do you prefer a specific order for stacking the regions, powertrains, and modes
  on the chart?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or markings you would like to include to
  highlight specific trends or milestones?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  9. Do you have a preferred format for the number of EV sales (e.g., with commas,
  precise decimals)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for colors.

  2. I am not sure about the level of opacity.

  3. I am not sure about how to represent powertrain and mode categories.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. I do not know about grid lines.

  6. I do not have a preference for the stacking order.

  7. I do not know about additional annotations or markings.

  8. Yes, I would like a legend included, but I am not sure where it should be positioned.

  9. With commas, please.'
