initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart showing the EV sales share (%) versus EV stock
  share (%) for different regions in the year 2011. Use bubble size to represent the
  number of EV sales (Vehicles). Use different colors to distinguish between various
  powertrains.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for different
  powertrains?

  2. What level of detail would you prefer for the axis labels (for example, specific
  units or decimal places)?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their appearance?

  4. Do you want data labels on the bubbles to represent specific values like region
  names or numerical values?

  5. How would you prefer to handle overlapping bubbles â€“ should there be opacity
  settings or perhaps a jittered layout?

  6. Is there a specific order or legend format you would prefer for the powertrains?

  7. Would you like any specific markers or annotations for highlighting certain data
  points or regions?

  8. Do you have a preference for the bubble size range to ensure better visibility
  and differentiation?'
