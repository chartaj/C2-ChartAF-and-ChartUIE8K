initial_prompt: I need a Choropleth map to visualize global EV sales and stock data
  from 2010 to 2024. Highlight regions by EV stock share, EV sales share, and EV sales,
  using different colors for each metric. Ensure each region's data is clearly differentiated
  by year and powertrain type. Use "percent" and "Vehicles" units where applicable.
  The map should provide an easy-to-understand visual representation of the distribution
  and trends of electric vehicle adoption over the years. Include a legend to interpret
  the colors and differentiate between historical, current, and projected data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between EV
  stock share, EV sales share, and EV sales?

  2. How would you like the data differentiated between historical, current, and projected
  data in the legend?

  3. Would you prefer specific color hues or gradients for each metric?

  4. Are there any specific map projections (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) you would like
  the choropleth map to use?

  5. Should the map include any specific annotations or markers for significant data
  points?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the style and size of the legend?

  7. Would you like to include any tooltips for additional information when hovering
  over a region?

  8. How would you prefer to represent the units "percent" and "Vehicles" visually
  on the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Differentiate them clearly, maybe with distinct patterns or shades.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No specific preference for the style and size of the legend.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Use "percent" for EV stock share and EV sales share, and "Vehicles" for EV sales.'
