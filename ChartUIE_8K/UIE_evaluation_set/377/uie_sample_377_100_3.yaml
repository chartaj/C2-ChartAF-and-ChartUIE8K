initial_prompt: 'I need a Choropleth map displaying the election results by constituency
  from the given data. The map should color-code each area based on the winning party:
  Conservative (CON), Labour (LAB), Liberal (LIB), etc. Additionally, provide a legend
  that indicates the winning party''s percentage of the total vote in each constituency.

  in understanding the political landscape across different regions.'
