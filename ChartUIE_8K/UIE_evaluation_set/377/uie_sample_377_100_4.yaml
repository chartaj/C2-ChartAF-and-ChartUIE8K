initial_prompt: Please create a box chart that visualizes the distribution of percentages
  for each political party (CON(%), LAB(%), LIB(%), Brexit(%), Green(%), NAT(%), MIN(%),
  OTH(%)) across constituencies. I want to see the range, quartiles, and median values
  for the percentage shares of votes for each party. This will help understand the
  spread and central tendencies of vote percentages. Ensure that the chart clearly
  labels each party on the x-axis and percentage values on the y-axis. The chart should
  be easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to display individual data points within the box plots?

  3. Should there be any annotations or additional labels on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preferred orientation for the x-axis labels (horizontal, vertical,
  angled)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or key for the chart?

  6. Is there a specific order in which the parties should appear on the x-axis?

  7. Are there any specific highlights or emphasis you would like on certain quartiles
  or ranges?'
