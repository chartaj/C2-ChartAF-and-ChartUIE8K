initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the percentage shares of votes across
  different parties (CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, OTH) for each constituency. The
  constituencies will be the rows, and the parties will be the columns. Color intensity
  should represent the percentage of votes each party received in that constituency.
  This visualization will help compare the distribution of votes and identify patterns
  or strongholds for each party across different regions. Ensure to label axes clearly
  and provide a legend for percentage values. This heatmap will support political
  analysis and electoral strategy planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palettes or themes in mind for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or highlights for certain
  constituencies or parties?

  3. How detailed would you prefer the legend to be? Should it include specific percentage
  ranges?

  4. Do you prefer a specific ordering for the constituencies (e.g., alphabetical,
  by region, by party dominance)?

  5. Are there any particular labeling preferences for the axes (font size, font type,
  angle)?

  6. Would you like the percentage values to be displayed directly on the heatmap
  cells, or should they only be represented by color intensity?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., horizontal, vertical)?

  8. Are there any specific patterns or strongholds you would like to emphasize in
  the heatmap?'
