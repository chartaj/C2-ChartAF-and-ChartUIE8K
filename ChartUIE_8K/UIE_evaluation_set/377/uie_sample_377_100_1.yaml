initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the election data. Plot "Electorate"
  on the x-axis and "CON(%)", "LAB(%)", and "LIB(%)" on the y-axis for different MPs.
  Highlight the winning party in each constituency using different colors. Add annotations
  for key constituencies such as 'Aldershot', 'Aldridge-Brownhills', and 'Altrincham
  and Sale West' to show values and winning party. The purpose is to explore voting
  distribution across counties and identify patterns in voter preferences and party
  dominance. The context is political analysis during elections.
