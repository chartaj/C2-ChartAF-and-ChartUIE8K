initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the data from the CSV file located
  at '../Extra_datas/data/496.csv'. Plot 'x1' on the x-axis and 'y' on the y-axis.
  Use another scatter plot for 'x2' on the x-axis and 'y' on the y-axis. Since there
  are no missing values and the data types are uniform float64, please ensure the
  scatter plot points are clearly legible and differentiated by color or marker. Include
  appropriate axis labels and a legend to distinguish between the two scatter plots
  ('x1 vs y' and 'x2 vs y').
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the scatter
  plots?

  2. Do you have a preference for the shape of markers used in the scatter plots?

  3. How would you like the size of the markers to be set? (e.g., fixed size, variable
  size based on data)

  4. Are there specific titles or annotations you would like to include on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plots? If so, any specific
  style preferences?

  7. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific threshold lines or reference lines you want included on
  the scatter plots?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the shape of markers used in the scatter plots.

  3. Fixed size markers would be fine.

  4. No, I do not have specific titles or annotations to include on the chart.

  5. I do not have a preference for the font style or size.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines, but I do not have a specific style preference.

  7. I do not know; the default position is fine.

  8. No, I do not want any specific threshold lines or reference lines on the scatter
  plots.'
