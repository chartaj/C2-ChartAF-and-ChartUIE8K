initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the provided dataset columns (y, x1, and x2).
  Ensure to highlight key data points to draw attention to significant values. Annotate
  specific data points within the heatmap that are of particular interest, indicating
  their precise values to the viewer. The purpose is to visualize and identify patterns
  or trends in the data, making it easier to analyze relationships between variables.
  This visualization will be a useful tool for data science and analytics tasks, emphasizing
  important elements through visual differentiations such as color and size modifications.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color gradient focus on specific value ranges or anomalies?

  3. Are there particular data points or ranges that you want to emphasize with annotations?

  4. How would you like the annotations to be formatted or styled?

  5. Do you prefer any specific size or resolution for the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to add any labels or titles for the axes and the heatmap itself?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like significant values to be highlighted (e.g.,
  bold, italics, larger size)?

  8. Are there any gridlines or borders preferences for the heatmap cells?

  9. Would you like a legend to explain the color gradients or any other elements?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, it would be good if the color gradient can focus on specific value ranges
  or anomalies.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I don''t have a specific size or resolution in mind.

  6. Yes, please add labels for the y-axis, x1-axis, and x2-axis, and a title for
  the heatmap.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any preference.

  9. Yes, a legend would be helpful to explain the color gradients.
