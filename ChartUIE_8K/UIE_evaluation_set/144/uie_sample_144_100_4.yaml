initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart visualizing the number of housing
  units, people left homeless, and minors left homeless across different localities
  and districts of the West Bank from the data file. The chart should display groups
  for each locality, with bars representing housing units, people left homeless, and
  minors left homeless. This will help us understand the impact of demolitions in
  various areas. Use different colors for each bar category to distinguish between
  them. Include a legend and appropriate titles for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the colors representing ''housing units'', ''people
  left homeless'', and ''minors left homeless''?

  3. Is there a specific ordering for each locality or district you would prefer?

  4. Do you want data values to be displayed on top of each bar?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the chart labels
  and titles?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be
  for both axes or just one?

  8. Would you prefer any specific style for the legend placement?

  9. Do you want to include any additional information, such as annotations or notes,
  to explain certain data points?'
