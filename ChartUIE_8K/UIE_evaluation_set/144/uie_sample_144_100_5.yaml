initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the data on Palestinian structures
  demolished by Israel. Plot each demolition event with the date of demolition on
  the x-axis and the number of housing units demolished on the y-axis. Differentiate
  the points using the type of structure (Residential vs. Non-Residential) with distinct
  colors. Additionally, use shape variations to represent the reasons for demolition.
  Ensure the plot includes a legend for easy interpretation. This visualization will
  help to identify patterns and trends in demolitions over time.

  and Non-Residential structures?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines to be shown or hidden on the scatter plot?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitle? If so, please specify
  the text.

  8. Are there any additional contextual details you would like to add to the chart
  for better understanding?

  9. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend on the chart?'
