initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the data on Palestinian structures demolished
  by Israel. The heatmap should highlight the number of demolitions by district and
  reason for demolition. Annotations should describe trends or interesting points,
  such as districts with the highest demolitions or common reasons. Use color gradients
  to show varying frequencies of demolitions. The chart's purpose is to provide an
  insightful visual representation of the impact of demolitions across different districts
  for policy discussions and humanitarian aid planning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  3. Should we display the exact number of demolitions within each heatmap cell?

  4. Do you have any specific trends or points that you would like to be highlighted
  in the annotations?

  5. Is there a particular ordering of districts or reasons for demolition that you
  prefer?

  6. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitles on the heatmap? If so, do
  you have specific wording in mind?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for annotations and labels?

  8. Do you have a preferred range for the color gradient to highlight varying frequencies?

  9. Should we include any additional contextual information, like a description or
  summary, around the heatmap?'
