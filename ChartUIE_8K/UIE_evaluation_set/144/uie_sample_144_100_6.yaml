initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the data on demolitions of Palestinian
  structures by Israel. Specifically, I want the x-axis to display the "date_of_demolition"
  and the y-axis to show the number of "housing_units" demolished. The chart should
  also highlight categories like "type_of_sturcture" (residential vs non-residential)
  and "reason_for_demolition" with distinct colors or markers. Including trends over
  time for different localities and districts would also be helpful. Use the unique
  values and other summary statistics to ensure the chart captures significant trends
  and anomalies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting different categories
  such as ''type_of_sturcture'' and ''reason_for_demolition''?

  2. Would you like to see separate trend lines for each locality and district, or
  should they be shown as a combined overall trend?

  3. How would you prefer the anomalies or significant trends to be highlighted? (e.g.,
  different markers, colors, or annotations)

  4. Do you need specific labels or legends for each category and trend line?

  5. Is there a particular date range you want to focus on, or should the entire dataset
  be displayed?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or appearance of the line
  chart (e.g., line thickness, dashed vs. solid lines)?

  7. Would you like to include summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) directly on
  the chart?

  8. Do you require grid lines or any other background features for easier readability?

  9. Should the y-axis be fixed at a certain scale, or should it adjust dynamically
  based on the data?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart for context?'
