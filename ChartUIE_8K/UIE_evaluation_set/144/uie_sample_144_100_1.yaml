initial_prompt: Create a Geographic Heatmap to visualize the data on Palestinian structures
  demolished by Israel. Use locality and district to pinpoint locations across the
  West Bank. Highlight areas with higher counts of housing units demolished and people
  left homeless. Annotate significant data points to draw attention to locations with
  the highest impact. The heatmap should provide clear visual cues for understanding
  the geographic distribution and reasons for demolitions. This will help in contextualizing
  the political and social implications behind the demolitions. Keep the visualization
  concise and focused on displaying the critical issues highlighted by the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap to represent different
  ranges of demolitions?

  2. Would you like to include specific icons or symbols to annotate significant data
  points?

  3. What level of detail do you want in the annotations for significant data points
  (e.g., just name and number, or more detailed information)?

  4. Are there any specific regions or locales you want to highlight or focus on in
  the map?

  5. Do you prefer a specific map style or background (e.g., satellite, terrain, minimalistic)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradients and symbols
  used in the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include a time filter to see demolitions over specific periods?

  8. Would you like a summary box with key statistics displayed on the map?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  10. Do you want the heatmap to show borders or markers for different districts clearly?'
