initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart comparing the number of squirrels exhibiting
  different behaviors (running, chasing, climbing, eating, foraging, etc.). Use the
  NYC squirrel data and show the count for each behavior. Include the squirrel age
  (Adult, Juvenile, etc.) as a category to see if there's a difference in behavior
  across ages. Make sure the chart is labeled clearly and also include a legend to
  differentiate between Adult and Juvenile squirrels. Thank you.
