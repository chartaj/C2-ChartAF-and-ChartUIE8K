initial_prompt: I need a histogram to show the distribution of different primary fur
  colors of squirrels observed in NYC. The histogram should have primary fur colors
  on the x-axis and the count of squirrels on the y-axis. Include sections for "Gray,"
  "Cinnamon," and any other fur colors recorded. Additionally, please note any missing
  data in the chart. This visualization will help in understanding the prevalence
  of different squirrel fur colors in various boroughs. Make sure the chart is clear
  and labeled properly for easy interpretation. Thanks!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for different sections of the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include a legend indicating the different fur colors?

  4. Should the x-axis have a specific ordering for the fur colors, or should it be
  alphabetical?

  5. Do you prefer any particular style or format for the axis labels?

  6. How would you like missing data to be annotated on the chart?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size that you prefer for the labels and title?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the histogram for easier interpretation of values?

  9. Would you like any annotations or callouts to highlight significant data points
  or trends?

  10. Do you need any specific dimensions or aspect ratio for the histogram?'
