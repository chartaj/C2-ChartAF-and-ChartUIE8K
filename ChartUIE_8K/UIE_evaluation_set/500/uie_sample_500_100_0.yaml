initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the counts of different primary
  fur colors of squirrels observed, broken down by age. Highlight squirrels with the
  combination of 'Gray+Cinnamon' fur color. Use text annotations to highlight values
  in each segment and visualize trends in the fur color distribution among age groups.
  This will help us understand the distribution of squirrel fur colors within different
  age groups, informing zoology research on the squirrel population in NYC. Ensure
  all chart elements are clearly labeled for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the highlighted ''Gray+Cinnamon'' squirrels to be visually
  distinguished?

  3. Should the text annotations display absolute counts, percentages, or both within
  each segment?

  4. Do you require any specific labels for the X and Y axes?

  5. Is there a specific ordering you prefer for the age groups on the X-axis?

  6. Do you want a legend included for the primary fur colors?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you want for the chart elements (titles,
  labels, annotations)?

  8. Should we include any grid lines or background elements to enhance readability?

  9. Do you have any requirements for the chart''s title or any additional text descriptions?'
