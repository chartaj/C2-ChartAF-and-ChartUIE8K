initial_prompt: I have a dataset on squirrel sightings in NYC with geographic coordinates
  (latitude and longitude) and various squirrel behaviors. I envision a geographic
  heatmap of NYC showing the density of squirrel sightings. Different colors could
  represent the concentration of sightings, possibly segregated by primary fur color.
  We should also plot interactive points, where clicking a point reveals additional
  data such as specific squirrel behaviors observed at that location. This heatmap
  will help visualize where squirrels are most commonly found and highlight behavioral
  patterns. Can you create this map?
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for representing the
  concentrations of squirrel sightings?

  2. How many color gradients would you prefer for indicating density levels on the
  heatmap?

  3. Would you like the primary fur color to be represented with specific colors on
  the map?

  4. Do you prefer any specific map styles or basemaps (e.g., satellite view, street
  map, terrain map)?

  5. Is there a particular size or shape you prefer for the interactive points on
  the map?

  6. Should the visualization include any labels or legends, and if so, do you have
  a preference for how they should be styled?

  7. Are there any specific geographic boundaries (e.g., neighborhoods, boroughs)
  you would like highlighted or overlaid on the map?

  8. Is there any other contextual information or data layers you would like to include
  on the map for better reference?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the display of the map, such as initial zoom
  level or center position?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I would like the primary fur color to be represented with specific colors
  on the map.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, the visualization should include labels or legends, but I have no specific
  preference for their style.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
