initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the NYC squirrel data to visualize the daily
  sightings. The x-axis should represent the dates, formatted as MM/DD/YYYY, and the
  y-axis should show the number of squirrels sighted per day. Highlight key dates
  with significantly higher sightings using text annotations to indicate the exact
  count. Use different line colors to distinguish shifts (AM/PM). This visualization
  will help zoologists understand activity patterns and behaviors. Add highlights
  on specific dates where unusual activity was observed and provide brief contextual
  annotations. Keep it clear and focused on trends over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. How would you like key dates with significantly higher sightings to be highlighted?
  (e.g., specific color, bold text, larger annotations)

  3. Do you have a specific style or font preference for the annotations?

  4. Would you like the AM/PM shifts to be represented by specific line styles in
  addition to different colors? (e.g., dashed for AM, solid for PM)

  5. Are there any specific dates that you already know should be highlighted?

  6. Do you prefer any specific format for the title and axes labels?

  7. How much contextual information should the annotations include for unusual activities?
  (e.g., brief notes, detailed descriptions)

  8. Are there any additional elements you want to include in the visualization, such
  as a legend or a grid?

  9. Do you have any size or aspect ratio preferences for the chart?

  10. Would you like to include markers (e.g., dots, squares) on the lines to represent
  individual data points?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.
