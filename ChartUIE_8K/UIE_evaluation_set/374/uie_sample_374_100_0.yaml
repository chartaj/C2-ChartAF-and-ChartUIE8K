initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the satisfaction levels for two products.
  Use different colors for each product to distinguish them. Highlight the extreme
  satisfaction scores using annotations to help focus on these key points. Additionally,
  add text annotations to display the values of notable peaks in the histogram. The
  visualization should help business stakeholders quickly grasp areas of high satisfaction
  or dissatisfaction, aiding decisions for improvements. Place the product type and
  value on the axes appropriately. Ensure to provide context around why specific elements
  are highlighted and annotated.

  products?

  2. Should the extreme satisfaction scores be highlighted in a particular color or
  style?

  3. Do you prefer any specific format for the text annotations displaying notable

  4. Is there a particular range or criteria for what you consider ''extreme'' satisfaction
  scores?

  5. Would you like the histogram bars to have a specific width or spacing?

  6. Should the legend include specific titles or details about the products?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in which
  style?

  8. Is there a preferred positioning for annotations on the chart (e.g., above bars,
  below bars, side of bars)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart title or subtitle?

  10. Should additional context or insights be provided in the form of a caption or
  footnote?'
