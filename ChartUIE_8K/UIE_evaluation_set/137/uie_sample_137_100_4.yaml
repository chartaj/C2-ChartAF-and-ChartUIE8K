initial_prompt: I would like to see a scatter plot for the Heart Failure Prediction
  Dataset. On the x-axis, please plot 'Age', and on the y-axis, plot 'Cholesterol'.
  Use different colors to indicate 'HeartDisease' status and different shapes or markers
  to represent 'Sex'. This will help visualize any trends or correlations between
  age, cholesterol levels, and heart disease, and how these patterns might differ
  between males and females. The plot should be clear and include a legend for 'Sex'
  and 'HeartDisease'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing the ''HeartDisease''
  status?

  2. Are there specific marker shapes you would like to use to represent different
  ''Sex'' categories?

  4. Do you prefer grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  5. Should the plot include a trend line or regression line to visualize the correlation
  more clearly?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels'' format or style?'
