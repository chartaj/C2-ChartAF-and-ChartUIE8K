initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the "Heart Failure Prediction Dataset,"
  focusing on health metrics. Specifically, I want box plots for age, resting blood
  pressure, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate to see data distribution. Use different
  colors to differentiate groups with and without heart disease. Include labels, axis
  titles, and a legend for clarity. Show any outliers distinctly. This visualization
  will help discern patterns or anomalies in critical health indicators for patients
  with and without heart disease. Make sure the chart is clean and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  groups with and without heart disease?

  2. What title would you like to give to the overall chart?

  3. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the labels and axis titles?

  4. Would you like the outliers to be highlighted in a specific way or with specific
  colors?

  5. Is there a specific ordering you prefer for the box plots (e.g., Age first, then
  RestingBP, etc.)?

  6. Do you need any specific annotations or notes on the chart for clarity?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend''s position on the chart
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the axis titles (e.g., "Age
  (years)" or just "Age")?

  9. Should any grid lines be included or excluded in the chart for better readability?

  10. Do you have a preferred format for numbering on the axes (e.g., two decimal
  places, no decimals)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I would like the outliers to be highlighted distinctly, maybe in red or another
  noticeable color.

  5. Age first, then Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, and Maximum Heart Rate.

  6. I do not have any specific annotations or notes in mind.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. "Age (years)", "Resting Blood Pressure (mm Hg)", "Cholesterol (mg/dL)", "Maximum
  Heart Rate (bpm)"

  9. I do not know.

  10. No specific preference, but no decimals should be fine.'
