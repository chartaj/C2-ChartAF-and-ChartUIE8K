initial_prompt: Create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of 'ChestPainType'
  from the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. The chart should display the proportion
  of each unique ChestPainType (ATA, NAP, etc.) as a percentage of the whole. Include
  labels for each segment and a legend that matches the colors in the pie chart for
  easy reference. Also, ensure that the title of the chart clearly indicates it represents
  the 'Distribution of Chest Pain Types among Patients'. This pie chart will help
  us quickly understand the prevalence of different types of chest pain in the dataset.
