initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the age distribution of individuals
  in the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset. Highlight the age range where heart disease
  is prevalent using a different color. Use text annotations to display the exact
  count of individuals within specific age intervals, emphasizing the significance
  of those values. Make sure to include labels for the x-axis (Age) and y-axis (Count).
  Since the context is health-related, this chart helps in identifying the age groups
  most at risk for heart disease, guiding preventive measures and resource allocation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How would you like the prevalent age range for heart disease to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific color, shading)?

  3. What specific age intervals would you like for text annotations?

  4. Do you prefer a certain font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the different colors used in the histogram?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for easier interpretation?

  7. Are there any specific axis label formats or units you prefer?

  8. Would you prefer the bar widths to be of a certain size or automatically adjusted
  based on the data?

  9. Do you want to display any additional statistical information (e.g., mean age,
  median age) on the histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Specific color would be good.

  3. I do not know, maybe standard age intervals like 10 years.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Automatically adjusted based on the data.

  9. I am not sure.'
