initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset.
  Use the 'HeartDisease' column to show the count of heart disease cases (1) versus
  non-cases (0). Highlight bars to emphasize the difference in counts. Add text annotations
  to display exact counts on the bars. This will help in identifying the prevalence
  of heart disease in the dataset quickly. Use color for highlights to make it visually
  distinct. This practical chart will assist health professionals in understanding
  the distribution of heart disease incidence in the patient sample.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the differences
  between the bars?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for the bars representing cases (1)
  and non-cases (0) of heart disease?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations
  displaying exact counts?

  4. Would you like any additional labels or titles on the chart, such as an overall
  title or axis titles?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the bars to be displayed, such
  as heart disease cases first or non-cases first?

  6. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like included to explain colors
  or categories in the chart?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in
  what style?

  8. Is there a particular format or style for the axes values (e.g., percentage format,
  numerical format)?'
