initial_prompt: I have a dataset about heart failure prediction. Can you help me create
  a line chart using the provided data? Specifically, I would like to visualize the
  trend of MaxHR (maximum heart rate) across different ages for both males and females.
  Additionally, it would be great to differentiate between those who have heart disease
  and those who do not. This will help me understand how heart rate varies with age
  and gender in relation to heart failure. Please make sure the line chart is clear
  and includes legends for gender and heart disease status. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating genders?

  2. Do you have a preferred color for distinguishing the presence or absence of heart
  disease?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled?

  4. Do you have a specific title for the chart in mind?

  5. What level of gridline detail do you prefer on the chart (e.g.,_major gridlines,
  minor gridlines)?

  6. Would you like any specific data points to be highlighted?

  7. Is there a particular font style and size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  8. Do you prefer straight or smoothed lines in the line chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. MaxHR on the y-axis and Age on the x-axis.

  4. Heart Rate Trends by Age, Gender, and Heart Disease Status.

  5. Major gridlines.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Smoothed lines.'
