initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot comparing grain weight (GW) of two genotypes
  (CV1 and CV2) in wheat farming. Plot CV1's GW on the x-axis and CV2's GW. Highlight
  trends.
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors to differentiate the two genotypes on
  the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better reference?

  3. Should there be any annotations or labels for specific data points on the chart?

  4. Do you want a trend line to be included on the scatter plot?

  5. Are there any specific axis labels or titles that you prefer for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  6. Do you have a specific range for the x-axis and y-axis values?

  7. Would you like any additional statistical information displayed on the chart
  (e.g., correlation coefficient)?

  8. Are there any specific markers or symbols you prefer for the data points representing
  CV1 and CV2?

  9. Should there be a legend included on the chart, and if so, do you have a preference
  for its placement?

  10. Do you want to include a title for the scatter plot, and if yes, what should
  it be?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please include a trend line.

  5. X-axis: Grain Weight of CV1, Y-axis: Grain Weight of CV2

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Yes, please include a legend. I do not have a preference for its placement.
