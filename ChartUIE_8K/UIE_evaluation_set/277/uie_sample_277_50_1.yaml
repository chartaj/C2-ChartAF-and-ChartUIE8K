initial_prompt: Chart the grain weights (GW, GW.1) for genotypes CV1 and CV2 using
  a stacked column chart. Highlight specific data points and add text annotations
  for notable values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns representing
  CV1 and CV2?

  2. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between CV1 and CV2 grain weights?

  5. Are there any specific values or ranges you want to be highlighted in the chart?

  6. Should the axes have specific labels or titles?

  7. Do you require any specific format for the data labels on the columns (e.g.,
  exact values, rounded numbers)?

  8. Would you prefer the notable values to be annotated inside the columns or outside?
