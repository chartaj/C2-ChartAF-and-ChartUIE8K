initial_prompt: I need a box plot comparing the grain weight (GW) of two genotypes
  (CV1 and CV2) of wheat. Highlight the critical data points and include annotations
  for the key values to emphasize significant differences between the two genotypes.
  Ensure that missing values are accounted for properly. The purpose of this visualization
  is to assist in agricultural analysis by showcasing the variability and distribution
  of grain weight across the two genotypes. This will help draw attention to potential
  areas of improvement for wheat cultivation strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plot?

  2. Would you like the box plot to have a specific title or subtitle?

  3. Are there any specific annotations you would like to include for the key values?

  4. How would you prefer to highlight the critical data points (e.g., different color,
  shape, size)?

  5. Should the box plot include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer having outliers visibly marked in the box plot?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the annotations or highlights?

  8. Is there a specific layout or orientation (vertical or horizontal) you prefer
  for the box plot?

  9. Do you want to include the interquartile range (IQR) in the visualization?

  10. Are there any specific labels or axis titles you want to include or customize?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include annotations for the median, first quartile, and third quartile
  for both genotypes.

  4. Different color would be preferable to highlight critical data points.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be good for better readability.

  6. Yes, outliers should be visibly marked.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the annotations or highlights.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, include the interquartile range (IQR) in the visualization.

  10. Axis titles labeled as "Grain Weight (GW)" for the y-axis and "Genotype" for
  the x-axis.'
