initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare grain weights (GW) between two
  genotypes (CV1, CV2). Highlight and annotate significant values and differences
  to emphasize trends in agricultural performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing each
  genotype?

  2. Would you like specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the annotations and labels?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like the significant values and differences
  to be highlighted (e.g., different bar colors, bold text, special markers)?

  5. Do you need a legend to accompany the chart to distinguish between the two genotypes?

  6. How would you like the significant differences to be annotated (e.g., arrows,
  text boxes, star symbols)?

  7. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines to improve readability of the data?

  9. Do you have a specific format for the titles and subtitles that should be used
  on the chart?'
