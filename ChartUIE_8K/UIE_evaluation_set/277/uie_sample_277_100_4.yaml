initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the wheat grain weight across
  two genotypes, CV1 and CV2, over different growth weeks. Plot GW for CV1 and GW.1
  for CV2 on the Y-axis against the index of data points on the X-axis. Make sure
  to label the axes clearly, use different colors for each genotype line, and include
  a legend. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer for the genotype lines?

  2. What titles would you like for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  3. Would you like gridlines included on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the legend?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for the line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  genotype?

  7. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines, and if so, do you have
  a preference for the marker style (circle, square, triangle)?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text elements
  on the chart?

  9. Should the chart include annotations for certain data points?

  10. Do you want any specific background color for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. X-axis: Weeks, Y-axis: Grain Weight (GW)

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Wheat Grain Weight Across Different Genotypes Over Time

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, data points should be marked. I do not have a preference for the marker
  style.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I don''t know.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
