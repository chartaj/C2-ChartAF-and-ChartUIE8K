initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing park attendance in various boroughs of
  New York City for different sports activities each week. I'd like a geographic heatmap
  that displays the total attendance across different boroughs like Queens, Brooklyn,
  etc. This heatmap should highlight which boroughs have the highest and lowest attendance
  figures. Please ensure the color gradient accurately represents attendance density,
  helping identify hotspots. Utilize the attendance data from each day of the week
  and compile it to show overall trends. This visualization will help in understanding
  and planning for high-demand areas in sports and recreation.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color gradient for the heatmap to represent
  the attendance density?

  2. Would you like to include borough names or labels directly on the heatmap?

  3. Do you have any preference for the geographic boundaries or map style (e.g.,
  terrain, satellite, simple)?

  4. Are there any specific Boroughs you want highlighted or emphasized in the visualization?

  5. Would you like to add a legend to explain the color gradient representing attendance
  density?

  6. Do you have any specific size requirements or aspect ratio for the map?

  7. Would you like to include data labels for attendance numbers on the heatmap for
  each borough?

  8. Do you prefer the heatmap to show a weekly aggregate or a daily breakdown of
  attendance?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers youâ€™d like to include on the
  map?'
