initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the attendance distribution
  for each weekday across different weeks at Playground for All Children in Queens.
  The chart should highlight how the attendance varies for different sports played
  during the "Summer Sports Experience." Include data points for Sundays through Saturdays,
  and use the attendance numbers to showcase the range and median values for each
  day. This will help us understand patterns in weekly attendance and identify peak
  days. Ensure the chart labels are clear for easy interpretation by community members
  and event organizers. Thank you!
