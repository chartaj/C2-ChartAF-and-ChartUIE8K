initial_prompt: Visualize the attendance data as a heatmap to show the intensity of
  park visits across different days and sports played in Queens. Highlight the cells
  based on attendance numbers to easily spot high and low activity periods. Use text
  annotations on the highest attendance days to draw attention. Set unique colors
  for different sports to see patterns or preferences. Include weekly totals for quick
  comparisons. This will help understand park utilization for sports and plan future
  events or resource allocations based on attendance trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the text annotations on the highest
  attendance days?

  3. How would you like the weekly totals to be displayed (e.g., bold font, separate
  row/column)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular layout or ordering for the sports categories in
  the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include or emphasize?

  6. How do you want low attendance periods to be visually distinguished from high
  attendance periods (e.g., color gradient, threshold lines)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or ticks for days of the week
  and sports categories?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette preference for the heatmap.

  2. I do not know about the specific font style, but a medium size (around 12-14pt)
  for the text annotations would be good.

  3. I would like the weekly totals to be displayed in a bold font and perhaps in
  a separate row/column.

  4. I have no specific preference for the layout or ordering of the sports categories.

  5. I do not have any specific labels or legends that need emphasis.

  6. I am not sure how to visually distinguish low attendance periods from high attendance
  periods, maybe a color gradient?

  7. I have no specific preference for the axis labels or ticks for days of the week
  and sports categories.'
