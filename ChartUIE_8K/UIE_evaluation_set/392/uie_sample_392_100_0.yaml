initial_prompt: Create a Sankey diagram highlighting energy flow from different sources
  like Coal, Natural Gas, and Nuclear to various sectors. Use data-driven text annotations
  for significant values to focus the viewer's attention. Ensure the diagram highlights
  the most crucial flows by modifying the appearance of elements. This visualization
  aims to simplify understanding of energy distribution, spotlighting key transitions
  and missing connections. Include non-data-driven annotations for context and editorial
  insights. Emphasize differences between sources and targets to clarify energy distribution
  patterns and assist in energy management analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the Sankey diagram?

  2. Are there specific fonts or styles you''d like to see for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like significant values to be highlighted (e.g., bold text, different
  color, larger size)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific shapes or styles for the nodes and connectors (e.g.,
  rounded, straight lines)?

  5. Is there a preferred layout or orientation for the diagram (e.g., left-to-right,
  top-to-bottom)?

  6. Would you like to include legends or a key to help explain the visual elements
  of the diagram?

  7. Are there specific editorial insights or contextual information you want to ensure
  is included in the non-data-driven annotations?

  8. Do you have preferences for the appearance of elements to highlight crucial flows
  (e.g., thicker lines, brighter colors)?'
