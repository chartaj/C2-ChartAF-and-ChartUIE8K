initial_prompt: Create a network graph to visualize energy flow from sources to sectors.
  Use nodes to represent each energy type (e.g., Coal, NaturalGas, Nuclear) and lines
  to show connections. Highlight key nodes and connections using different colors
  or sizes. Annotate specific nodes with data values for context. This chart aims
  to illustrate the relationships and dependencies between energy sources and their
  respective sectors, emphasizing critical elements for easier comprehension. Add
  non-data-driven annotations for additional insights. Ensure the chart is straightforward
  and informative, focusing on essential flow pathways and values where data is available.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for different energy types and
  connections?

  2. How would you prefer the key nodes to be highlighted? (e.g., larger size, different
  shape, different color)

  3. Are there particular data values you want to be annotated for certain nodes?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels or legends for easy identification
  of nodes and connections?

  5. Do you have any preference for the layout of the network graph, such as hierarchical,
  circular, or force-directed?

  6. Are there any specific non-data-driven annotations or insights you would like
  to include in the chart?

  7. Do you prefer any specific fonts and styles for the annotations and labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different color and larger size would be great.

  3. Yes, annotate the data values for Coal, NaturalGas, and Nuclear nodes.

  4. Yes, include labels and a legend for easy identification.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Highlight the critical pathways and mention any dependencies.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for fonts and styles.'
