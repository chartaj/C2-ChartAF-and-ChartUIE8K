initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trend of body mass over years
  for different penguin species grouped by island. Highlight significant deviations
  and annotate missing data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different penguin species
  or islands?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  3. Do you want to display the data points along the line or just the trend lines?

  4. Would you prefer a continuous line for missing data points or a gap to indicate
  missing values?

  5. How would you like the significant deviations to be highlighted (e.g., color
  change, marker, annotation)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the style or placement of annotations for missing
  data points?

  7. Should the x-axis be segmented by individual years or in broader time frames
  (e.g., grouped by decades)?

  8. Do you want legends displayed inside or outside the plot area?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for labels and annotations?

  10. Do you need any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  11. Would you like to include error bars or confidence intervals if applicable?

  12. Is there a preferred ordering for the penguin species or islands in the legend?'
