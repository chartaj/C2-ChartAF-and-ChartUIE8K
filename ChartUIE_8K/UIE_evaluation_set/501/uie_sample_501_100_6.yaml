initial_prompt: I have penguin data with columns like species, island, bill dimensions,
  flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. Please create a histogram showing the
  distribution of bill lengths (bill_length_mm). I'd like to see how the bill lengths
  vary among different species. Use distinct colors for each species to make the chart
  more informative. Ensure the histogram bins are appropriately sized to capture the
  range of bill lengths. This will help in understanding the diversity in bill lengths
  among penguins from different species studied over the years. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors in mind for
  each species?

  2. What title would you like for the histogram?

  3. Do you have any specific labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific bin width or number of bins for the histogram?

  6. What legend placement do you prefer (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?

  7. Is there any specific style or theme you prefer for the histogram (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, professional)?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or additional information on the chart,
  such as mean bill length for each species?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. "Distribution of Bill Lengths Among Penguin Species"

  3. X-axis: "Bill Length (mm)", Y-axis: "Frequency"

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Professional

  8. I am not sure.'
