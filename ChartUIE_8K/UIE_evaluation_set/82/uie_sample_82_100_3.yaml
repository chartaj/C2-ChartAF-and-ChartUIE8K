initial_prompt: I would like to create a scatter plot using the "Global Country Information
  Dataset 2023". The scatter plot should visualize the relationship between GDP and
  Birth Rate for the given countries. Let's use the x-axis for the GDP and the y-axis
  for the Birth Rate. Each point should represent a country, and it would be great
  if the points could be colored based on the Life Expectancy to add another layer
  of insight. Please ensure that the country names are labeled on the plot for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to represent Life
  Expectancy?

  2. Would you like the size of the points to vary based on another attribute, such
  as Population?

  3. Do you have a specific range or scale for the GDP and Birth Rate axes?

  4. Would you prefer a log scale for the GDP axis due to potentially wide variations
  in GDP values?

  5. Is there any specific font style or size you would like for the country name
  labels?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should we include a legend to explain the color coding for Life Expectancy?

  8. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or annotate differently?

  9. Would you like to add regression lines or trend lines to show the correlation
  more clearly?

  10. Is there a particular format for displaying the GDP and Birth Rate values (e.g.,
  scientific notation for large values)?'
