initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the "Country" dataset to visualize
  the distribution of "Life expectancy" across different countries. The X-axis should
  represent the bins of life expectancy ranges, and the Y-axis should show the count
  of countries falling within each range. Make sure to handle any missing values appropriately
  and use clear labels for better understanding. This will help us see how life expectancy
  varies globally and identify any significant trends or outliers. Thank you!
questions: '1. What bin sizes would you prefer for life expectancy ranges on the X-axis?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the histogram?

  3. Would you like to set any specific ranges for the bins (e.g., 0-10, 10-20) for
  the X-axis?

  4. Do you want the histogram to have gridlines for better readability?

  5. How would you like to label the X-axis and Y-axis?

  6. Should the Y-axis show absolute counts or percentages?

  7. Do you prefer to handle missing values by removing them or imputing them? If
  imputing, what method would you prefer?

  8. Do you want to highlight any specific regions or countries within the histogram?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and titles?

  10. Do you need a legend or additional annotations on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific color preferences.
