initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of "Life Expectancy"
  across different countries. This chart will help understand the spread and central
  tendency of life expectancy values globally. Include labels for the minimum, first
  quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum life expectancy values. Additionally,
  highlight any outliers. This visualization will give insights into disparities in
  life expectancy between nations. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret and visually
  appealing by appropriately labeling axes and adding a title. Please use the data
  from the Global Country Information Dataset 2023. Thank you!
