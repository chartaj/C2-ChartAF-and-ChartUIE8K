initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the GDP of different countries
  across the world. Use the 'Country' column for mapping country names, 'GDP' column
  for the GDP values, 'Latitude' and 'Longitude' columns for accurate country positioning.
  Make sure to use a color gradient to represent different GDP levels, with more intense
  colors representing higher GDPs. Ensure the heatmap is interactive, allowing users
  to hover over a country to see its GDP value. Please title the map "Global GDP Distribution
  2023" and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color gradient used to represent
  different GDP levels?

  2. What range of colors would you like to use for the lower and higher GDP values?

  3. Should we include any particular geographic regions or exclude any specific countries
  from the visualization?

  4. Do you have a preferred map projection for the geographic heatmap (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the map, apart from the
  GDP values?

  6. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the map''s title and legend?

  7. Are there any specific data ranges or outliers you would like to highlight or
  treat differently in the heatmap?

  8. Do you have a preference for the map background (e.g., plain, satellite imagery,
  terrain)?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or data (e.g.,
  population, land area) in the hover-over tooltips?

  10. Is there a specific resolution or aspect ratio you prefer for the geographic
  heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No, please include all countries.

  4. Mercator projection would be fine.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. No specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Plain background is preferred.

  9. No, just the GDP values are sufficient.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
