initial_prompt: Visualize Nobel laureate gender distribution with a choropleth map.
  Highlight male dominance, using annotations on notable countries. Provide organizational
  affiliations and notable outliers, emphasizing historical trends from 1901 to present.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the choropleth map?

  2. Are there particular countries you want to include annotations for, other than
  those that will be highlighted for male dominance?

  3. Would you like specific years or time periods highlighted to emphasize historical
  trends, or should the entire time range from 1901 to present be equally represented?

  4. Do you have any preference on the style of annotations (e.g., text boxes, labels,
  icons) for notable countries and outliers?

  5. Should the organizational affiliations be presented as tooltips, labels, or a
  separate legend?

  6. Do you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.) for
  the choropleth map?

  7. Are there any additional data filters or segments you want to view in the visualization?

  8. Would you like to include any interactive elements like sliders for year selection,
  even if interactivity isn''t the main focus?'
