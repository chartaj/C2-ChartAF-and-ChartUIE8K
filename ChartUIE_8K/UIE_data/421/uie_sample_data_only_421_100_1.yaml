  country and birth year. Highlight male laureates to emphasize the male dominance
  in Nobel Prizes. Include data-driven text annotations for notable winning years
  and changes in trends. Highlight specific elements by modifying appearance, such
  as color for birth countries with most laureates. Add non-data-driven annotations
  to provide historical context and significant world events influencing the awards.
