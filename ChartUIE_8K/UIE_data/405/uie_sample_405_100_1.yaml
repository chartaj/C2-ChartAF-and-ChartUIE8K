initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the 'days' versus 'sale_index' data.
  Annotate key data points to highlight notable sales trends and confidence intervals.
  Use different colors to make these annotations stand out. Ensure the x-axis is labeled
  'Days' and the y-axis as 'Sale Index'. This chart intends to provide an overview
  of the average sale index over time for business analysis. The confidence interval
  data ('CI_left' and 'CI_right') can be represented as shaded areas around the 'sale_index'
  line for better clarity and understanding of the data's variability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart and annotations?

  2. Are there specific key data points you would like highlighted or should they
  be automatically selected based on the trends?

  3. Would you prefer any specific style or thickness for the lines representing the
  ''sale_index'' and confidence intervals?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for the data point annotations?

  5. Is there a specific format or design you would prefer for the shaded areas representing
  the confidence intervals?

  6. Would you like any custom labels or titles for the chart besides the default
  axis labels?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  annotations?

  8. Do you have a preference for the grid appearance or background of the chart?

  9. Are there any other additional features or elements you would like to include
  in the chart (e.g., legend placement, axis scaling)?'
