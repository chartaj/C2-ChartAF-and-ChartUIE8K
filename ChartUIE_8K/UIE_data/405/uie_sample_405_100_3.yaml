initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the average sale index across
  the days. The chart should have "days" on the x-axis and "sale index" on the y-axis.
  Highlight the confidence intervals (CI_left and CI_right) as error bars to show
  the range of uncertainty for each sale index. Make sure to include the exact values
  and labels for clarity. This will help our business to understand the sales trends
  over time as well as the reliability of the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the bars and error bars?

  2. Would you prefer the x-axis labels to be displayed horizontally or angled?

  vertical, or both?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for the labels?

  5. Where would you like the legend to be positioned (if needed)?

  6. Do you want the confidence intervals to be represented in a specific style, such

  7. Would you like a title on the chart? If yes, do you have a specific wording in
  mind?

  8. Is there any specific area you want to highlight on the chart, such as a particular
