initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize our business data related
  to the average sale index over a period of 100 days. Each point should represent
  the 'sale_index' of a specific day. Annotate key data points with their values to
  highlight significant trends, especially those with unusually high or low sale indexes.
  Use colors or larger markers to emphasize these points. Add annotations to provide
  context or insights, such as identifying peak sales days. This will help us quickly
  understand trends and identify any outliers in our sales performance over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting key data
  points with unusually high or low sale indexes?

  2. Would you like to use a gradient color scheme to indicate the intensity of the
  sale indexes?

  3. Do you have a preference for the background color of the scatter plot?

  4. Are there any specific markers or symbols you prefer to use for the key data
  points?

  5. Do you have any specific fonts or styles for the annotations to ensure readability?

  6. Should we include a legend to explain what the colors or marker sizes represent?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels (font size, color,
  etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reading of data points?

  9. Would you like the annotations to include additional context, such as the date,
  along with the sale index value?

  10. Are there any specific labels or markers you would like to use for noting peak
  sales days?
