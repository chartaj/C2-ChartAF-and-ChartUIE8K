initial_prompt: I need a stacked area chart to visualize the sales data over 100 days
  from multiple sources. Specifically, I want to see how the sale index evolves over
  time and how the confidence intervals (CI_left and CI_right) vary. The chart should
  show the average sale index and include separate areas for the CI ranges. Please
  ensure that it accurately reflects trends and potential uncertainties. Given this
  data is crucial for business decisions, clarity and readability are essential. If
  there are any missing values, handle them gracefully to not distort the analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme or color palette used
  in the chart?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines to improve readability?

  3. Do you want labels on the data points or just on the axes?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to describe the different areas on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart?

  6. Should the chart have a title and, if so, what should it be?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or scale on the Y-axis?

  8. How would you like the X-axis (days) to be labeledâ€”daily, weekly, or another
  interval?

  9. Would you like the confidence interval areas to be shaded or outlined differently
  to distinguish them more clearly?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or reference lines you want to include on
  the chart?'
