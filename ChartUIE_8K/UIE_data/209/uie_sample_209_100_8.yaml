initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the relationship between
  property type ("TYPE") and the number of beds ("BEDS") for the New York housing
  market. Each bar should represent a type of property and be divided into segments
  based on the number of beds, showing how many properties of each type fall into
  each bed category. This will help us understand the distribution of bed counts across
  different property types in the market. Use different colors for each bed category
  to make the segments easily distinguishable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or a color palette you would
  like to use for different bed categories?

  2. What is your preferred order for displaying property types on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want to include labels for the segments representing the number of properties
  in each bed category?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to map colors to bed categories?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you prefer to include gridlines for better readability? If so, should they
  be for both axes or only one?

  7. Would you like to add axis titles for the x-axis and y-axis? If yes, what should
  they be?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for chart labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific property type or bed category in the
  chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s overall layout, such as its aspect
  ratio or size?'
