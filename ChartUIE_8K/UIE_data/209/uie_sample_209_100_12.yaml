initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the New York Housing Market data.
  Use property prices (PRICE) on the x-axis and property square footage (PROPERTYSQFT)
  on the y-axis. The size of the bubbles should represent the number of beds (BEDS),
  and the color of the bubbles should differentiate the property type (TYPE). Include
  the legend to distinguish types of properties and make sure the chart title reflects
  that it's for the New York Housing Market. Make it interactive to hover over bubbles
  to see details like broker title, address, and formatted address.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to differentiate
  property types?

  2. Would you prefer a specific size range for the bubbles to represent the number
  of beds?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the chart title and legend?

  4. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart axes?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for their appearance?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the format or layout of the details seen when
  hovering over the bubbles?

  9. Would you like to include any custom branding elements, such as logos or specific
  color themes?'
