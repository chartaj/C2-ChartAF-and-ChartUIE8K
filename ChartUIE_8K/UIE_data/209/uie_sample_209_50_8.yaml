initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of different property
  types (TYPE) across various localities (LOCALITY) with PRICE. Color code by property
  type for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for property types?

  3. Do you prefer specific labels for the x-axis and y-axis, or should we use ''Localities''
  and ''Prices'' respectively?

  4. Would you like to include a legend indicating property types? If so, where should
  it be positioned?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the localities to be arranged?
  (e.g., alphabetical, by median price, etc.)

  6. Do you want to display the exact price values on the bars?

  7. Should the y-axis display be in specific units (e.g., thousands, millions)?

  8. Are there specific font preferences for the chart text (title, axis labels, legends)?

  (e.g., average prices, highest price for each locality)?'
