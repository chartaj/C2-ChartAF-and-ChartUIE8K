initial_prompt: I have some data about the New York housing market, specifically real
  estate properties including their prices, locations, and sizes. I'd like to create
  a geographic heatmap that displays property prices across different areas in New
  York. This map should show variations in property values, with high-priced areas
  highlighted distinctly from lower-priced ones. Use latitude and longitude for precise
  plotting, and incorporate other data like property types (e.g., condo, house) and
  sizes to add more context. Highlight areas like Manhattan, Staten Island, and any
  notable differences in the boroughs.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting high-priced and
  low-priced areas?

  2. Are there specific price ranges or thresholds that you want to highlight distinctly
  on the heatmap?

  3. Do you want the map to focus on only certain boroughs or cover all of New York
  City?

  4. Would you like to include any specific markers or symbols to denote different
  property types?

  5. How detailed do you want the map to be in terms of zoom level or granularity?
  Should it show individual properties clearly or just the general trend in each area?

  6. Would you prefer the map to show average prices, median prices, or another statistical
  measure for each area?

  7. Should the map include labels for notable areas and boroughs like Manhattan and
  Staten Island?

  8. Do you have a preference for the type of base map (e.g., satellite, street map,
  minimalistic) used in the visualization?

  9. Is there specific additional context or annotations you want to include with
  the map (e.g., legends, side notes)?

  10. Would you like to include any filters or layers to allow the audience to toggle
  between different property types or sizes?'
