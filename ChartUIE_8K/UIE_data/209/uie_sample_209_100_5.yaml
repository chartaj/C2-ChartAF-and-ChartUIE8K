initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart to compare the housing market data in
  New York. The chart should show different property types (e.g., Condo, House) on
  the x-axis, with bars grouped by the number of Beds. The y-axis should represent
  the average Prices. Use different colors for different numbers of Beds. Include
  labels for PRICE, TYPE, and BEDS. Make sure it highlights variations in housing
  prices based on the type of property and the number of bedrooms. This will help
  visualize how property prices vary with these two factors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the number
  of bedrooms?

  2. Do you want gridlines on the chart for improved readability?

  3. Should the y-axis start at zero or adjust based on data range?

  4. Do you have a preferred font for labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  6. Would you like to display data values on top of the bars?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the bars (e.g., solid, striped)?

  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., bottom, right, top)?

  9. Are there specific labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart (e.g.,
  average price tags, total number of properties)?

  10. Would you like to apply any specific data sorting for the x-axis categories?'
