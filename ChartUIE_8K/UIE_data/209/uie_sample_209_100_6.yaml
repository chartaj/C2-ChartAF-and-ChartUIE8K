initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the New York Housing Market
  data. Plot the 'PRICE' on the y-axis and 'PROPERTYSQFT' on the x-axis. Use different
  colors to represent the 'TYPE' of property (e.g., Condo, House). Include data points'
  'BEDS' and 'BATH' as annotations or tooltips for better understanding. Ensure that
  the chart is clear and easy to interpret. This will help in analyzing the relationship
  between property prices and their sizes across different types of homes. Also, make
  sure to label the axes and provide a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  differentiate the ''TYPE'' of properties?

  2. Do you prefer the annotations for ''BEDS'' and ''BATH'' to appear directly on
  the chart or as tooltips when hovering over the data points?

  3. Would you like the size of the data points to represent any specific attribute,
  such as the number of ''BEDS'' or ''BATH''?

  4. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font type or size for the labels and annotations on
  the chart?

  6. Should the grid lines on the chart be displayed or hidden?

  7. Do you have any preferred background color or theme for the chart (e.g., light,
  dark, etc.)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional context or reference lines, such as
  average price or size markers, on the chart?'
