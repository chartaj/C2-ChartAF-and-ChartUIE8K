initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualizing the New York Housing Market data. Use
  the `PRICE` column to represent the size of each segment in the Treemap. Categorize
  the segments by `TYPE`, `LOCALITY`, and `BEDS`. Each type (e.g., Condo for sale,
  House for sale) should be a distinct color. Show detailed labels by combining `ADDRESS`
  and `PRICE`. This will help in identifying high-value properties quickly. Use `FORMATTED_ADDRESS`
  for tooltips that appear on hovering. Ensure the data is easy to understand for
  real-estate investors and homebuyers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to distinguish
  property types?

  2. How would you like the detailed labels to be formatted?

  3. Do you have a preference for the default sorting order for the segments (e.g.,
  by PRICE or TYPE)?

  4. How granular would you like the `BEDS` category to be (e.g., exact number of
  beds, grouped ranges)?

  5. Is there a preferred text size or style for the labels?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the complexity of the tooltips? How much information
  should they contain beyond the `FORMATTED_ADDRESS`?

  7. Should we include any specific annotations or highlights for properties above
  a certain price threshold?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. By PRICE.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Just the `FORMATTED_ADDRESS` would be fine.

  7. I do not know.'
