initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of property prices
  in the New York housing market. Highlight the differences between condos and houses
  for sale. Use the "PRICE" as the primary variable on the y-axis and "TYPE" on the
  x-axis to distinguish the categories. Add text annotations for properties with the
  highest and lowest prices to draw attention. The purpose is to provide a clear visual
  comparison of price distributions, helping users understand market trends. Ensure
  the plot is clear and visually appealing, with color differentiation for condos
  and houses.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating condos and
  houses?

  2. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations?

  3. Do you want to include grid lines in the plot for better readability?

  4. Would you like to customize the y-axis scale (linear or logarithmic)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific layout or aspect ratio for the plot?

  6. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the violin plots?

  7. Should the title of the chart and axis labels have any specific text or format?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to distinguish between condos and houses, and
  if so, where should it be positioned?'
