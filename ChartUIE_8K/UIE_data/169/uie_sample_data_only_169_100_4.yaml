02_initial_prompt: Could you please create a choropleth map to visualize the distribution
  of soft tissue sarcoma cases based on the "Site of primary STS" data from the dataset?
  I'd like the map to show the frequency of occurrences in different body regions
  provided, such as the left buttock, right buttock, left thigh, etc. Use a color
  gradient to represent the number of cases in each region. This will help visualize
  which areas are most frequently affected by sarcoma. Include a legend to clarify
  the color scale.
