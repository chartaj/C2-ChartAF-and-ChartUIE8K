initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between demographic
  and clinical factors (Age, Sex, Grade, etc.) and outcomes (Time to follow-up, Treatment)
  for Soft Tissue Sarcoma patients. Highlight significant correlations. Include text
  annotations for key findings.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a color legend to indicate the strength of correlations?

  3. How would you prefer to handle non-significant correlations (e.g., using a neutral
  color)?

  4. Are there any specific text annotations or comments you want to include for key
  findings?

  5. Do you have a preferred method for determining and highlighting significant correlations
  (e.g., p-values, threshold values)?

  6. Would you like the heatmap to include grid lines to separate cells more clearly?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to show raw correlation values or only highlight significant
  ones?

  8. Should the heatmap include labels on both axes for all demographic and clinical
  factors and outcomes?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like to order or cluster the rows and columns
  in the heatmap (e.g., hierarchical clustering, alphabetical)?

  10. Should any specific demographic or clinical factors be emphasized or focused
  on more prominently in the visualization?

  11. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations in the heatmap?'
