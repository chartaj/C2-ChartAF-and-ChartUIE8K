initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to categorize the patients by 'Site of
  primary STS' and show the distribution of 'Status (NED, AWD, D)'. Each bar should
  represent a different site, with segments for each status. Use text annotations
  to highlight key segments, particularly cases with 'D' status. Apply color highlights
  to distinguish between 'NED', 'AWD', and 'D'. This will help visualize the status
  and outcomes of patients with Soft Tissue Sarcomas. Add context annotations about
  treatment types, focusing on those receiving 'Radiotherapy + Surgery'. Ensure the
  chart is clear and informative for health data analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  ''NED'', ''AWD'', and ''D'' statuses?

  2. Is there a preferred orientation for the text annotations (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  4. Should the annotations for treatment types be placed within the bars or outside?

  5. Are there any specific details or footnotes you would like to be included with
  the contextual annotations?

  6. Would you like to use any specific margin or padding around the chart for better
  readability?

  7. Would you prefer the bars to have spacing between them, or should they be completely
  adjacent?

  8. Do you have any preference for the overall color scheme or theme of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Horizontal would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Outside the bars, please.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Completely adjacent bars.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
