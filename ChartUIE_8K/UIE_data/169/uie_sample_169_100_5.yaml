initial_prompt: I have data on soft tissue sarcomas, with various patient details
  such as age, grade, histological type, treatment, and outcomes. Iâ€™d like a box plot
  to visualize the distribution of patient ages across different histological types.
  This chart will help identify age-related trends in sarcoma types. Please ensure
  the box plot includes distinct colors for each histological type, and the x-axis
  should represent the histological type while the y-axis shows the patient age. Annotate
  outliers explicitly and highlight the median age within each box for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for each histological type?

  2. Do you prefer any particular style for the annotation of outliers?

  3. How would you like the median age to be highlighted (e.g., a line, a dot, different
  color)?

  4. Do you want any specific labels or legends for the histological types on the
  x-axis?

  5. Is there a particular format or style you prefer for the y-axis that represents
  patient age?

  6. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Are there any additional statistical markers you would like to see on the box
  plot (e.g., quartiles, mean)?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels in
  the chart?

  9. Would you like the chart title and axis titles to be customized in a specific
  way? If yes, please provide details.

  10. Are there any additional elements or highlights you would like to include to
  make the data visualization more effective for your audience?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific colors in mind for each histological type.

  2. I am not sure about the style for the annotation of outliers.

  3. A different color would be good to highlight the median age.

  4. I do not know, standard labels for histological types should be fine.

  5. I have no specific preference for the y-axis format.

  6. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I am not sure about additional statistical markers.

  8. I do not have a preferred font style or size for annotations and labels.

  9. I do not have a specific customization in mind for the chart title and axis titles.

  10. I am not sure about any additional elements or highlights.'
