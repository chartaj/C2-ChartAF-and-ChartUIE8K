initial_prompt: Could you please create a choropleth map to visualize the distribution
  of soft tissue sarcoma cases based on the "Site of primary STS" data from the dataset?
  I'd like the map to show the frequency of occurrences in different body regions
  provided, such as the left buttock, right buttock, left thigh, etc. Use a color
  gradient to represent the number of cases in each region. This will help visualize
  which areas are most frequently affected by sarcoma. Include a legend to clarify
  the color scale.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradient preferences or requirements
  for the choropleth map?

  2. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the map (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  scientific)?

  3. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the map?

  4. Do you have a preferred range or classification method for the color scale (e.g.,
  natural breaks, quantiles)?

  5. Are there any specific labeling or annotation preferences for the different body
  regions?

  6. Do you need any additional text or notes to be included on the map for context
  or explanation?

  7. Do you have any specific map projection preferences?

  8. Should the map include borders or outlines for different body regions for better
  visualization?

  9. Are there any specific regions or details you would like to highlight or emphasize
  in the visualization?

  10. Do you want to include a title or subtitle on the map? If so, please provide
  the text.'
