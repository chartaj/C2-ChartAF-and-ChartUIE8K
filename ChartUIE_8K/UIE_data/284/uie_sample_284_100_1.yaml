initial_prompt: I want a histogram to visualize the Alzheimer’s disease dataset. Highlight
  the different ages and annotate the average MMSE scores for selected age groups
  to draw attention to cognitive performance by age. Use color to differentiate between
  various ages and include an indication of sample size for each age group. The purpose
  is to see if there's a pattern in MMSE scores as age progresses among Alzheimer's
  patients. This visualization will be useful for medical researchers to understand
  the relationship between age and cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s patients accurately.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific age range that you want to highlight in the
  histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer to differentiate between various ages?

  3. Is there a preferred style for annotating the average MMSE scores (e.g., inline
  text, labels, markers)?

  4. Would you like the sample size for each age group to be shown as a label on the
  histogram or as a separate legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred bin width or specific age intervals for the histogram?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall appearance, such as background color
  or gridlines?

  8. Would you like any additional information included in the tooltip when hovering
  over the histogram bars?

  9. Are there any specific statistical measures or additional data points you want
  to include in the visualization?

  10. Would you like to include any reference lines or thresholds on the histogram
  to mark significant MMSE scores?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  3. Inline text would be fine for annotating the average MMSE scores.

  4. As a separate legend.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I do not know.
