  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the highlighted BMI differences?

  6. Are there any specific labeling preferences for the x-axis (PatientID) and y-axis
  (Age and MMSE scores)?

  7. Would you like to include data point markers on the line chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for the Age and MMSE
  score lines?

  9. Should the chart include a title? If so, do you have a preferred title?

  10. Would you like to display the exact values of Age, MMSE scores, and BMI on hover
  or directly on the chart?'
