initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart using the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset
  to compare patient demographics and health indicators. Use 'Age', 'Gender', 'Ethnicity'
  as category columns stacked against 'CholesterolTotal', 'CholesterolLDL', 'CholesterolHDL',
  and 'CholesterolTriglycerides'. In the chart, each category (e.g., different age
  groups, genders, ethnicities) should have a corresponding stacked column showing
  the composition of their cholesterol levels. This will help visualize how these
  factors might be related to cholesterol levels among patients in the dataset. Format
  labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be categorized (e.g., specific age ranges)?

  3. Should specific colors be assigned to each gender and ethnicity category?

  4. Do you prefer specific sorting order for categories on the x-axis?

  5. How detailed should the labels and titles be (e.g., only primary labels or including
  annotations)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for labels and titles?

  8. Do you have any preference on the chart size or aspect ratio?

  9. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison?

  10. Do you require any specific pattern (e.g., stripes or dots) for differentiating
  the stacked segments?'
