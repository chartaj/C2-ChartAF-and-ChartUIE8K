initial_prompt: I want a bar chart that shows the average BMI for different age groups
  (e.g., 60-69, 70-79, 80-89). Use the Alzheimer's Disease Dataset. The bars should
  be different colors for each age range. Title the chart "Average BMI by Age Group".
  Make sure to label the X-axis with the age ranges and the Y-axis with the average
  BMI values. Use data from the `Age` and `BMI` columns. Highlight if there is any
  particular age group with significantly higher or lower BMI. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for the different age ranges?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the title, axis labels, and axis
  values?

  3. Would you like any gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be on the X-axis,
  Y-axis, or both?

  4. Do you have any preference for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  5. Should the chart include data labels on the bars indicating the average BMI values?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to follow a specific style or theme?

  7. Would you like to include a legend in the chart to denote the age ranges, even
  when the bars are color-coded?

  8. Is there any specific way you''d like us to highlight the age group with significantly
  higher or lower BMI (e.g., using a different color or pattern)?

  9. Do you want any annotations or notes on the chart to emphasize particular observations?'
