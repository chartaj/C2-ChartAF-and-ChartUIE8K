initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between Alzheimer's
  disease risk factors such as Age, BMI, Smoking, AlcoholConsumption, PhysicalActivity,
  DietQuality, SleepQuality, and FamilyHistoryAlzheimers, including cognitive assessment
  scores like MMSE and FunctionalAssessment.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., cool colors,
  warm colors, specific color gradients)?

  2. Are there any specific labels, titles, or legends you would like included or
  customized?

  3. Do you prefer the correlation values to be displayed directly on the heatmap
  cells?

  4. How would you like to handle any missing or incomplete data points?

  5. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the heatmap?

  6. Do you want grid lines or cell borders to be visible in the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap have annotated correlation values (e.g., +/- 0.9, 0.7) for
  better clarity?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to group the attributes in any specific order, such as grouping
  risk factors and cognitive assessments separately?'
