initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualizing the correlation between different health
  factors and the occurrence of Alzheimer's disease according to the data given. The
  dataset includes columns like Age, BMI, Smoking, AlcoholConsumption, PhysicalActivity,
  DietQuality, SleepQuality, etc. Please represent the correlations between these
  factors and the presence of Alzheimer's (Diagnosis). Use color gradients to show
  the strength and direction of the correlations, with labels for each variable so
  it's clear and easy to interpret. Also, include a legend explaining the color coding.
  Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What color gradients would you like for positive and negative correlations?

  3. Would you prefer specific label formats for the variables?

  4. Is there a specific font type or size you would like for the labels?

  5. How would you like the correlation values to be represented? (e.g., numerical
  values within the cells)

  6. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the variables on the axes?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or notes included on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would prefer for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, maybe something standard like red for negative and blue for positive
  correlations.

  3. No specific label format preference.

  4. I do not know. Whatever is clear and easy to read.

  5. Yes, please include numerical values within the cells.

  6. No preferred order for displaying the variables.

  7. No specific annotations needed.

  8. Just a simple title like "Correlation Heatmap of Health Factors and Alzheimer''s
  Disease".'
