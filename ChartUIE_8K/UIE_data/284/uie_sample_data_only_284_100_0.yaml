  I want to create a box chart to visualize the distribution of ''MMSE'' scores among
  different ''Age'' groups in the Alzheimer''s Disease dataset. Highlight the quartiles
  and median to emphasize central tendency and spread. Annote the box plot with the
  highest and lowest ''MMSE'' score for each age group, drawing attention to outliers.
  This visualization will help identify any potential age-related patterns in cognitive
  function as measured by the MMSE score. The audience is healthcare professionals
