initial_prompt: Create an area chart visualizing the daily total bicycle crossings
  over the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro Bridges in NYC for April
  2016. X-axis should represent the date, and the Y-axis should depict the total number
  of crossings. Each bridge should be color-coded within the chart to show their individual
  contributions to the total crossings. Include high and low temperatures as a secondary
  Y-axis plotted alongside, using lines or markers to highlight any correlation between
  weather and bike usage. Title the chart "Daily Bicycle Crossings and Temperature
  Trends - NYC Bridges, April 2016."
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the bridges in the area
  chart?

  2. How would you like the high and low temperatures to be represented alongside
  the area chart (e.g., lines, markers, or both)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of the chart title?

  elements in the chart?

  6. Would you prefer a particular theme or style for the chart (e.g., minimalistic,

  7. Do you want gridlines or any background patterns in the chart for better readability?

  8. Should there be any annotations or highlights to call out specific data points
  or trends?

  9. Do you have preferences for the placement and styling of the legend?

  10. Are there any specific labels or captions you would like on the axes, other
  than the defaults?'
