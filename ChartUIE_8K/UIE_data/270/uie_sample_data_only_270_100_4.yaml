02_initial_prompt: Create an area chart visualizing the daily total bicycle crossings
  over the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Queensboro Bridges in NYC for April
  2016. X-axis should represent the date, and the Y-axis should depict the total number
  of crossings. Each bridge should be color-coded within the chart to show their individual
  contributions to the total crossings. Include high and low temperatures as a secondary
  Y-axis plotted alongside, using lines or markers to highlight any correlation between
  weather and bike usage. Title the chart "Daily Bicycle Crossings and Temperature
  Trends - NYC Bridges, April 2016."
