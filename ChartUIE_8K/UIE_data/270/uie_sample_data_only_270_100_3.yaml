02_initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of bicycle
  crossings over the four East River bridges in New York City. Use the data for Brooklyn
  Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Williamsburg Bridge, and Queensboro Bridge. We're interested
  in understanding the variability and central tendency for each bridge. The x-axis
  should represent the bridge names, while the y-axis should show the number of bicycle
  crossings. Ensure the plot includes labels and a title. This will help us analyze
  and compare the typical bicycle crossing patterns on these major bridges.
