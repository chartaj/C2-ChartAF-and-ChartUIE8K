initial_prompt: 'I would like to visualize the daily high and low temperatures along
  with the total number of cyclist crossings over the East River bridges in NYC. Create
  a line chart with dual y-axes: one for temperature (°F) and the other for the total
  crossings. Annotate specific temperature data points where there are unusual highs
  and lows, and highlight significant peaks or drops in the cyclist counts. This will
  help identify any correlations between temperature changes and cyclist activity,
  which is essential for urban planning analysis. The visualization should emphasize
  these trends for clearer insights.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors used for the temperature
  and cyclist count lines?

  2. Would you like specific markers for unusual high and low-temperature data points?
  If so, what kind of markers do you prefer (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  3. How would you like the significant peaks or drops in cyclist counts to be highlighted
  (e.g., different color, bold line, annotations)?

  4. Should the x-axis (date) display specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  5. Do you have any preferred fonts or styles for the annotations and labels?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there any specific title or subtitles you''d like to include for the chart?

  8. Do you want legends to be included to differentiate the dual y-axes lines clearly?
  If so, any specific placement for the legend?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer circles for unusual high and low-temperature data points.

  3. Different color for significant peaks or drops in cyclist counts would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  8. Yes, include legends to differentiate the dual y-axes lines clearly. I''m not
  sure about the specific placement.'
