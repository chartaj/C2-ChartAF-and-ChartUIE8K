initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between daily temperatures
  and total bicycle crossings for New York City's East River bridges. Highlight the
  days with the highest and lowest total crossings and annotate these points with
  their temperature values and dates. This will help understand how weather impacts
  cycling activity. Include a trendline to show the general relationship between temperature
  and crossings. Make sure to emphasize the bridges’ total crossings rather than individual
  bridges to keep the chart uncluttered. Provide a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the scatter plot and trendline?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the shape of the scatter plot markers (e.g.,
  circles, squares)?

  3. How would you like the highlighted points to be displayed (e.g., different color,
  larger size)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the trendline (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  5. Where would you like the legend to be placed on the chart (e.g., top right, bottom
  left)?

  6. What font style and size do you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?

  8. Is there a specific format you would like for the date annotation?

  9. Do you prefer the axes to be labeled in a particular way?

  10. Would you like any additional information displayed on the chart, such as a
  title or subtitle? If so, what should it be?'
