initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the daily bicycle crossings
  over four East River bridges in New York City. Use the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg,
  and Queensboro bridge data. Make sure the bars represent the number of crossings
  for each bridge on different dates. Highlight the days with the highest and lowest
  temperatures. Include text annotations to show exact crossing numbers for these
  highlighted days. This will help urban planners understand bicycle traffic patterns
  and potentially correlate them with weather conditions. Use color to distinguish
  between different bridges.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to distinguish
  between different bridges?

  2. Would you like the y-axis to be scaled logarithmically or linearly?

  3. How would you prefer the highlighted days with the highest and lowest temperatures
  to be marked (e.g., different color bars, special icons)?

  4. Do you have any particular font style or size preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Should the data labels for crossing numbers be displayed inside or outside the
  bars?

  6. Do you prefer to include axis gridlines for better readability of the chart?

  7. Is there a specific date range you are most interested in for this visualization?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  9. Do you have any preference for the order of the bridges in the grouped bar chart?

  10. Should we include additional weather data (such as precipitation) as a secondary
  element in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preferences.

  2. Linearly.

  3. I would prefer different color bars for the highlighted days.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Inside the bars.

  6. Yes, please include axis gridlines.

  7. I am not sure.
