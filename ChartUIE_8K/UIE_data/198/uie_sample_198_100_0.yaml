initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing emotions over time from the Emotion
  Dataset in psychology. Highlight peaks of 'fear' and 'anger' using different colors
  for clarity. Annotate these peaks with text annotations to highlight specific emotion
  values. This visualization aims to identify trends and significant points in the
  dataset for better understanding emotional patterns. Use non-data-driven annotations
  to provide context for the peaks and overall trends. Ensure clarity in distinguishing
  'fear' from other emotions to draw the viewerâ€™s attention effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting ''fear'' and
  ''anger'' peaks?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations of the peaks?

  4. Should the x-axis represent specific time intervals (e.g., days, weeks) or be
  adjusted automatically based on data distribution?

  5. Are there any other specific emotions apart from ''fear'' and ''anger'' that
  you want to be highlighted or treated differently?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall chart theme (e.g., light, dark)?

  7. Would you like any additional labels or legends to be included in the chart for
  further clarification?

  8. Should the chart display include markers at all data points or only at the peaks?

  9. Are there any specific non-data-driven annotations you want to include in the
  chart for context?'
