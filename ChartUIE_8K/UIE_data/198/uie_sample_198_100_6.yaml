initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the Emotion dataset from the provided
  psychology data. I want to see the distribution of 'Emotion' values across the comments.
  Make sure each unique emotion (anger, fear, etc.) is represented on the x-axis,
  and the number of comments corresponding to each emotion is represented on the y-axis.
  Use vibrant colors to differentiate between the emotions clearly. The histogram
  should be clean and easy to interpret, helping to understand which emotions are
  most prevalent in the dataset at a glance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the vibrant colors used to
  differentiate emotions?

  2. Would you like the histogram to have gridlines for easier interpretation of values?

  3. Do you prefer specific font styles or sizes for axis labels and titles?

  4. Do you want a legend indicating which color corresponds to which emotion?

  5. Should the x-axis labels (emotion names) be rotated or formatted in a particular
  way to enhance readability?

  6. Are there any specific titles or captions you would like for the histogram?

  7. Do you have preferences for the histogram''s overall layout or dimensions?'
