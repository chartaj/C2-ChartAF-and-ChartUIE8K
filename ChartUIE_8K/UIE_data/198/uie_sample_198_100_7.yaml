initial_prompt: I'd like a word cloud visualizing the "Comment" column from the dataset
  to understand the most frequent words used in different emotional contexts. The
  dataset is psychology-related and deals with emotions like fear and anger. Ensure
  the word cloud distinguishes between the emotions visually—perhaps different colors
  for each emotion—so I can easily identify patterns. Include the most common and
  impactful words that are indicative of each emotion, and make sure the visualization
  is clear and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  different emotions in the word cloud?

  2. Are there specific words or phrases that you would like to highlight or emphasize
  more prominently in the word cloud?

  3. How many words would you like to display in the word cloud (e.g., top 100 most
  frequent words)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the words in the word cloud?

  5. Would you like the word cloud to display words in random order or in a structured
  layout?

  6. Do you want the size of the words to be proportional to their frequency of occurrence?

  7. Are there any specific themes or visual elements you want to include in the word
  cloud''s background or layout?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, maybe different shades to represent fear and anger distinctively.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Top 100 most frequent words would be great.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Random order is fine.

  6. Yes, the size should be proportional to their frequency of occurrence.

  7. I am not sure.'
