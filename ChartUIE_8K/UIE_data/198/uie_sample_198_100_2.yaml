initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the "Emotion Dataset" to visualize the distribution
  of emotions (fear, anger, etc.) in the given comments. The x-axis should represent
  unique comments, and the y-axis should represent different emotions. Annotations
  should highlight key data points, focusing on comments with extreme emotions, and
  provide context or editorial notes. Use color intensity to show the concentration
  of each emotion. This visualization will help understand the prevalence of certain
  emotions in different scenarios, useful for psychological analysis and identifying
  patterns. Make sure to annotate specific interesting trends or anomalies in the
  dataset.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?\n2. How would\
  \ you like the annotations for key data points to be styled? \n3. Should the heatmap\
  \ include a legend explaining the color intensity?\n4. Do you prefer the x-axis\
  \ labels (unique comments) to be angled or rotated for better readability?\n5. Are\
  \ there specific thresholds or criteria for identifying \"extreme emotions\" that\
  \ should be highlighted in the annotations?\n6. Do you want grid lines to be visible\
  \ on the heatmap?\n7. Should the heatmap include tooltips for additional context\
  \ on hover?\n8. Do you prefer the heatmap to be presented in a specific size or\
  \ aspect ratio?\n9. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the\
  \ annotations and axis labels?\n10. Should the heatmap be titled or include a subtitle\
  \ to provide additional context? If so, what should it be?"
