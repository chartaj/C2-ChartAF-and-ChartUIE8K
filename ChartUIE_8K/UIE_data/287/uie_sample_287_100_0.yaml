initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Age and
  UPDRS scores from the Parkinson's Disease Dataset. Use data annotations to display
  values of key data points (e.g., highest and lowest UPDRS scores). Highlight the
  points with different colors based on Diagnosis. This will help identify the distribution
  of motor symptoms severity across different ages and understand the correlation
  between age and Parkinson's disease progression. Make sure each dot is a patient,
  and use varied colors for diagnosed versus non-diagnosed. Include a legend and title
  for context.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the specific color palette to be used
  in the scatter plot?

  2. Are there any specific annotations you would like to include apart from the highest
  and lowest UPDRS scores?

  3. What size should the dots representing patients be?

  4. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for the title and legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot?

  6. Do you prefer axis labels to be horizontal or vertical?

  7. Are there any specific ranges for the age or UPDRS score axes that you would
  like to set?

  8. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend on the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any additional context or notes within the visualization?'
