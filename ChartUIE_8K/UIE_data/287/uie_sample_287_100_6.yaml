initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualization for the Parkinson's Disease Dataset.
  Specifically, I am interested in comparing the distribution of BMI, PhysicalActivity,
  and DietQuality among patients. I want to see the spread and any outliers in these
  variables because they likely impact Parkinson's disease management. The box chart
  should mark median values and quartiles clearly. Including all unique values isn't
  necessary. Confidential patient data like PatientID and DoctorInCharge should be
  excluded for privacy. The chart will help understand how lifestyle factors vary
  in this dataset and potentially correlate with Parkinson's symptoms.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you want the chart to highlight specific quartiles with different colors or
  patterns?

  4. Would you like to include any additional annotations on the chart for median
  or outlier values?

  5. Is there a preferred orientation for the box plots (horizontal or vertical)?

  6. Should the chart have a specific title or subtitle?

  7. Do you want axis labels to be formatted in a particular way (e.g., font size
  or style)?

  8. How detailed should the tooltips or hover information be when viewing the chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the layout or positioning of the legend, if included?

  10. Would you like any specific labels or notes included within the plot area to
  mark significant data points or ranges?'
