initial_prompt: Create a Radar chart to visualize the health parameters related to
  Parkinson's Disease. Utilize columns like PhysicalActivity, DietQuality, SleepQuality,
  CholesterolLevels, UPDRS, MoCA, and FunctionalAssessment. Highlight values such
  as UPDRS and MoCA to emphasize cognitive and motor function. Use text annotations
  to highlight key data points such as the highest and lowest physical activity levels.
  The goal is to compare these parameters across patients and identify patterns. Ensure
  the chart is clear and informative, focusing on correlations between these health
  metrics and Parkinson's Disease diagnosis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different health
  parameters in the radar chart?

  2. Do you want a legend included in the chart to explain the different metrics?

  3. How would you like the highlighted values (UPDRS and MoCA) to be emphasized (e.g.,
  different color, bold lines, larger markers)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations highlighting
  key data points?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, do you have any specific
  wording in mind?

  6. Do you want grid lines in the radar chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like to include a brief description or notes within the chart to explain
  the health parameters and their significance to Parkinson''s Disease?

  8. Is there a specific range that should be used for each axis in the radar chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the overall size or dimensions of the chart?

  10. Would you like to standardize the values of each parameter on a common scale
  before plotting them on the radar chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would like a legend included in the chart to explain the different metrics.

  3. I would like the highlighted values (UPDRS and MoCA) to be emphasized using a
  different color and larger markers.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a title and axis labels. For the title, "Comparison
  of Health Parameters in Parkinson''s Disease Patients" would be good.

  6. Yes, I would like grid lines in the radar chart for better readability.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Yes, I would like to standardize the values of each parameter on a common scale
  before plotting them on the radar chart.'
