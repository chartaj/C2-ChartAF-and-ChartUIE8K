initial_prompt: Please create a box plot chart visualizing the distribution of UPDRS,
  MoCA, and FunctionalAssessment scores in the Parkinson's Disease dataset. Focus
  on showing the variability and possible outliers among the patients. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plot?

  2. Would you like the box plot to display individual data points in addition to
  the box and whiskers?

  3. Should the y-axis be on a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic or linear)?

  4. Do you want specific labels or annotations for the outliers?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the background to help with readability?

  6. Should the box plot include a title and, if so, what should it be?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the format/style of the axis labels
  and ticks?

  8. Would you like to add any reference lines (e.g., median or mean) to the box plot?

  9. Should each box plot (for UPDRS, MoCA, and FunctionalAssessment) be identified
  with specific labels?

  10. Do you want the chart legend to show additional information or details?'
