initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of Age and separate
  histograms for SystolicBP and DiastolicBP. I am interested in analyzing the age
  demographics and blood pressure levels of patients with and without Parkinson's
  disease.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between patients
  with and without Parkinson''s disease?

  2. Would you like the histograms to be displayed side-by-side, overlaid, or in separate
  plots?

  3. What bin size or range would you like for the Age, SystolicBP, and DiastolicBP
  histograms?

  4. Do you want the y-axis to show count, frequency, or density?

  5. Would you prefer to include any specific annotations or labels in the histograms?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.
