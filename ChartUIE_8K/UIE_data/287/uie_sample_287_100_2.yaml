initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of Parkinson's
  diagnosis among different age groups. Annotate the chart to highlight specific data
  points, such as the highest and lowest prevalence of diagnosis. Use the 'Age' and
  'Diagnosis' columns to create age ranges and their corresponding diagnosed cases.
  Aim to emphasize the age group with the highest diagnosis rate. The purpose is to
  identify trends in diagnosis across different age groups to aid in the understanding
  and early detection of Parkinson's.

  bar chart?

  3. How would you like the highest and lowest prevalence of diagnosis to be annotated
  in the chart?

  4. Do you want any additional labels or titles in the chart to enhance clarity?

  5. Should the age groups be represented in ascending or descending order in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  3. I would like the highest prevalence to be highlighted with a bold text annotation
