initial_prompt: 'I''d like a line chart to visualize Parkinson''s Disease trends.
  Use the dataset with patient data and medical history. Plot UPDRS scores on the
  y-axis and Age on the x-axis to observe how Parkinson''s severity correlates with
  age. Please ensure to differentiate the lines by Diagnosis (0 or 1) for clearer
  understanding. Utilize color coding: one color for patients diagnosed with Parkinson''s
  and another for non-diagnosed. Add markers to indicate individual data points. Make
  sure both axes are clearly labeled and include a legend for the diagnosis differentiation.
  Thank you!'
