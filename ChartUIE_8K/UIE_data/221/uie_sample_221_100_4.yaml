initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualization for the Traveler Trip Dataset.
  I am particularly interested in seeing the proportionate distribution of 'Accommodation
  type' and 'Transportation type' across all trips. The pie chart should help illustrate
  which types of accommodation and transportation are most commonly used by travelers.
  Make sure to also include legends or labels to indicate the specific accommodation
  and transportation categories and their respective percentages. This will provide
  a clearer understanding of travel preferences in terms of lodging and travel modes.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the pie chart segments?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to display absolute values in addition to percentages?

  3. Should the pie chart have a 3D effect or remain flat?

  4. Do you want labels on the chart segments or should the legend be sufficient?

  5. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, please provide the desired title.

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  7. Should the chart include data for both ''Accommodation type'' and ''Transportation
  type'' in a single pie chart or separate pie charts for each?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the categories to be displayed in (e.g.,
  in descending order of frequency)?'
