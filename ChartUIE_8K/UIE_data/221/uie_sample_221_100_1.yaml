initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total costs of accommodations
  and transportation for each destination, using the Traveler Trip Dataset. Include
  text annotations to display specific costs for each bar segment. Highlight different
  accommodation types with unique colors and stack transportation costs atop the accommodation
  costs for each destination. This chart will help to compare the travel expenses
  between destinations and identify cost patterns. Ensure that missing values and
  different data types are appropriately handled. The purpose is to provide a clear
  visual comparison of travel expenses for better budget planning.
