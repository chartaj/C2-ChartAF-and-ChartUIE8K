initial_prompt: I have trip data including Trip ID, Destination, Dates, Duration,
  Traveler details, and Costs. I need a heatmap that visualizes the relationship between
  different destinations and average accommodation cost. Also, show how traveler age
  correlates with transportation cost across various destinations. The heatmap should
  help identify patterns or trends in costs associated with different traveler demographics
  and destination preferences. Please ensure the heatmap highlights high and low-cost
  areas prominently. Provide clear labels for all axes and a legend explaining the
  color gradients used for cost variations. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer specific color gradients to represent high and low-cost areas?

  3. What range of ages would you like to be highlighted for traveler age correlations?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotation or markers on the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size or format of the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific destinations you want to ensure are prominently featured?

  7. Is there a specific way you want the data to be grouped or categorized on the
  heatmap?'
