initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating the trend of accommodation and transportation
  costs over time for different travel destinations using the given travel dataset.
  Highlight key data points where costs significantly change, and add text annotations
  for those points. The chart should help travelers and trip planners quickly understand
  cost patterns in different destinations and make informed decisions. Additionally,
  use annotations to provide context or comments about the data, such as peak travel
  times or special events influencing costs. This visualization will assist in comparative
  analysis and budgeting for future trips.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Should the chart use a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. Do you want the x-axis to use the start date, end date, or both?

  4. How do you prefer the destinations to be differentiated in the chart (e.g., different
  colors, line styles)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Are there specific travel destinations you want to focus on or exclude from the
  chart?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to show the data in a specific time range (e.g., last
  year only)?

  8. How should significant changes in cost be highlighted (e.g., larger markers,
  different colors)?

  9. What type of text annotations would you like to add (e.g., descriptive comments,
  numerical values)?

  10. Should the y-axis have a specific range or start from zero?'
