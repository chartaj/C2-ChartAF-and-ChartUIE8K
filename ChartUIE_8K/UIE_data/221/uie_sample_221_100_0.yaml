initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of traveler ages
  in the dataset. Highlight the age groups with the most travelers to emphasize common
  travel demographics. Annotate the bars representing these age groups to display
  the exact number of travelers. This will help identify the age demographics that
  are most likely to travel, providing valuable insights for market analysis in the
  travel industry. Ensure the x-axis represents age groups and the y-axis shows the
  number of travelers. The practical purpose is to understand and target specific
  age groups more efficiently for travel-related campaigns.
