initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of Traveler ages,
  highlighting Travelers aged 30-40. Use text annotations to indicate the average
  age and mention any significant outliers. This will help in understanding the age
  range of our travel customers.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for highlighting the ages 30-40
  in the histogram?

  2. Would you like the text annotations (average age and outliers) to be placed inside
  or outside the bars?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the annotations and labels?

  4. Should the histogram include gridlines for easier reading, and if so, do you
  prefer vertical, horizontal, or both?

  5. Do you have a preferred bin width for the age ranges in the histogram?

  6. Would you like the histogram to include a title and axis labels? If yes, please
  specify the text.

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific scale types (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Would you prefer the histogram to have a legend, especially for the highlighted
  30-40 age range?

  9. Are there any specific styles or themes you would like the histogram to follow
  (e.g., minimalistic, detailed, corporate)?

  10. Is there a specific way you would like significant outliers to be marked (e.g.,
  different color, special marker, etc.)?'
