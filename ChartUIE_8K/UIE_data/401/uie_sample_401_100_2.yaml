initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the baby names data. Focus
  on the 'n' (number of occurrences) on the y-axis and the 'year' on the x-axis. Highlight
  points representing specific names such as 'Helen', 'Amanda', and 'Betty'. Include
  text annotations for these highlighted points to show the 'prop' (proportion) value.
  The purpose of this visualization is to see how the popularity of these names changes
  over time. This helps in understanding naming trends over years and identifying
  peaks in name popularity. Highlighting and annotating key names will make these
  trends more evident.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Should the highlighted names (''Helen'', ''Amanda'', ''Betty'') have specific
  colors or markers?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations of the ''prop''
  values?

  5. Would you like to include a legend in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have a specific title or subtitle for the scatter plot in mind?

  7. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., any particular wording
  or units)?

  8. Are there any specific requirements for the axis ranges or scaling (e.g., logarithmic
  scale)?

  9. Do you want any background patterns or images on the chart?

  10. Should the plot include additional data points beyond ''Helen'', ''Amanda'',
  and ''Betty'', or focus solely on these names?'
