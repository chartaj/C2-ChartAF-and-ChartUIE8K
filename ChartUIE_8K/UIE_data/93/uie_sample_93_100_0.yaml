initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the world population growth from
  1951 onwards using the provided data. Highlight years with significant yearly growth
  percentages. Use text annotations to display the population figures at key points,
  illustrating major trends and milestones. Ensure the X-axis represents the years
  and the Y-axis represents the population in billions. Differentiate yearly growth
  rates with varying shades or colors to emphasize changes over decades. This will
  help us understand historical population trends and growth patterns, which is crucial
  for social science studies and policy-making. Please focus on making the chart clear
  and visually informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for specific color schemes or palettes for
  differentiating yearly growth rates?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines to enhance readability?

  3. How would you prefer significant yearly growth percentages to be highlighted
  (e.g., with markers, different colors, or shapes)?

  4. Do you have a desired font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the population figures be displayed at specific intervals or only at key
  milestones?

  6. Would you prefer a legend that explains the varying shades or colors representing
  different growth rates?

  7. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying population figures (e.g.,
  with commas, in scientific notation, or without formatting)?

  8. How detailed should the X-axis and Y-axis labels be (e.g., every year, every
  decade)?

  9. Do you have a preference for the placement of text annotations (e.g., above the
  data points, below, or to the side)?

  10. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle? If yes, do you have a specific
  title or subtitle in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like the chart to include gridlines to enhance readability.

  3. I would prefer significant yearly growth percentages to be highlighted with markers
  and different colors.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. The population figures should be displayed at key milestones.

  6. Yes, I would prefer a legend that explains the varying shades or colors representing
  different growth rates.

  7. With commas.

  8. Every decade for the X-axis and detailed enough for the Y-axis to show clear
  trends.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, the chart should include a title. I do not have a specific title in mind.'
