initial_prompt: "Please create a bar chart visualizing world population growth from\
  \ 1951 to 1953. The x-axis should represent the years, and the y-axis should represent\
  \ the population in billions. \nInclude text annotations for each bar to display\
  \ the exact population number. Use highlights to emphasize the yearly growth percentage\
  \ and density values, differentiating them by color or size. This will help viewers\
  \ easily identify and compare growth patterns over the years. The purpose is to\
  \ provide a clear visual representation of how the global population has changed,\
  \ highlighting key trends for social science analysis."
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the highlights (yearly growth percentage and density values)
  to be differentiatedâ€”by color, size, or some other method?

  3. Would you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the text annotations?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles?

  5. Are there specific data points or trends that you want to be particularly emphasized?

  6. Do you have a preference for the position of the text annotations (e.g., inside
  or outside the bars)?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart to help with readability? If so, should
  they be major, minor, or both?

  8. Are there any specific gaps or intervals you prefer between the bars on the chart?

  9. Do you require any additional contextual information or notes to be included
  in the visual?

  10. Is there a preferred title for the chart that you would like to have?'
