initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the data from '93.csv'. I would like
  the x-axis to represent the "Year" and the y-axis to represent the "Population".
  Please plot the population over the years to visualize the growth trend. Also, if
  possible, include a secondary line on the same graph to show "Yearly Growth %" over
  the years for comparison. This will help in visualizing both the absolute population
  numbers and the growth rate together. Please ensure both axes are labeled appropriately
  and add a legend to distinguish between the two lines. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing "Population"
  and "Yearly Growth %"?

  2. What style of line (solid, dashed, dotted) would you like for each of the lines?

  3. Would you prefer any specific markers (circles, squares, etc.) at the data points
  on the lines?

  4. Is there a specific range you would like the y-axes to cover?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability? If yes, in what
  style?

  6. Do you have a preference for the location of the legend on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  8. Do you require any annotations or highlights on the chart to indicate specific
  years or data points?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure; you can choose what looks best.

  3. I do not know; any markers that make the data points clear are fine.

  4. I am not sure about the range for the y-axes.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be helpful, but I am not sure about the style.

  6. I do not have a preference for the location of the legend.

  7. I do not know; any readable font style and size are fine.

  8. I am not sure; you can decide if any annotations are necessary.'
