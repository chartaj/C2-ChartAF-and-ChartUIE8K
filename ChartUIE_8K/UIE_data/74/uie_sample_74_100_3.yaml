initial_prompt: Create a world map choropleth visualization showcasing global cybersecurity
  performance using the provided data. Highlight countries by their "CEI" (Cybersecurity
  Exposure Index) values. Ensure higher CEI values are represented by darker shades.
  Additionally, implement tooltips displaying each countryâ€™s "Country," "Region,"
  "CEI," "GCI," "NCSI," and "DDL" details when hovered over. This visualization will
  help identify regional security trends and vulnerabilities in a visually compelling
  way. Ensure the map is interactive and user-friendly to accommodate a broad audience,
  including those with minimal technical background.
