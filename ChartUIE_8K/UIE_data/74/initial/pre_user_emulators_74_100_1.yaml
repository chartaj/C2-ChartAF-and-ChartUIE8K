2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a stacked column chart that compares the cybersecurity indexes (CEI, GCI,
  NCSI, DDL) across different countries and regions. Highlight countries with missing
  values for a more informative overview. Display detailed annotations only for significant
  countries to emphasize their cybersecurity performance. Utilize highlights to distinguish
  regions, and vary colors to represent different indexes. This visualization helps
  to quickly grasp which regions lead or lag in cybersecurity and identify areas requiring
  attention. Focus on providing clear context and drawing attention to key elements
  using annotations and visual highlights.
