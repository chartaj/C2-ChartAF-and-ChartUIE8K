initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize cybersecurity index trends
  for different countries and regions. Include annotations for specific points to
  highlight key insights, such as data-driven values for countries with extreme index
  scores. Use highlights to distinguish between regions and different indexes (CEI,
  GCI, NCSI, and DDL) by color or line style. The chart should focus on any notable
  fluctuations, trends, and outliers in the data from 74.csv for clearer comparison
  and analysis. The aim is to identify patterns in cybersecurity readiness globally.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette to distinguish
  between regions and indexes?

  2. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to highlight or focus
  on?

  3. Do you have a preferred line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for distinguishing
  between different indexes?

  4. Are there particular points in time you would like to see annotated with key
  insights?

  5. Would you prefer labels for the axes (e.g., ''Time'' for x-axis, ''Index Score''
  for y-axis) to be in a specific format or style?

  6. Is there a specific range or scale you would like to set for the y-axis?

  7. Would you like a legend to identify different regions and indexes? If so, do
  you have preferences for its placement on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the background or gridlines of the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette, please choose one that makes the
  distinctions clear.

  2. I would like to highlight the United States, China, Estonia, and India.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the line style, use whatever makes the
  chart easy to understand.

  4. Key insights from 2010, 2015, and 2020 would be good to annotate.

  5. I prefer labels for the axes in a simple format; ''Time'' for the x-axis and
  ''Index Score'' for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure about the y-axis range or scale, please set it as needed to best
  display the data.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I do not have a specific preference for its placement;
  please position it where it is most readable.

  8. I do not know about specific fonts or text sizes; standard sizes are fine.

  9. I have no specific requirements for the background or gridlines, keep them simple
  and clear.'
