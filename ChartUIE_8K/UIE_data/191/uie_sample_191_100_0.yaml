initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the brain tumor dataset. Highlight
  the Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for each Class. Use different colors
  for each Class to differentiate them visually. Add text annotations to show the
  exact values of Mean, Variance, and Standard Deviation for selected samples to draw
  attention. Ensure the chart clearly shows the distribution and variability within
  each class, aiding in understanding differences. This visualization will help in
  comparing the statistical measures in the health-related brain tumor dataset. Add
  Skewness and Kurtosis as additional comparative elements in the background.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each Class?

  2. Would you like the columns to be displayed side by side or stacked?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Do you prefer the Skewness and Kurtosis to be displayed as lines or markers in
  the background?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales for the y-axis that you would like to
  apply?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific samples within each Class? If so, which
  ones?

  7. How do you prefer Skewness and Kurtosis to be labeled in the chart?

  8. Do you have any particular preferences for the chart title or axis labels?

  9. Are there any gridlines or background elements you wish to include or exclude
  from the chart?

  10. Would you like a legend to differentiate the color coding of the Classes? If
  yes, where should it be placed?'
