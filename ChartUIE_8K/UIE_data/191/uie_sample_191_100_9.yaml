initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart to visualize the brain tumor dataset.
  Specifically, I want the chart to compare various attributes such as Mean, Variance,
  Standard Deviation, Entropy, Skewness, Kurtosis, Contrast, Energy, ASM, Homogeneity,
  Dissimilarity, Correlation, and Coarseness for different classes. Use sample data
  points for "Image1," "Image2," and "Image3" in your comparison. Highlight the differences
  to help understand the variations and patterns in health and tumor images. This
  visualization will aid in identifying distinguishing features of brain tumors effectively.
questions: '1. What color schemes do you prefer for the radar chart to distinguish
  between "Image1," "Image2," and "Image3"?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed)
  for each image on the radar chart?

  3. Should each attribute axis be uniformly scaled, or do you prefer a logarithmic
  scale for better visualization of certain attributes?

  4. Would you like data points to be marked on the radar chart, and if so, what style
  of markers do you prefer (e.g., dots, squares)?

  5. Do you want to include labels for each axis on the radar chart, or would you
  prefer an uncluttered look without labels?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where do you prefer it to be placed
  (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  8. Do you need any specific annotations or notes to be included on the chart to
  highlight key differences or points of interest?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Uniformly scaled axes are fine.

  4. Yes, data points marked with dots would be great.

  5. Yes, please include labels for each axis.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, include a legend at the bottom-left.

  8. I do not know.'
