initial_prompt: Create a radar chart comparing 'Mean,' 'Variance,' 'Standard Deviation,'
  'Entropy,' 'Skewness,' 'Kurtosis,' 'Contrast,' 'Energy,' 'ASM,' 'Homogeneity,' 'Dissimilarity,'
  and 'Correlation' between Class 0 and Class 1 from the given brain tumor health
  dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the radar chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each axis in the radar chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  6. Would you like data points to be marked on the radar chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart''s title or subtitle?
