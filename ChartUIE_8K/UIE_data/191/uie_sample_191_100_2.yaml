initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize the brain tumor dataset.
  The chart should plot Mean on the x-axis and Standard Deviation on the y-axis. Each
  bubble should represent an image, with its size indicating the Energy value. Use
  different colors to distinguish between the two classes (0 and 1). Add text annotations
  to highlight the images with the highest and lowest Contrast values. The purpose
  of this visualization is to analyze the distribution and relationship of these features,
  emphasizing variations and patterns crucial for health evaluations.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for distinguishing between the two
  classes (0 and 1)?

  2. Would you like a title for the chart? If yes, please provide the desired title.

  3. Do you prefer any specific axis labels for the x-axis (Mean) and y-axis (Standard
  Deviation)?

  4. Is there any particular font style or size you would like for text annotations
  and labels?

  5. Should the size of the bubbles representing the Energy value be scaled in a specific
  way?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to explain the different classes and bubble sizes?

  7. Is there any specific format you prefer for displaying the values of Mean, Standard
  Deviation, and Energy (e.g., number of decimal places)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines or background of the chart?

  9. Should the chart include axis ticks and if so, do you have preferences for their
  intervals?'
