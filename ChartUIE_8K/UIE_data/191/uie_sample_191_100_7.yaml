initial_prompt: I want a line chart visualizing the variance, standard deviation,
  and contrast of brain tumor images over different samples. The X-axis should represent
  the image samples, while the Y-axis should reflect the respective values for variance,
  standard deviation, and contrast. Use different colors or styles to distinguish
  each parameter on the chart. Ensure the chart clearly highlights differences between
  Class 0 and Class 1. As the dataset relates to health, the visualization should
  be clean and easily interpretable for medical professionals.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing variance,
  standard deviation, and contrast?

  2. Would you prefer any particular line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for
  differentiating the parameters on the chart?

  3. Should specific markers be used for each data point? If so, what types of markers
  would you prefer (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend detailing the line styles and colors
  used for each parameter?

  5. Is there a specific font or font size you prefer for the labels on the X-axis
  and Y-axis?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, do you have any preferences for their
  appearance (e.g., color, line style)?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the chart''s background color or theme
  (e.g., light, dark)?

  8. Is there additional information or annotations you would like to highlight within
  the chart to aid interpretation?

  9. Would you prefer a specific arrangement or grouping of the data for Class 0 and
  Class 1 in the visualization?

  10. Are there any other specific design elements or features you wish to include
  in the visualization for better readability and clarity?'
