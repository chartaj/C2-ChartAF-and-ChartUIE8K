initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart for visualizing the brain tumor
  dataset. I want to compare the 'Mean', 'Variance', 'Standard Deviation', 'Entropy',
  'Contrast', and 'Energy' across the two classes (0 and 1). Group the data based
  on the 'Class' column and plot the mentioned parameters side by side for each class.
  The x-axis should have the parameters and the y-axis should show their values. Each
  bar group should represent the Classes for visual comparison of these features in
  brain tumor analysis. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  the two classes?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show exact values?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should the y-axis be on a linear scale or a logarithmic scale?

  5. Do you want gridlines in the background for better readability? If so, should
  they be light or bold?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the statistical parameters
  to appear on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which color represents each class?

  8. Should the chart include error bars to show variability or confidence intervals?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the bar width and spacing between bar groups?

  10. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the chart? If so, please specify
  the text.'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include data labels on the bars.

  3. I do not have any specific preference.

  4. Linear scale is fine.

  5. Yes, include gridlines. Light would be better.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Yes, please add a title: "Comparison of Statistical Parameters in Brain Tumor
  Dataset Across Classes"'
