initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart highlighting 'Mean' and 'Variance' for brain
  tumor images. Annotate key high variance points to focus attention. Use different
  color bubbles for each 'Class' to distinguish between benign and malignant tumors.
  Visualize and analyze the significant features effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for distinguishing between
  benign and malignant tumors?

  2. How would you prefer to display annotations for high variance points (e.g., labels,
  tooltips, or highlighted markers)?

  3. Are there any specific size preferences for the bubbles based on variance or
  another attribute?

  4. Would you like a legend to differentiate the classes visually, or do you prefer
  using other distinguishing marks?

  5. Do you have any preferred axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for ''Mean''
  and ''Variance''?

  6. Is there a specific title or label format you would like for the chart and its
  axes?

  7. Are there any additional features or attributes you would like to see included
  in the visualization?'
