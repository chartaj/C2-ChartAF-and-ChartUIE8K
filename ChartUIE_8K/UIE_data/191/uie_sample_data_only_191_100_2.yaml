  The chart should plot Mean on the x-axis and Standard Deviation on the y-axis. Each
  bubble should represent an image, with its size indicating the Energy value. Use
  different colors to distinguish between the two classes (0 and 1). Add text annotations
  to highlight the images with the highest and lowest Contrast values. The purpose
