initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for brain tumor data visualization. Use
  the 'Class' column to differentiate between tumor-present and tumor-absent images.
  For each class, depict histograms of 'Mean', 'Variance', 'Standard Deviation', 'Entropy',
  'Skewness', 'Kurtosis', 'Contrast', 'Energy', 'ASM', 'Homogeneity', and 'Dissimilarity'.
  This will help in understanding the distribution of these attributes for each class.
  Use separate histograms side by side for better comparison. Ensure the x-axis represents
  the metric values and the y-axis represents the frequency count.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing the tumor-present
  and tumor-absent classes?

  2. Would you like any specific titles or labels for each histogram?

  3. Do you require any specific formatting for the axes labels or legend?

  4. Is there a preferred font type or size for the text in the chart?

  5. Do you need gridlines to be displayed on the histograms? If so, specify the style.

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or markers on the histograms?

  7. Do you have a preference for the bin size or the number of bins for the histograms?

  8. Should the histograms include normalization (e.g., probability density instead
  of frequency count)?

  9. Would you like any statistical information (e.g., mean, median) to be displayed
  on the histograms?

  10. Is there a specific order in which you would like the metrics to be displayed?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer standard formatting for the axes labels and legend.

  4. I do not have a preference for font type or size.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a preference for the bin size or number of bins.

  8. No, frequency count is fine.

  9. I do not know.

  10. There is no specific order for displaying the metrics.'
