initial_prompt: Create a column chart showing the Mean and Standard Deviation of brain
  tumor images. Add text annotations to highlight key values for each image class
  and use color highlights to differentiate between classes.
questions: '1. What specific colors would you like to use to differentiate between
  the image classes?

  2. Do you have a preference for the orientation or placement of the text annotations

  3. How would you like to handle overlapping text annotations if multiple key values
  need to be highlighted?

  4. Do you prefer any specific style for the column chart (e.g., 3D, flat, gradient
  fills)?

  5. Would you like to include any legends or labels to describe the color highlights?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font size and style for the text annotations
  and axis labels?

  7. Is there a specific order in which the image classes should be displayed on the
  chart?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reading of the values?

  9. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for mean or standard deviation values
  that you want highlighted or emphasized differently?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart title or axis titles?'
