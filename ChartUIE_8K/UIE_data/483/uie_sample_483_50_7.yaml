initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the proportion of GHG Emissions
  from different milk alternatives (Almond, Oat, Rice) using values from GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks) column in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Do you prefer to display the actual GHG emission values or just the percentages?

  3. How would you like to label the segments (e.g., inside the chart, outside the
  chart, legend)?

  4. Should the chart display a title? If yes, do you have a specific title in mind?

  5. Do you have any specific style preferences for the chart labels (e.g., font size,
  bold, italic)?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or descriptions for each
  segment?

  7. Do you want to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed (e.g.,
  top, bottom, right, left)?

  8. Should the donut chart include a hole at the center, and if so, what should be
  displayed there (e.g., total value, any specific text)?

  9. Are there any specific aspects where you want to maintain consistency with previous
  charts or reports?'
