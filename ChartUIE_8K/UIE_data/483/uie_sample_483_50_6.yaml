initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl
  CC feedbacks)' for 'Almond milk', 'Oat milk', and 'Rice milk'. Show 'Data S2 Name'
  on x-axis and 'GHG Emissions' on y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bars?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. Do you want to include any specific labels or annotations on the bars?

  4. Should the y-axis start at zero, or should it be adjusted to better show the
  differences between the values?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, even though there are only three milk types?

  7. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be on both x and y axes
  or just one of them?

  8. Should there be any specific information on the title of the chart or a subtitle?

  9. Do you want the exact values displayed on top of the bars?

  10. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio that you prefer for the chart?'
