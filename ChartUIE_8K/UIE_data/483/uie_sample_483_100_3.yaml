initial_prompt: '"Please create a box chart using the data from ''../Extra_datas/data/483.csv''.
  I want to visualize the distribution of ''GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl
  CC feedbacks)'' for different types of milk alternatives. Use ''Data S2 Name'' as
  the category for the x-axis and ''GHG Emissions'' for the y-axis. The chart should
  help compare the greenhouse gas emissions across different milk products, which
  is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of these alternatives. Please
  label the axes clearly and ensure each product type is easily distinguishable."'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should certain milk alternatives be highlighted or emphasized in the chart?

  3. How detailed do you want the axis labels and tick marks to be?

  4. Do you prefer the data points to be shown as individual dots on the box chart?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you want to include any statistical annotations like mean or median lines
  on the box chart?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background and gridline styles?

  9. Would you like a legend to distinguish different product types, and if so, where
  should it be placed?

  10. Are there any additional labels or annotations you would like to be included
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. The axis labels and tick marks should be clear and easily readable.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, include a title. It should be "GHG Emissions of Different Milk Alternatives".

  6. Yes, please include mean lines on the box chart.

  7. I do not have any specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, please include a legend, and place it at the bottom of the chart.

  10. I do not have any additional labels or annotations in mind.'
