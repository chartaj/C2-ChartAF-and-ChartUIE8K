initial_prompt: Please create an area chart visualizing the environmental impact of
  different plant-based milks. The chart should include Almond milk, Oat milk, and
  Rice milk. Plot the x-axis with "Data S2 Name" and the y-axis with metrics such
  as "Land Use (m2*year)", "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)",
  "Acidification (g SO2eq)", and "Water Use (L)" to show their respective environmental
  impacts. Different colors should represent each metric. Additionally, highlight
  biodiversity impact with a secondary y-axis for "Biodiversity (sp*yr*10^14)".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different metrics?

  2. Do you want to display data labels on the chart for better clarity?

  3. Is there a particular order in which you want the plant-based milks to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axes have specific ranges, or should they be auto-scaled based on
  the data?

  5. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart to enhance readability?

  6. Is there any specific formatting for the axis titles or tick labels that you
  would like to include?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to identify the different metrics?

  8. Do you have any preference for the line style or marker style for the highlighted
  biodiversity impact on the secondary y-axis?

  9. Would you like to include any explanatory notes or annotations on the chart?'
