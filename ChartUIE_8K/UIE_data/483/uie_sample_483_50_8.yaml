initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the environmental impact of different
  milk alternatives. Use columns like 'Land Use', 'GHG Emissions', 'Water Use', and
  'Biodiversity' for comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display values within the cells?

  3. Do you prefer a specific range for the colors (min-max values) to be used in
  the heatmap?

  4. Would you like a title and axis labels for the heatmap? If yes, please specify.

  5. Should the data be normalized before creating the heatmap?

  6. Do you want to include any annotations or additional information on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, add a title and axis labels, but I have no specific preference for what
  they should say.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.'
