  Create a stacked column chart showing the environmental impacts of different milk
  alternatives. Use ''Data S2 Name'' as the category axis, and the stacked bars should
  represent values for ''Land Use (m2*year)'', ''GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013

  to highlight which milk alternative has the highest and lowest ''Land Use'' and
  ''GHG Emissions''. The purpose is to compare the sustainability impacts of various
  milk options for better decision-making.
