initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart comparing different plant-based milks. Use 'GHG
  Emissions (kg CO2eq)' for the x-axis, 'Land Use (m2*year)' for the y-axis, and 'Water
  Use (L)' for the bubble size.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles or background?

  2. Would you like the bubbles to be labeled with the names of the plant-based milks?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  4. Should the axes have specific ranges or scales (e.g., logarithmic scale)?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Do you prefer any specific bubble opacity settings to allow for better visual
  distinction?

  8. Is there a particular chart title or axis titles you would like to use?

  9. Do you want to include tooltips or annotations for additional data context?

  10. Are there any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for better
  readability?'
