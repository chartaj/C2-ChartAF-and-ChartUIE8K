initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to compare different types of milk (Almond
  milk, Oat milk, Rice milk) in terms of their environmental impact: Land Use, Biodiversity,
  GHG Emissions, Acidification, Eutrophication, and Water Use. Highlight the bars
  for each type of milk in different colors for visual distinction. Include data-driven
  text annotations to show exact values on top of the bars, especially emphasizing
  the categories with the highest and lowest impact values. This visualization helps
  in understanding the sustainability of different milk alternatives.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you would like to use for each type of
  milk?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order in which the milk types are displayed
  on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific layout or design theme you would like the chart to follow?

  6. Would you like the bars to be displayed with a specific width or spacing between
  them?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have a title or legend, and if so, what should they
  be?

  8. Are there any specific data labels you want to be highlighted or emphasized more
  than others?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the order of milk types.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the chart should have a title "Environmental Impact of Different Milk Types"
  and a legend for clarity.

  8. Please highlight the bars with the highest and lowest impact values across all
  categories.'
