initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of "Water Use (L)"
  and "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for different "Original_Food"
  categories. This plot should help us understand the spread and central tendency
  for water usage and greenhouse gas emissions across different types of food products,
  such as Almond milk, Oat milk, and Rice milk. This will assist in comparing the
  environmental impacts of various foods. Make sure to differentiate between the two
  metrics with distinct colors within the same plot for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between ''Water
  Use'' and ''GHG Emissions''?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations for better clarity?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order of the ''Original_Food'' categories on
  the x-axis?

  4. Should we include any additional statistical information, such as median or quantiles,
  within the violin plot?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style for the plot, such as minimalist or detailed?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used for different metrics?
  If so, any preferred position for the legend?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the plot titles or axis labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include median lines within the violin plot.

  5. I prefer a detailed style for the plot.

  6. Yes, please include a legend, and I have no specific preference for its position.

  7. I have no specific requirements for the plot titles or axis labels.'
