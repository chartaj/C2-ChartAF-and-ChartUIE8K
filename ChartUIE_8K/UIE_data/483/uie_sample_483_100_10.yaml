initial_prompt: 'I need a pie chart that shows the proportion of GHG Emissions in
  kg CO2eq for Almond milk, Oat milk, and Rice milk. The data is taken from "GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for each of the milk types: Almond milk,
  Oat milk, and Rice milk. Please make it clear which portion of the chart corresponds
  to each type of milk.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?
