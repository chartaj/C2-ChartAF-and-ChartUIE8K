initial_prompt: Create a violin plot comparing GHG Emissions and Water Use across
  Almond milk, Oat milk, and Rice milk. Use 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl
  CC feedbacks)' and 'Water Use (L)' as data columns. Analyze the impact of each milk
  product.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different milk products in
  the violin plot?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels, titles, or annotations on the
  axes and data points?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the background and gridlines of the plot?

  4. Should we include a legend for the different milk products, and if so, where
  should it be placed on the plot?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the GHG Emissions and
  Water Use axes?

  6. Do you need any specific highlights or markers for median values, quartiles,
  or other statistical measures within the violin plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
