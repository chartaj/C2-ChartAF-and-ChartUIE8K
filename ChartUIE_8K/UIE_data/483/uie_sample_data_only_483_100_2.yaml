  Create a grouped bar chart to compare different types of milk (Almond milk, Oat
  milk, Rice milk) in terms of their environmental impact: Land Use, Biodiversity,
  GHG Emissions, Acidification, Eutrophication, and Water Use. Highlight the bars
  for each type of milk in different colors for visual distinction. Include data-driven
