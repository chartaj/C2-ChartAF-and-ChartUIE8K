initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl
  CC feedbacks)' for different milk alternatives (Almond milk, Oat milk, Rice milk).
  Each bar should represent one type of milk. Use the 'Data S2 Name' as the category
  axis and 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)' as the value axis.
  The chart should visually show which milk alternative has the highest and lowest
  greenhouse gas emissions. This will highlight the environmental impact of each alternative
  for a quick and clear comparison in the context of LCA_Ratios_Import and zoology.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels on the bars to show the exact GHG emissions
  values?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed in a particular order (e.g., highest to
  lowest emissions)?

  4. Should we include a title for the chart? If yes, what title would you like?

  5. Do you want to add any specific annotations or notes to highlight the highest
  and lowest emissions?

  6. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart to improve readability?

  7. Should we include a legend, even though each bar represents a different milk
  alternative?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  9. Would you like the bar edges to be rounded or have any special styling?

  10. Do you want the chart to have a specific background color or texture?'
