initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart visualizing the environmental impact of
  different plant-based milks. Use the x-axis for "Data S2 Name" (Almond milk, Oat
  milk, Rice milk) and the y-axis for the following metrics: "Land Use (m2*year)",
  "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)", "Acidification (g SO2eq)",
  "Eutrophication (g PO43-eq)", and "Water Use (L)". Clearly label each line and use
  different colors for each environmental metric for better differentiation. The chart
  should highlight the environmental costs associated with producing each type of
  milk.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  each environmental metric?

  2. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  3. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for axis labels and legend?

  4. Are there any specific requirements for the chart title?

  5. Do you need gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be for both axes or only
  one?

  6. Do you prefer data points to be marked with symbols on the lines?

  7. Should there be a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be placed on
  the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  9. Would you like any particular background color or style for the chart?

  10. Should the chart have any annotations or callouts to highlight specific data
  points?'

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for both axes.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, there should be a legend; please place it at the top right of the chart.
