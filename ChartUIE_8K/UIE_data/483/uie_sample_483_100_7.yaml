initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart displaying the contribution of different
  milk types to GHG emissions (in kg CO2eq), using the column 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq,
  IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)' from the provided data. Each segment should represent
  one type of milk (Almond milk, Oat milk, and Rice milk) with their respective GHG
  emission values. Also, label each segment with both the milk type and its respective
  GHG emission value for clarity. This will help visualize the environmental impact
  of each milk alternative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the segments representing
  each milk type?

  2. Would you like to include a legend in addition to the labels on the segments?

  3. Do you prefer the labels on the segments to be inside or outside the donut chart?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for the labels on the segments?

  5. Should the donut chart include a title? If so, what should it be?

  6. Would you like to display percentage values along with the GHG emission values
  in the labels?

  7. Do you prefer any specific order for the segments (e.g., highest to lowest GHG
  emissions)?

  8. Is there a specific background color you prefer for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the title should be "GHG Emissions of Different Milk Types".

  6. Yes, please include percentage values along with the GHG emission values.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.'
