initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart to visualize the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
  in kg CO2eq (IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks) for different milk types from the provided
  dataset. Use "Data S2 Name" for the category axis and "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq,
  IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for the value axis. This will help compare the environmental
  impact of each milk alternative. Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret,
  highlighting the differences in emissions among the milk types. Additionally, label
  each lollipop with its corresponding GHG value for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lollipop chart?

  2. Would you like the lollipops to have a particular shape or style for the markers?

  3. How would you prefer to have the axis labels styled (font, size, color)?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the milk types to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by emission values)?

  5. Would you like to include a grid in the background for easier interpretation?

  6. Do you prefer any specific styling for the data labels showing GHG values (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to be displayed on
  the chart?

  8. Do you want to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  9. Would you prefer a horizontal or vertical layout for the lollipop chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the shape or style for the markers.

  3. I would prefer readable font sizes and clear, legible colors for the axis labels.

  4. I would like the milk types to be displayed in order of their emission values,
  from lowest to highest.

  5. Yes, including a grid in the background would be helpful.

  6. I do not have any specific preferences for the data labels'' styling.

  7. No specific titles or subtitles are needed, just clear labeling of axes and values.

  8. I do not know about additional annotations or notes.

  9. I do not have a preference between a horizontal or vertical layout.'
