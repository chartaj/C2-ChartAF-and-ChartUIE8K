initial_prompt: Create a radar chart comparing "Almond milk," "Oat milk," and "Rice
  milk" across multiple environmental impact metrics. Use axes for "Land Use," "Arable
  Land Use," "Biodiversity," "GHG Emissions," "Acidification," "Eutrophication," "Water
  Use," and "Scarcity Weighted Water Use." Highlight the highest and lowest values
  in each category to make comparisons easier. Annotate specific data points to emphasize
  significant differences or notable values. This visualization will help environmentally
  conscious consumers assess the ecological footprint of these milk alternatives.
  Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the highest
  and lowest values in each category?

  2. Is there a specific style you prefer for annotating significant data points (e.g.,
  arrows, text labels, markers)?

  3. Would you like any specific font style or size for labels and annotations on
  the radar chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the shape or layout of the radar chart (e.g.,
  circular, polygonal)?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines or background shading for easier interpretation?

  6. Would you like the data points connected with lines, or should each data point
  be individual?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the radar
  chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement or style?

  9. Are there any additional elements you would like to incorporate to make the chart
  clearer or more visually appealing?'
