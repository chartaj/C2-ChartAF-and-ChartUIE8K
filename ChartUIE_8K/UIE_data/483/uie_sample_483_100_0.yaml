initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart showing the environmental impacts of
  different milk alternatives. Use 'Data S2 Name' as the category axis, and the stacked
  bars should represent values for 'Land Use (m2*year)', 'GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq,
  IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)', 'Water Use (L)', and 'Acidification (g SO2eq)'. Add
  annotations to highlight which milk alternative has the highest and lowest 'Land
  Use' and 'GHG Emissions'. The purpose is to compare the sustainability impacts of
  various milk options for better decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the annotations to be placed inside or outside the columns?

  3. Should the y-axis be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  4. Would you like data labels displayed on the bars?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Should each environmental impact category have a distinct color?

  7. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for easier value comparison?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend?

  9. Do you want any specific milk alternatives to be highlighted or emphasized?

  10. Is there a preferred order for displaying the milk alternatives on the category
  axis?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Inside the columns.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, each category should have a distinct color.

  7. Yes, include gridlines.

  8. Yes, include a legend.

  9. I don''t have any specific preferences for highlighting.

  10. I am not sure.'
