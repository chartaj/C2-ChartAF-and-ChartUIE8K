initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of "GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for different types of milk (Almond milk,
  Oat milk, Rice milk) from the given dataset. This will help us compare the greenhouse
  gas emissions associated with each milk alternative. Make sure to label the x-axis
  as "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq)" and the y-axis as "Frequency". Use different colors
  to distinguish between the milk types and include a legend for clarity. This visualization
  is crucial for understanding the environmental impact of different milk products.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  the different types of milk?

  2. What should be the title of the histogram?

  3. Do you prefer grid lines in the background of the histogram for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific font style or font size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you want to include any additional annotations on the histogram to highlight
  key points or findings?

  6. Should the bins of the histogram be equally spaced or based on specific intervals?

  7. Are there any specific design elements or themes you would like the histogram
  to follow (e.g., minimalist, detailed, vibrant)?

  8. Do you have any preference for the orientation of the legend (e.g., right, top,
  bottom, left)?

  9. Would you like to show the distribution as counts or normalized percentages on
  the y-axis?

  10. Are there any particular aspects of the data that you want to be prominently
  highlighted in the histogram?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about the title.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Equally spaced bins would be fine.

  7. I do not have a specific design preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Counts would be fine.

  10. I do not have any particular aspects to highlight.'
