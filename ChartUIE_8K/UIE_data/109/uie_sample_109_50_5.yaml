initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing coffee preferences (like "favorite",
  "additions") across different regions. Use "ethnicity_race" to highlight demographic
  insights. Focus on data like "age" and "education_level" to provide deeper context
  on preferences.
questions: '1. What regions or geographic areas should be highlighted in the choropleth
  map?

  2. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for representing different
  coffee preferences or demographic factors?

  3. Should the map include labels or annotations for key data points or regions?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for demographic data (e.g., state, county,
  city)?

  5. How should different age groups be classified on the map (e.g., 18-24, 25-34,
  etc.)?

  6. Do you want to display all education levels or group them into broader categories
  (e.g., high school, undergraduate, graduate)?

  7. Should the map include a legend to explain the color coding used?

  8. Are there any specific data points or outliers you want to highlight on the map?

  9. Do you prefer the map to have a particular style or theme (e.g., modern, classic,
  professional)?

  10. Should the choropleth map include any interactive elements like tooltips or
  hover effects?'
