initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map highlighting coffee consumption patterns across
  the United States. Use 'age', 'where_drink', and 'total_spend' columns from the
  Great American Coffee Taste Test Dataset. Different color gradients should illustrate
  varying average ages, spending habits, and preferred locations for drinking coffee
  in different states. Include a legend to indicate the scale of spending and age
  ranges. This map will help visualize regional differences in coffee drinking habits
  and spending, aiding businesses in targeting their products effectively. Make sure
  to depict data gaps clearly for areas with insufficient information.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color gradients or palettes in mind for illustrating\
  \ average ages, spending habits, and preferred locations? \n2. What age ranges would\
  \ you like represented in the legend? \n3. What scale of spending would you like\
  \ represented in the legend? \n4. Would you prefer to see state boundaries or regional\
  \ divisions within the map?\n5. Do you have any preference for the visual representation\
  \ of data gaps or areas with insufficient information?\n6. Would you like any specific\
  \ fonts or styles for the map labels and legend? \n7. Are there any particular states\
  \ or regions you would like to emphasize?"
answers: '1. I am not sure, any clear and distinguishable gradients would be fine.

  2. Ages could be grouped into ranges such as 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-60, and 60+.

  3. I do not know, but an indicative range from low to high spenders would be helpful.

  4. I would prefer to see state boundaries.

  5. I have no specific preference, but please make sure it''s clear where data is
  insufficient.

  6. I am not sure about specific fonts or styles, just keep it professional and readable.

  7. I do not have any particular states or regions to emphasize.'
