initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of participants' ages.
  Annotate specific age groups with the highest and lowest counts to highlight key
  demographics. This will help us understand the age-related coffee preferences better.

  groups in the histogram?

  5. Should the axis labels follow a particular format or naming convention?

  6. Would you prefer gridlines to be included for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text and labels in the histogram?

  8. Are there any specific additional demographic categorizations or age groupings
  you''d like to see besides the highest and lowest counts?

  the histogram to make it more informative for the audience?'
