initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the "Video Games Sales" dataset. Plot
  the 'years' on the x-axis and 'global_sales' on the y-axis to visualize the correlation
  between the release year of games and their global sales. Differentiate the points
  by 'genre' using different colors to see how genres influence sales over the years.
  Ensure the scatter points are clearly visible and use a legend for genres. Add axis
  labels "Year" and "Global Sales" for clarity, and a title "Year vs Global Sales
  by Genre." Ensure the plot is easy to read and interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the genres?

  2. Would you like the scatter points to have varying sizes based on another attribute?

  3. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should the chart include data point labels or hover text for specific data points?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  6. Do you want a trend line added to visualize the overall correlation between ''year''
  and ''global_sales''?

  7. Are there any specific years or genres you want to highlight or annotate on the
  chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as average
  global sales per genre over the years?'
