initial_prompt: '<start of user emulated instruction>

  Create a histogram visualization showing the distribution of global sales for video
  games listed in the dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the top three best-selling
  games. Additionally, use highlights to differentiate sales data by region (e.g.,
  NA Sales, EU Sales, JP Sales) for better comparative analysis. The purpose is to
  identify sales trends and regional popularity. Include a legend for clarity. Relevant
  context from the dataset and detailed annotation guidelines should be followed to
  emphasize key data insights.
