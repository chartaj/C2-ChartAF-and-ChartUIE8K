initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the video game sales data over the
  years. Specifically, plot the years on the x-axis and the global sales on the y-axis.
  Different lines should represent different platforms to show the trend of sales
  for each platform over time. Include labels and a legend for clarity. The goal is
  to understand how the sales of games have changed over time across different platforms.
  Include the top five most popular platforms based on unique game counts. This will
  help identify trends and patterns in the video game industry.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  platforms?

  2. Would you prefer a grid in the background to enhance readability?

  3. Should the chart include data point markers in addition to the line?

  4. Do you have any preference for the style of lines (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  6. Do you require any particular axis scaling (e.g., logarithmic) for better visualization
  of trends?

  7. Would you like to include tooltips or annotations for specific data points?'
