initial_prompt: Create a Treemap chart to visualize the global sales of video games.
  Use the 'genre' as the main category and 'publisher' as subcategories within the
  genres. Each block should represent a game, sized by 'global_sales'. Add text annotations
  to highlight the top-selling games in each genre to emphasize their significance.
  Use different colors to distinguish between genres. The purpose is to easily compare
  the sales performance of different publishers and their games across genres and
  regions. This will help identify market trends and major players in the video gaming
  industry.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  genres?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for text annotations?

  3. Would you like to see any additional text information within the blocks representing
  each game, aside from the top-selling games?

  4. What level of detail do you prefer for text annotations in the top-selling games
  (e.g., including sales figures, game names, or both)?

  5. Do you have any specific layout preferences for the Treemap (e.g., aspect ratio,
  padding between blocks)?

  6. Is there a particular color palette you prefer for differentiating between publishers
  within the same genre?'

  genres.

  publishers within the same genre.'
