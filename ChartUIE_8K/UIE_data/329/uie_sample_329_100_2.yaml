initial_prompt: Visualize the SMOC2 gene expression levels in normal and fibrosis
  conditions using a pie chart. Highlight differences between fibrosis and normal
  tissue samples. Annotate significant values to draw attention to key data points,
  enabling easy comparison across conditions. This visualization will help understand
  fibrotic progression and SMOC2’s role. Include proportions from columns of normal
  and fibrosis samples, ensuring the chart is clear and focuses on these comparisons.
  The pie chart serves to provide an intuitive grasp of relative gene expression levels
  across the given samples.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the pie chart to differentiate
  between normal and fibrosis conditions?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend to label each category of gene expression
  levels?

  3. Do you have any specific annotations in mind for highlighting significant values,
  such as specific labels or markers?

  4. Are there any particular thresholds or criteria you consider for a value to be
  significant and highlighted?

  5. How would you prefer the proportions to be displayed—percentage values, absolute
  values, or both?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style for the labels and annotations
  to ensure readability?

  7. Would you like to include any titles or subtitles to provide context for the
  chart?

  8. Do you want the data categories (normal and fibrosis samples) grouped or displayed
  separately in the pie chart?

  9. Should the chart include any grid lines or boundaries for improved visual distinction
  between segments?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the pie chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include a legend to label each category of gene expression levels.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Both percentage and absolute values would be great.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, please include a title that indicates this is about SMOC2 gene expression
  in normal and fibrosis conditions.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No need for grid lines or boundaries.

  10. I do not have any specific dimensions or aspect ratios in mind.'
