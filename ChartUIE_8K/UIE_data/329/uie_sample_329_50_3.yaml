initial_prompt: Can you create a grouped bar chart visualizing the SMOC2 raw counts
  for fibrosis and normal conditions from the given CSV data? Make sure to include

  the X and Y axes.

  4. Is there a particular order in which you would like the conditions (e.g., smoc2_fibrosis1,
  smoc2_normal1) to be displayed?

  5. Do you want to display a legend for the different conditions? If so, do you have
  any preferences for how it should be formatted?

  6. Would you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability?
