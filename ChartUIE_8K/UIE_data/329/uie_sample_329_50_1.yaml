initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing SMOC2 expression levels across different
  conditions (fibrosis and normal). Highlight significant trends or differences. Annotate
  specific data points to emphasize key observations. Include data-driven text annotations
  for clear insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for highlighting different
  conditions (fibrosis vs. normal)?

  2. Would you like specific styles or symbols (e.g., circles, squares) for data points
  to differentiate between conditions?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have preferences on their density or style?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds or benchmarks you would like highlighted on
  the graph (e.g., a horizontal line at a certain expression level)?

  5. Do you prefer annotations to be placed inside the plot area or outside of it,
  connected by lines or arrows?

  6. Would you like the x-axis or y-axis to be logarithmic if there are wide ranges
  in data values?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style or size used for annotations
  and axis labels?

  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  9. Are there specific data points you already know should be annotated for key observations,
  or should this be determined based on significant trends and differences in the
  data?

  10. Would you prefer the lines to be smooth curves or straight connecting lines
  between the data points?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Determine based on significant trends and differences in the data.
