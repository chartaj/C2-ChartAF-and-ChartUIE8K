initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the dataset detailing SMOC2 expression
  across different conditions (fibrosis and normal). Each axis should represent the
  sample type (e.g., smoc2_fibrosis1, smoc2_normal1, etc.), and the data points should
  indicate the raw counts provided. The heatmap should clearly distinguish between
  high and low expression levels using a color gradient. The goal is to visually compare
  the SMOC2 expression across different samples and identify any significant patterns
  or differences. Ensure the heatmap is labeled appropriately for easy interpretation.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or gradient for distinguishing
  between high and low expression levels on the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations on the heatmap for certain data
  points or ranges?

  3. Is there a preferred way you would like the axes to be labeled (e.g., full sample
  names, abbreviated names)?

  4. Do you need a legend to explain the color gradient, and if so, do you have a
  preferred placement for it?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to show any specific statistical information or values
  (e.g., mean expression level, standard deviation)?

  6. Is there a preferred orientation for the heatmap (e.g., samples on the x-axis
  and conditions on the y-axis)?

  7. Are there any specific patterns or differences you are particularly interested
  in highlighting within the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or resolution of the heatmap
  for presentation or publication purposes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; please use a common gradient for
  heatmaps that clearly shows high and low expression levels.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Full sample names would be preferred.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I have no specific preference for its placement.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, samples on the x-axis and conditions (fibrosis, normal) on the y-axis would
  be preferred.

  7. I am specifically interested in highlighting any significant differences in expression
  levels between fibrosis and normal conditions.

  8. I have no specific requirements for size or resolution.'
