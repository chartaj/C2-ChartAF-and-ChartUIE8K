initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the SMOC2 gene counts in different
  fibrosis and normal conditions. Annotate specific data points to highlight differences.
  Emphasize extreme values to show varying expression levels.
questions: '1. Do you have a color preference for the data points representing the
  fibrosis and normal conditions?

  2. What specific labels or annotations would you like to highlight on the scatter
  plot?

  3. Should the axis titles include specific details, or are generic titles like ''Sample''
  and ''SMOC2 Gene Count'' acceptable?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds for extreme values that need to be visually
  emphasized?

  5. Would you like a legend to differentiate between fibrosis and normal conditions?

  6. Do you have a preference for the marker shapes used for fibrosis versus normal
  conditions?

  7. Should any grid lines or reference lines be included in the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title?

  9. Is there a specific range for the x-axis and y-axis that you would like to be
  set?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like to highlight data points showing extreme values in both conditions.

  3. Generic titles like ''Sample'' and ''SMOC2 Gene Count'' are acceptable.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between fibrosis and normal conditions.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific preferences for the chart title.
