initial_prompt: Create a box plot for the Fibrosis SMOC2 Raw Counts dataset. Include
  separate boxes for each column (smoc2_fibrosis1, smoc2_fibrosis2, smoc2_fibrosis3,
  smoc2_fibrosis4, smoc2_normal1, smoc2_normal3, smoc2_normal4). The x-axis should
  represent the different conditions, and the y-axis should represent the raw counts.
  Ensure the plot clearly shows the distribution, median, quartiles, and any potential
  outliers for each condition. Use appropriate labels and titles to make the chart
  easily understandable.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette of the box
  plot to differentiate between fibrosis and normal conditions?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the plot for better readability of
  data points?

  3. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  4. Do you require any additional annotations on the chart, such as sample size or
  statistical summary?

  5. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plot?

  6. Should the y-axis have a logarithmic scale or remain linear?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?

  8. Do you want to customize the appearance of outliers, such as using different
  markers or colors?

  9. Would you like to include any additional descriptive statistics on the plot,
  such as mean or standard deviation?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels?'
