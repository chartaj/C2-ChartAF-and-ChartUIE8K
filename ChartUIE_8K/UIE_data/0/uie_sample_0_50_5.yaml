initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for the Crop Recommendation Dataset. Specifically,
  plot histograms for the distributions of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium
  (K) levels. Ensure each histogram is clearly labeled and shows the frequency of
  each nutrient level to help visualizing nutrient distribution in various crops.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. How many bins would you like to have for each histogram?

  3. Should the histograms have grid lines for better readability?

  4. Would you like to include a title for each histogram? If so, please specify.

  5. Do you have a preferred font type and size for the labels and titles?

  6. Should the histograms include legends, and if so, what should they display?

  7. Do you prefer the histograms to be displayed in a single row, column, or in a
  grid layout?

  8. Are there any specific axis ranges you would like for the histograms? If so,
  please specify.

  9. Would you like descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median) to be included on
  the histograms?

  10. Is there any additional information or annotations you would like to be included
  in the histograms?'
