initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between
  temperature and humidity across different crops in the Crop Recommendation Dataset.
  Each point should represent a specific measurement, colored by crop type. This will
  help in understanding how these two variables vary together for different crops,
  aiding in better crop recommendations. Use distinct colors for each crop label to
  clearly differentiate them on the scatter plot. Add axis labels and a legend for
  clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different crop types?

  2. Is there a specific size you prefer for the data points in the scatter plot?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  6. Should the axis labels include specific units of measurement (e.g., ''Â°C'' for
  temperature and ''%'' for humidity)?

  7. Do you want trend lines or regression lines included in the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any specific markers you prefer for data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  9. Would you like to include a title for the scatter plot?

  10. Is there a preferred range for the axes that you want to be set?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Top-right, please.

  6. Yes, please include the units of measurement.

  7. No, I do not need trend lines or regression lines.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include a title: "Temperature vs. Humidity Across Different Crops".

  10. I do not have a preferred range for the axes.'
