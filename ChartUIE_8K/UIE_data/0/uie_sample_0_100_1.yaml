initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the Crop Recommendation Dataset. The heatmap
  should visualize the relationship between the various nutrients (N, P, K), temperature,
  humidity, pH, and rainfall with the crop labels. This will help identify optimal
  conditions for each type of crop. Use text annotations to highlight specific data
  points like maximum, minimum values, or any anomalies. Apply highlights where necessary
  to distinguish critical values or patterns, ensuring they stand out for easier interpretation.
  This visualization will aid farmers in understanding the best conditions for different
  crops, enhancing agricultural decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a gradient or discrete colors to represent different ranges
  of values?

  3. Are there specific crops or nutrients you want to focus on?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to display grid lines for better separation of cells?

  5. Should the text annotations for maximum, minimum values, and anomalies be highlighted
  in a specific color or format?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the font style or size for annotations
  and labels?

  7. Should the heatmap have a legend explaining the color gradients or discrete colors
  used?

  8. Would you like to include axis labels and titles for better understanding?

  9. Do you prefer a particular layout for the heatmap (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  orientation)?

  10. Are there any specific critical values or patterns you want to ensure are highlighted
  distinctly?'
