initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing average N, P, K values for different
  crops. Highlight the 'rice' values with distinct colors. Include text annotations
  for crops 'rice' and 'wheat,' displaying their average N, P, K values. This helps
  compare nutrient needs of various crops effectively.
