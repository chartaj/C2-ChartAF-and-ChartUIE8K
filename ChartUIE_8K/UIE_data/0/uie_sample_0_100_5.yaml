initial_prompt: I have a dataset about crop recommendations with various agricultural
  parameters. I want to visualize the distribution of nutrient levels in the soil,
  focusing on Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K). Please create a histogram
  for each of these three nutrients. The histograms should show the frequency of different
  concentration levels of N, P, and K across all samples. Ensure each histogram is
  labeled properly with axis titles and has a suitable color for each nutrient. This
  will help in understanding the nutrient distribution for different crops. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for each nutrient (N, P, K)?

  2. What titles would you like for each histogram?

  3. Do you want to include grid lines in the histograms?

  4. Should the histograms have a specific layout (e.g., side-by-side or stacked)?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to include a legend for the histograms?

  7. Do you have specific axis ranges in mind for the nutrient levels?

  8. Are there any specific bin sizes you prefer for the histograms?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Titles can be "Distribution of Nitrogen Levels", "Distribution of Phosphorus
  Levels", and "Distribution of Potassium Levels".

  3. Yes, please include grid lines.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.'
