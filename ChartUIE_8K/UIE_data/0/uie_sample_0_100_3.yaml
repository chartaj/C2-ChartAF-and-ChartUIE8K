initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to visualize the Crop Recommendation Dataset.
  The chart should use 'temperature' on the x-axis and 'humidity' on the y-axis. Each
  bubble should represent a unique crop type (from the 'label' column), with the bubble
  size determined by the average 'rainfall' for that crop. I want each bubble to be
  color-coded according to the 'label' for easy distinction. This will help me understand
  the correlation between temperature, humidity, and different crop types.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bubbles representing
  different crop types?

  2. What scale would you prefer for the axes (linear or logarithmic)?

  3. Do you want any specific labels or annotations on the bubbles or axes?

  4. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific title or subtitle you want to include in the chart?

  6. Is there a preferred size range for the bubbles?

  7. Would you like to display a legend explaining the bubble colors and sizes?

  8. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the text in the chart?

  9. Should the chart background be a specific color or remain white?

  10. Would you like to include any trend lines or reference lines to help highlight
  correlations?'
