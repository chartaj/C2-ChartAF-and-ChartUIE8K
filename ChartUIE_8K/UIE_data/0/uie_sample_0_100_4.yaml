initial_prompt: 'I need a line chart for a crop recommendation dataset. Please plot
  the following variables against the label: temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.
  Use different colors for each variable line to distinguish them easily. The x-axis
  should represent the different types of crops (labels), while the y-axis should
  display the values of temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. This visualization
  will help in understanding how these environmental factors vary across different
  crops. Keep the chart clean and well-labeled for easy interpretation. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for each variable line (temperature,
  humidity, pH, rainfall)?

  2. What font size and style do you prefer for the axis labels and chart title?

  3. Do you want grid lines in the background for easier value tracing? If so, should
  they be dashed or solid?

  4. Should each variable line have specific markers (e.g., circles, squares) at data
  points, or should it be a simple line?

  5. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the lines representing each variable?

  6. Would you like to see a legend indicating which color corresponds to which variable,
  and if so, where should it be placed (top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights for certain data points or
  sections of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I would like grid lines in the background. Solid would be preferable.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, I would like to see a legend indicating which color corresponds to which
  variable, placed at the bottom.

  7. I am not sure.'
