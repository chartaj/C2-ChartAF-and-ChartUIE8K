initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize bird collisions over time, highlighting
  genus and species trends. Annotate significant data points to emphasize key patterns
  related to habitat and family. Include context for bird flight calls.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to distinguish between
  different genera and species?

  2. Should the x-axis be labeled with specific date intervals (e.g., monthly, yearly)?

  3. Would you like to use different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) to differentiate
  between genus and species?

  4. How would you like significant data points to be annotated (e.g., with labels,
  markers)?

  5. Do you prefer to group the data by family and habitat using color coding or another
  visual cue?

  6. Should we display a legend to explain the color scheme and line styles?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for the context related to bird flight
  calls (e.g., tooltips, side notes)?

  8. Are there any specific date ranges or time periods you would like to emphasize?

  9. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their style and color?'
