initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart showing the number of unique species
  observed per genus in different habitats. Each bar will represent a genus, and the
  segments will represent distinct habitats such as Open, Forest, and Urban.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing different habitats
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the genus names to be displayed vertically or horizontally on
  the x-axis?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify the different habitats?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines for easier comparison across genera?

  5. Is there a specific ordering of genera that you prefer (e.g., alphabetical, by
  number of species)?

  6. Would you like to display the exact number of unique species on each segment
  of the bars?

  7. Should the y-axis show the number of species in intervals (e.g., 0, 10, 20) or
  as a continuous scale?

  8. Do you want to include axis titles and, if so, what should they be?

  9. Is there any specific font style or size preference for the labels and titles?

  10. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed with any specific width or spacing between
  them?'
