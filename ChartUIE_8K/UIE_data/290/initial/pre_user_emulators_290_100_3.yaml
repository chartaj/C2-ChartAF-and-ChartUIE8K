- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.   \n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Bar chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Bar chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a bar chart visualizing the number of unique species within each genus
  from the bird collisions dataset. The chart should help us understand which genera
  have the highest species diversity. Additionally, make sure to highlight the genera
  with the most and least species. This would give us insights into the biodiversity
  present in the dataset.
