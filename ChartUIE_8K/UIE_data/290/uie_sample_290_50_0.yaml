initial_prompt: Visualize bird collision data with a scatter plot. Highlight key genus/species
  points using text annotations. Shape annotations like trend lines and arrows to
  analyze patterns. Focus on flight calls and habitats for deeper insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing different ''flight_call''
  and ''habitat'' categories?

  2. Are there specific genus or species you want to be highlighted with text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preference for the type or style of trend lines (e.g., linear,
  polynomial)?

  4. What format or style do you prefer for arrows used to indicate patterns or trends?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the axes (linear vs. logarithmic)?

  6. Would you prefer any specific markers or shapes to be used for different ''flight_call''
  statuses or ''habitat'' types?

  7. Do you want to include a legend and, if so, where should it be positioned on
  the chart?

  8. Are there any particular date ranges you want to focus on or emphasize in the
  scatter plot?

  9. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text annotations and labels?'
