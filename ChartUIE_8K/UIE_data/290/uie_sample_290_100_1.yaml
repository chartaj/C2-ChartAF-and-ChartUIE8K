initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating bird species recorded over time based
  on the provided bird collision data. Plot the number of unique species on the y-axis
  and dates on the x-axis to showcase trends. Utilize text annotations to highlight
  significant peaks or drops in species counts. Additionally, use shape annotations
  like arrows to point out notable dates or events. This will help in understanding
  patterns in bird collisions, useful for zoology research. Ensure the chart is clear
  and informative, focusing on changes over the years detailed in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the x-axis dates to be formatted in a specific way (e.g., monthly,
  yearly)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  4. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like used in the annotations
  or labels?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for the line (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded from the chart?

  7. How many significant peaks or drops would you like to be annotated?

  8. Do you prefer the shape annotations (e.g., arrows) to have a specific color or
  style?

  9. Is there any additional information you would like to be included in the legend
  or tooltips?'

  2. I am not sure, maybe monthly.

  3. I don''t have any specific preferences.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I think gridlines would be helpful.

  7. Maybe 3-4 significant peaks or drops.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No additional information needed.'
