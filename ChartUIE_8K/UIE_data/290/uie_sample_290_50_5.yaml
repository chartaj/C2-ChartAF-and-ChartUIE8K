initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing bird collisions using the provided
  data. Highlight regions by the number of recorded species. Ensure the map differentiates
  between regions MP and any others. Use color gradients to represent collision density
  across different localities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors for the gradient
  representing collision density?

  2. Would you like specific labeling for the "MP" region to ensure it stands out?

  3. How detailed do you want the legend for the color gradients to be?

  4. Do you have a specific geographic boundary format you prefer (e.g., state, county,
  municipality)?

  5. Should there be any specific annotations or markers for regions with the highest
  and lowest collision densities?

  6. Are there any additional elements you would like to include on the map, such
  as bird species icons or locality names?

  7. Would you prefer a particular style or theme for the map (e.g., classic, modern,
  minimalist)?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the map''s scale or zoom level?

  9. Are there any reference points or landmarks you would like included to help contextualize
  the regions?

  10. Should the chart include any text descriptions or captions to explain the data
  and visual distinctions?'
