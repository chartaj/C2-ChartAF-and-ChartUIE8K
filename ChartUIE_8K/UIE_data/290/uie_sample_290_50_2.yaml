initial_prompt: Create a histogram of bird collisions by year. Add text annotations
  for years with highest collisions. Use shape annotations to highlight trends. Visualize
  by genus and species, with color coding for family. Include context about open habitat
  frequency and flight calls.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the color coding of
  families?

  2. How would you like the shape annotations to highlight trends (e.g., arrows, lines,
  shaded areas)?

  3. What style of text annotations would you prefer for the years with the highest
  collisions (e.g., bold, italic, color)?

  4. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would like to include?

  5. Do you prefer a specific bin width or range for the histogram?

  6. Would you like any specific legends or keys for the colors and shapes used in
  the chart?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations and axis labels?

  8. Are there any specific elements you want to include in the context about open
  habitat frequency and flight calls?

  9. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  10. Is there a preferred order in which the genus and species should be visualized?'
