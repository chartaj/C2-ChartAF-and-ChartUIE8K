initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map visualizing bird collision data, focusing
  on specific attributes. Highlight different bird species' collision frequency across
  various localities. Utilize the 'date' column to distinguish trends over time and
  the 'habitat' to show concentration points. Use distinct colors to represent values
  and patterns. Include interactive elements to explore 'family' and 'stratum' impacts.
  Ensure the map is detailed, with appropriate legends and tooltips. Integrate the
  unique and missing values information for better data accuracy. Provide an informative
  title and relevant labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different bird
  species and habitats?

  2. Is there a specific timeframe you are most interested in for visualizing trends
  over time?

  3. Do you prefer a particular map projection or geographical boundary focus?

  4. Would you like any specific annotations or markers to highlight key data points
  or outliers?

  5. Do you have preferences for the placement or style of legends and labels?

  6. Are there any specific metrics or summary statistics you would like included
  in tooltips?

  7. Should we incorporate any specific icons or shapes to represent family or stratum
  impacts on the map?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the title and other textual elements?'
answers: '1. I am not sure; please use a color palette that best represents the data.

  2. I am most interested in visualizing trends over the last five years.

  3. I have no specific preference; use what best fits the data.

  4. Yes, please highlight key data points or outliers with annotations or markers.

  5. I do not know; please use a conventional style that ensures clarity.

  6. Please include metrics like the total number of collisions, percentage change
  over time, and unique species count in the tooltips.

  7. I am not sure; use icons or shapes if they enhance data clarity and interpretation.

  8. I have no specific preference for layout; ensure the title and textual elements
  are clear and informative.'
