initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the number of unique species
  within each genus from the bird collisions dataset. The chart should help us understand
  which genera have the highest species diversity. Additionally, make sure to highlight
  the genera with the most and least species. This would give us insights into the
  biodiversity present in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the highlighted bars for the genera with the most and least species be
  a specific color?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be ordered by genus name alphabetically or by the number
  of species?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the background to help with readability?

  5. Do you require any specific labels on the axes, such as unit or genus name formatting?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the highlighted bars for the most
  and least species?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  8. Should the chart include data point labels showing the exact number of species
  on each bar?

  9. Do you want the chart title and axis titles to be centered or aligned differently?'
