initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart that compares the GNI (PPP) and
  Life Expectancy at Birth for Korea, Kuwait, Kenya, and Kazakhstan from 2008 to 2010.
  Each column represents a year, and the stacks show the respective GNI and Life Expectancy
  for each country. The x-axis should represent the years, while the y-axis should
  represent the values for GNI (use a secondary y-axis for Life Expectancy). Ensure
  the chart is clearly labeled and includes a legend to differentiate between the
  two metrics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred style or color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to be labeled in a specific format (e.g., "2008", "2009",
  "2010")?

  3. Do you prefer the y-axis labels for GNI and Life Expectancy to be on the left
  or the right side of the chart?

  4. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, should
  they be for both y-axes or just one?

  5. How detailed should the legend be for differentiating between the two metrics
  and the countries?

  6. Do you want to display data values on the columns/stacks themselves?

  7. Should the GNI and Life Expectancy be displayed in specific units or a particular
  format (e.g., commas for thousands, millions, etc.)?

  8. Would you prefer any specific fonts or text sizes for labels and legend?'

  3. GNI on the left and Life Expectancy on the right.

  4. Yes, gridlines for both y-axes would be great.

  5. Detailed enough to differentiate clearly between the two metrics and countries.

  6. I am not sure.
