initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize "Life expectancy at birth, total
  (years)" across all countries from 2008 to 2010. Use separate lines for Korea (Rep.),
  Kuwait, Kenya, Korea (Dem. People's Rep.), Kiribati, and Kazakhstan. Highlight Korea
  (Rep.) in blue to differentiate it. Annotate key data points in 2010 for clarity.
  This visualization will help compare life expectancy trends and improve health policy
  assessments in different nations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the line chart?

  2. What should the labels for the X-axis and Y-axis be?

  3. Do you have specific colors in mind for the lines representing Kuwait, Kenya,
  Korea (Dem. People''s Rep.), Kiribati, and Kazakhstan?

  4. Would you like markers on the data points for better visibility?

  5. Do you prefer any specific line styles (solid, dashed, dotted) for the different
  countries?

  6. Should the Y-axis have a specific range or should it auto-scale based on the
  data?

  7. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where would you prefer it
  to be positioned (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  9. Do you have a preference for grid lines on the chart background?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart?'
