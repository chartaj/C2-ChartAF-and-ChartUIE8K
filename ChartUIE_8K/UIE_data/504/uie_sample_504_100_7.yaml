initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot comparing the Life Expectancy at Birth
  against Fertility Rates for the years available in the dataset. Use different colors
  for each country to differentiate them. Please place Life Expectancy at Birth on
  the Y-axis and Fertility Rates on the X-axis. Include data points from Korea, Rep.,
  Kuwait, Kenya, Korea, Dem. Peopleâ€™s Rep., Kiribati, and Kazakhstan to reflect diverse
  life and fertility dynamics. The goal is to visualize how fertility rates are correlated
  with life expectancy across different nations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  for different countries?

  2. Would you like to use data points for all available years or focus on specific
  years?

  3. Do you prefer a specific point shape or size for the scatter plot markers?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Would you like axis labels and titles? If so, do you have specific text in mind?

  6. Do you want to add a legend to differentiate the countries, and if so, any preference
  on its placement?

  7. Would you like to include a trend line or regression line on the scatter plot
  to highlight the correlation?

  8. Do you want to use any specific tooltips or annotations for the data points when
  hovered over?

  9. Should the chart have any specific background color or remain default white?'
