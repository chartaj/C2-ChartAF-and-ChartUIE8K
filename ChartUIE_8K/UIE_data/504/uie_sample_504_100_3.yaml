initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map to visualize the data on GNI (PPP)
  for the different countries from the dataset. Use the 'Time' column to make the
  year selector, so I can see the data for different years (2008, 2009, 2010). Highlight
  Korea, Rep., Kuwait, Kenya, Kazakhstan, and Kiribati with gradients based on their
  GNI values. Add hover information to show the exact GNI, life expectancy, and fertility
  rate data for the hovered country and year. This way, I can easily compare these
  countries' economic and health metrics over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the gradients on the choropleth
  map?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the color used to highlight the specific countries
  (Korea, Rep., Kuwait, Kenya, Kazakhstan, and Kiribati)?

  3. Should the choropleth map display political boundaries and country names, or
  should it focus solely on the gradient and color encoding?

  4. Is there a specific layout or style you prefer for the year selector?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the gradient colors and their corresponding
  GNI values?

  6. Do you have preferences for the hover information''s format or arrangement (e.g.,
  order of GNI, life expectancy, and fertility rate)?

  7. Are there any specific font styles, sizes, or colors you prefer for the labels
  and text on the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. The map should display political boundaries and country names.

  4. I do not have any specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the gradient colors and their corresponding
  GNI values.

  6. I would prefer the order to be GNI, then life expectancy, and then fertility
  rate.

  7. I do not know.'
