initial_prompt: Create a violin plot comparing the GNI, PPP (current international
  $) and the Life expectancy at birth, total (years) for Korea, Rep., Kuwait, Kenya,
  Kiribati, and Kazakhstan. Focus on the years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Highlight Korea,
  Rep. as a specific interest in the plot. Display annotations for Korea, Rep.â€™s life
  expectancy and GNI explicitly for these years, to emphasize country-specific insights.
  This visualization aims to explore the distribution and relationships between economic
  performance and life expectancy, highlighting significant differences among the
  selected countries. Ensure it is clear and informative for presentation purposes.
