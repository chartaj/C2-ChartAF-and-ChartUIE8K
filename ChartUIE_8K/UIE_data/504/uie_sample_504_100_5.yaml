initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the GNI (Gross National Income)
  in PPP (current international $) and life expectancy at birth across different countries
  (Korea, Rep., Kuwait, Kenya, Kore, Dem. People's Rep., Kiribati, Kazakhstan) over
  time (2008-2010). Each bubble should represent a country-year data point. The x-axis
  should show GNI values, the y-axis should show life expectancy, and the size of
  the bubbles should correspond to the fertility rate. Use different colors for each
  country to differentiate them clearly. Show data trends in changes over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the countries?

  2. Would you like to include data labels for each bubble to show exact values?

  3. Should grid lines be included on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for titles and labels?

  5. Do you want to add a legend to the chart to explain the color and size encoding?

  6. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like on the chart?

  7. Do you have any preference on the scale of the axes (linear or logarithmic)?

  8. Should we include markers or lines to indicate yearly changes for each country?

  9. Do you prefer specific axis labels or descriptions?

  10. Would you like to emphasize certain data points or trends in the chart?'
