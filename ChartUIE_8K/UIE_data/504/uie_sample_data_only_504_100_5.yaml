  Create a bubble chart to visualize the GNI (Gross National Income) in PPP (current
  international $) and life expectancy at birth across different countries (Korea,
  Rep., Kuwait, Kenya, Kore, Dem. People''s Rep., Kiribati, Kazakhstan) over time
  (2008-2010). Each bubble should represent a country-year data point. The x-axis
  should show GNI values, the y-axis should show life expectancy, and the size of
  the bubbles should correspond to the fertility rate. Use different colors for each
  country to differentiate them clearly. Show data trends in changes over the years.

  \n<start of user request>\nCreate a bubble chart to visualize the GNI (Gross National\

  \ countries (Korea, Rep., Kuwait, Kenya, Kore, Dem. People's Rep., Kiribati, Kazakhstan)\
  \ over time (2008-2010). Each bubble should represent a country-year data point.\
  \ The x-axis should show GNI values, the y-axis should show life expectancy, and\
  \ the size of the bubbles should correspond to the fertility rate. Use different\
  \ colors for each country to differentiate them clearly. Show data trends in changes\
