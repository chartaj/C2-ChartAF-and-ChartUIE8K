initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Life expectancy
  at birth (total years) across different countries from 2008 to 2010. The countries
  to be included are Korea (Rep.), Kuwait, Kenya, Korea (Dem. People's Rep.), Kiribati,
  and Kazakhstan. The x-axis should represent the countries, and the y-axis should
  represent life expectancy at birth in years. Ensure that missing data ('..') is
  handled appropriately. Label the chart clearly with country names and provide a
  legend if necessary. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like the median line in each box to be highlighted? If so, in which
  color?

  4. Should outliers, if any, be marked distinctly in the box chart? If yes, please
  specify how.

  5. Do you prefer any specific format for the box borders and whiskers (e.g., solid,
  dashed)?

  6. Should each country''s box be filled with a specific pattern or remain solid-colored?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart? If yes, for both axes or just one? Any
  preference for their appearance?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement or style?'
