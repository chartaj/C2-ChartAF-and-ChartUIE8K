initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the GNI (PPP) vs. Life expectancy
  at birth for Korea, Rep., Kuwait, and Kenya over the years 2008-2010. Use bubble
  size to represent Fertility rate.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubbles representing each
  country?

  2. Should the bubbles have borders, and if so, what color would you prefer for the
  borders?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the size range of the bubbles?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, what color and style should
  they be?

  5. What labeling style do you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis (e.g., font type,
  size, and color)?

  6. Should there be a legend explaining the bubble sizes and colors, and if so, where
  would you like it positioned?

  7. Do you want data point labels directly on the bubbles, and if so, what information
  should they display and in what format?

  8. Would you prefer a specific orientation (horizontal or vertical) for the chart?

  9. Should there be any specific annotations or highlights for particular data points
  or trends?

  10. Do you require any specific titles or subtitles for the chart, and if so, what
  text and font style would you prefer?'

  10. Yes, a title would be good. "GNI (PPP) vs. Life Expectancy at Birth (2008-2010)"
  would be fine, but I have no specific preference for the font style.'
