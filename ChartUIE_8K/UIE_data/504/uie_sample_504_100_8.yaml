initial_prompt: Create a radial bar chart visualizing the GNI, PPP for Korea, Rep.,
  Kuwait, Kenya, and Kazakhstan from 2008 to 2010. Each country's GNI, PPP should
  have separate radial bars for each year, showing the values from the dataset. Different
  radial segments should represent different years (2008, 2009, 2010). Make sure each
  country is clearly labeled and distinguishable using different colors or shades.
  Title the chart appropriately and include legends for clarity. This will help compare
  the economic growth among these countries over the specified period in a visually
  intuitive manner.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different countries?

  2. How would you like the years (2008, 2009, 2010) to be differentiated in the radial
  segments (e.g., different shades, patterns)?

  3. What specific labels or annotations do you want to include on the chart?

  4. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  5. Are there any additional elements you want to be included in the legend for clarity?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme for the different countries.

  2. I am not sure, maybe different shades for the years would work.

  3. I do not know, just the country names and GNI, PPP values should be enough.

  4. Title the chart "GNI, PPP Comparison for Selected Countries (2008-2010)".

  5. I do not have any additional elements in mind for the legend.'
