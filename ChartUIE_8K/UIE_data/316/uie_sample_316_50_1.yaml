initial_prompt: Create a Pie chart showing the percentage distribution of Bumblebee
  species collected in different countries from the dataset. Highlight Thailand and
  Laos to emphasize their specimen counts. Add annotations to indicate the number
  of specimens from the top two countries. This visual aids comparative analysis of
  species distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the pie chart?

  2. How would you like Thailand and Laos to be highlighted (e.g., different colors,
  larger slices, bold outlines)?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the annotations?

  4. Should the annotations for the top two countries include both percentage and
  absolute count, or only one of them?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  on the legend (e.g., descending order of specimen count)?

  6. Would you like the chart to include a title and, if so, what should it be?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labels or descriptions to be added to the pie chart
  for better clarity?

  8. Should the pie chart have a 3D effect, or would you prefer a flat design?'
