initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of bumblebee specimen
  collection years from the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset. This will
  help visualize the number of specimens collected in different years. Ensure that
  the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis represents the frequency of collections.
  Use the 'Year' column to create this histogram. Exclude any missing values. Since
  the dataset spans different periods, it will be interesting to observe which years
  had the highest collection rates and any possible trends or gaps in data collection.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Should the histogram display any annotations or labels directly on the bars to
  indicate frequencies?

  3. Do you prefer a specific bin width for the histogram, or should it be automatically
  calculated?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed in the background of the histogram?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  6. Should the histogram have a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  7. Do you prefer the y-axis to have a linear or logarithmic scale?

  8. Would you like to include a legend even if it''s a single series histogram, for
  clarification purposes?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?

  10. Should any notable years (e.g., highest collection rates) be highlighted or
  annotated in the histogram?'
