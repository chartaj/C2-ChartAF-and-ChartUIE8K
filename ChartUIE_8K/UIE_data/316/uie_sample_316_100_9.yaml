initial_prompt: Please create a box chart that visualizes the distribution of latitude
  and longitude values for bumblebee specimen collections across different countries.
  The chart should have latitude on one axis and longitude on the other, with each
  country represented by a different box. This will help us understand the geographic
  spread of bumblebee populations in Southeast Asia. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme used to represent
  different countries?

  2. Would you like any specific statistical details to be included inside the box
  chart, such as median lines or quartile ranges?

  3. How would you prefer the chart to handle outliers? Should they be highlighted
  or ignored?

  4. Is there any specific labeling style you would like for the axes (e.g., degree
  symbols for latitude and longitude, country names)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the boxes (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to denote the different countries?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart to enhance readability?

  8. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the country names and
  other annotations on the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, like a title
  or subtitle, for the chart?

  10. Is there a specific way you would prefer the data points to be depicted within
  each box (e.g., dots, crosses)?'
