initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset.
  Plot the 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Species' on the y-axis to visualize the number
  of different species collected over the years. Ensure missing values are handled
  appropriately, and include legends for different species, if needed. Also, show
  data points for each year to observe the trend. Highlight months and locations on
  hover. This will help in understanding the distribution and variety of species collected
  over time and their geographic data. Please make the chart interactive for better
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the line style to be solid, dashed, or dotted?

  3. Should data points be represented by specific markers (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and legends?

  5. How would you like missing values to be handled (e.g., interpolate, leave gaps)?

  6. Do you want the chart to include grid lines? If yes, should they be horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  7. Is there a specific way you would prefer the data for different species to be
  distinguished (e.g., different colors, different line styles)?

  8. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  9. Are there specific years or data ranges you want to highlight on the chart?

  10. Do you require annotations for specific data points? If so, which ones?

  11. Would you like to set a specific range for the x-axis and y-axis, or should
  it be auto-scaled?

  12. Do you prefer to display the month and location details in a tooltip or as part
  of the hover functionality?'
