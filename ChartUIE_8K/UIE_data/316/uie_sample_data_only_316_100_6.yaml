02_initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of Bumblebee specimens
  collected per country from the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset. The x-axis
  should represent the countries, and the y-axis should show the count of specimens
  collected. Ensure each bar is differentiated by color to represent unique country
  collections. Include clear labels for the x-axis (Country) and y-axis (Number of
  Specimens). The chart should help identify which countries have the highest and
  lowest Bumblebee specimen collections in the dataset. Add a title "Bumblebee Specimens
