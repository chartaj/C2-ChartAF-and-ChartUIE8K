initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map to visualize the distribution of Southeast
  Asian bumblebee specimens from the dataset. Highlight countries like Thailand and
  Laos based on the quantity of specimens collected. Use colors to indicate the number
  of specimens per country. Annotate important data points such as specific locations
  (e.g., Doi Suthep-Pui NP, Luang Prabang) with collection details like year and collector
  names. The goal is to emphasize areas with high specimen collection and provide
  context for bumblebee biodiversity in these regions. This map will aid in understanding
  species distribution patterns across Southeast Asia.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for indicating the number
  of specimens per country?

  2. How would you like the important data points (e.g., specific locations, collection
  details) to be annotated? Should they be displayed as tooltips, labels, or another
  format?

  3. Are there any specific thresholds for the number of specimens that should trigger
  different color intensity levels on the map?

  4. Do you prefer a particular map projection for the Choropleth map?

  5. Should the map include additional geographic features (e.g., rivers, mountains)
  for context?

  6. Is there a specific label or title you would like for the map?

  7. Should the legend use continuous or discrete color bars to represent the number
  of specimens?

  8. How would you like to handle overlapping annotations for locations with many
  specimen collections?

  9. Would you prefer the annotations to include all the collection details, or just
  the most relevant ones (e.g., year and collector names)?

  10. Are there any other specific data points or metrics that you would like to see
  highlighted on the map?'
