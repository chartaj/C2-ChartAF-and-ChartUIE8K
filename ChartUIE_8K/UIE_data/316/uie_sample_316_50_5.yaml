initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot displaying the relationship between Latitude
  and Longitude of bumblebee collection sites. Highlight data points by Species and
  use different marker colors for each Species.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the species?

  2. Would you like specific marker shapes for each species, or is color differentiation
  sufficient?

  3. Should the scatter plot have grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a specific labeling or annotation style for the axes (e.g., Latitude
  and Longitude ranges)?

  5. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include in the scatter
  plot (e.g., chart title, axis titles)?

  6. Do you require a legend to differentiate the species, and if so, where would
  you like it to be positioned?

  7. Should the plot include reference lines or markers at specific Latitude and Longitude
  values?

  8. Do you have a preferred background style (e.g., white, grid, map overlay)?
