initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize the Southeast Asian Bumblebee
  Specimen Dataset. Specifically, compare the number of specimens collected each year,
  segmented by their caste (Male, Worker, etc.). The X-axis should represent the Year,
  and the Y-axis should show the Count of specimens. Each year should be further divided
  into different colors for the castes. This will help us understand the distribution
  of different bumblebee castes over the years. Please use the 'Year' and 'Caste'
  columns for this chart. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different castes in the
  stacked column chart?

  2. What range of years would you like to display on the X-axis?

  3. Are there specific years that should be highlighted or annotated?

  4. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal stacked column chart?

  5. Should the Y-axis have a specific scale or range, or should it auto-scale based
  on the data?

  6. Would you like data labels to be displayed on each segment of the columns?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  8. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability of the data?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to indicate the colors representing each caste?

  10. Are there any specific chart titles, subtitles, or annotations you would like
  to be included?'
