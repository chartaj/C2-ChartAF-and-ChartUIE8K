initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the geographic distribution of
  bumblebee species collected in Southeast Asia. Annotate key locations such as Doi
  Suthep-Pui NP and Luang Prabang, highlighting species variety, elevation, and collector
  details to provide context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Choropleth map to represent
  different species?

  2. What level of detail would you like for the annotations of key locations?

  3. Should the map focus on a specific timeframe for the collection data, or should
  it include all available data?

  4. How would you like the elevation differences to be displayed, if at all?

  5. Do you prefer certain map projections (e.g., Mercator, Albers) for this visualization?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to be included or highlighted
  in the map?

  7. Would you like the collectors'' names to appear next to each entry, or grouped
  in a separate legend?

  8. Should the map include additional geographic features (e.g., rivers, borders)
  for better contextual understanding?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.
