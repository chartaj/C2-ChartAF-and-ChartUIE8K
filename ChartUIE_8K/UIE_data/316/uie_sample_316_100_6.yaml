initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of Bumblebee specimens collected
  per country from the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset. The x-axis should
  represent the countries, and the y-axis should show the count of specimens collected.
  Ensure each bar is differentiated by color to represent unique country collections.
  Include clear labels for the x-axis (Country) and y-axis (Number of Specimens).
  The chart should help identify which countries have the highest and lowest Bumblebee
  specimen collections in the dataset. Add a title "Bumblebee Specimens Collected
  per Country" for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart? If yes, in which orientation
  (horizontal, vertical, both)?

  4. How would you like to handle countries with no collected specimens: exclude them
  or show them with a bar of height zero?

  5. Do you have a preferred arrangement for the bars on the x-axis (alphabetical
  order or sorted by count)?

  6. Would you like to add any specific annotations or markers to highlight the highest
  and lowest values?

  7. Do you have a preferred chart size or aspect ratio for the visualization?

  8. Is there a particular styling you prefer for the bars (e.g., solid, striped,
  gradient)?
