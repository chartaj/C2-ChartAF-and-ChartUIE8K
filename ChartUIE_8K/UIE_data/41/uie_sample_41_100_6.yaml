initial_prompt: Please create a table chart showing the summarized statistics of the
  Mice Protein Expression dataset. Columns should include protein names like DYRK1A_N,
  ITSN1_N, BDNF_N, etc., and statistical measures such as mean, median, standard deviation,
  and the number of missing values for each protein. Additionally, include the count
  of unique values for each protein and the data types. Lastly, display a sample of
  three rows of data for better context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the table, such as vertical or horizontal
  orientation for the attributes?

  2. Would you like each statistical measure (mean, median, standard deviation, missing
  values, unique values, data types) to have its own column, or should they be grouped
  within each protein name?

  3. Do you prefer a specific ordering of the statistical measures (e.g., mean first,
  then median)?

  4. Should the sample data rows be displayed at the top or bottom of the table?

  5. How would you like to handle the formatting of the numerical values (e.g., number
  of decimal places)?

  6. Are there any specific colors or font styles you prefer for highlighting certain
  parts of the table?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes within the table
  to clarify the data?

  8. Do you prefer the background to be plain or shaded for better readability?

  9. Would you like borders to be included around each cell in the table?

  10. How should missing values be represented in the table (e.g., ''NA'', ''null'',
  blank)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Iâ€™d like the statistical measures to be grouped within each protein name.

  3. I do not know.

  4. The sample data rows should be displayed at the top of the table.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I prefer a shaded background for better readability.

  9. Yes, I would like borders around each cell in the table.

  10. Missing values should be represented as ''NA''.'
