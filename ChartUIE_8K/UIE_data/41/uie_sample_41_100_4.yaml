initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing the expression levels of various
  proteins for different MouseIDs. Use 'MouseID' on the x-axis and the relative protein
  expression levels of 'DYRK1A_N', 'ITSN1_N', and 'BDNF_N' on the y-axis. Group bars
  for each protein type by 'MouseID'. Title the chart "Protein Expression Levels by
  MouseID". Use different colors to represent each protein, and include a legend for
  clarity. This will help compare protein expression across different MouseIDs in
  the dataset. Ensure you handle missing values appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing each protein
  in the grouped bar chart?

  2. How would you like to handle missing values in the dataset (e.g., omit, replace
  with a specific value)?

  3. What specific font size and type would you prefer for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the order in which the proteins (''DYRK1A_N'',
  ''ITSN1_N'', ''BDNF_N'') are displayed?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the chart to
  highlight important data points or findings?

  6. Do you want to specify any axis limits for the y-axis (protein expression levels)?

  7. Do you prefer bars to be of a specific width or spacing within the grouped bar
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure, maybe you can decide the best way to handle missing values.

  3. I have no specific preference for font size and type.

  4. I do not know, you can display them in any order.

  5. I have no specific preference regarding annotations or markers.

  6. I do not have any preference for y-axis limits.

  7. I do not have any preference for bar width or spacing.'
