initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart to visualize the protein expression levels
  in mice from the provided CSV data. Specifically, I want to see the comparison of
  expression levels for a subset of proteins (DYRK1A_N, ITSN1_N, BDNF_N, NR1_N, NR2A_N)
  across different MouseIDs. Highlight the differences between the Control and Treated
  groups. Ensure each axis represents one protein, and the values are normalized for
  easier comparison. The chart should also differentiate between the Genotype and
  Treatment categories for clear analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the differences
  between Control and Treated groups?

  2. Is there a specific way you would like the Genotype and Treatment categories
  to be visually differentiated? (e.g., different line styles, markers)

  3. Do you prefer any specific normalization method for the protein expression levels?

  4. Would you like to include legends or labels for clarity? If so, where should
  they be positioned?

  5. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the radar chart?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or data point labels you want to include on
  the chart?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the proteins to appear on the
  axes?

  8. Would you like to set specific axis limits for consistency across all axes?

  9. Are there any specific design elements or styles you would like to avoid?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the normalization method.

  4. Yes, please include legends or labels for clarity, but I am not sure about their
  position.

  5. No specific title or subtitle preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific order for the proteins.

  8. I am not sure about setting specific axis limits.

  9. No specific design elements or styles to avoid.'
