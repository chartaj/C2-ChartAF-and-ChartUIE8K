initial_prompt: I want to create a Sunburst chart visualizing the Mice Protein Expression
  data. The chart should represent hierarchical data with 'Genotype' at the top level,
  branching into 'Treatment', then 'Behavior', and the innermost level showing different
  class categories. Highlight the segments based on the 'class' column. Include text
  annotations for key protein expression values like 'DYRK1A_N', 'BDNF_N', and 'NR1_N'.
  The purpose is to understand the distribution and hierarchical relationship of protein
  expressions among different genotype, treatment, and behavior groups in mice.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used to highlight
  the segments based on the ''class'' column?

  2. Would you like the text annotations for key protein expression values to be inside
  the segments or outside with connecting lines?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  4. Should we include a legend or any additional labels to clarify the hierarchy
  levels?

  5. Do you prefer a specific format or style for displaying the protein expression
  values within the annotations (e.g., decimal places, units)?

  6. Would you like to display additional information as tooltips when hovering over
  the segments?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I am not sure about the color palette, use something that is visually distinct.

  2. I would like the text annotations for key protein expression values to be inside
  the segments.

  3. I have no specific font preferences.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to clarify the hierarchy levels.

  5. Display the protein expression values with one decimal place.

  6. I am not sure about displaying additional information as tooltips.
