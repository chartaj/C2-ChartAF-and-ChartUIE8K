initial_prompt: I have a dataset on mouse protein expression levels categorized by
  genotype, treatment, behavior, and class. I need a stacked bar chart that shows
  the expression levels of different proteins (like DYRK1A_N, BDNF_N, NR1_N, etc.)
  for each genotype ('Control' and 'Ts65Dn'), segmented by treatment ('Memantine'
  vs. 'Saline') and behavior ('C/S', 'S/C', etc.). Each bar should represent a unique
  protein, and segments should represent different experimental conditions. This will
  help analyze how protein expressions vary under different conditions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a color scheme preference for the different segments of
  the bar chart?

  2. Would you like to include error bars or variability indicators within the stacked
  bars?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order in which the segments are stacked?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for the y-axis (protein expression levels)?

  5. Would you like axis labels and legends to include specific information or descriptions?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the x-axis labels (e.g., angled, vertical,
  summarized)?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Do you want to include any annotations or reference markers on the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred background style or gridline presentation for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Control'', then ''Ts65Dn'' would be preferred

  4. I would like the y-axis to have a detailed granularity to show distinct differences
  in protein expression levels.

  5. Yes, please include axis labels and legends with specific information about the
  genotypes, treatments, and behaviors.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.'
