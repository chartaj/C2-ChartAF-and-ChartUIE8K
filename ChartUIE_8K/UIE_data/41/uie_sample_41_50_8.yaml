initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of the "GluR4_N" protein
  expression levels from the "Mice Protein Expression" data. Highlight any significant
  peaks or outliers to help understand the variation across the observed MouseIDs.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like to set specific bin widths or the number of bins?

  4. Should the x-axis be labeled as ''GluR4_N Expression Level'' and the y-axis as
  ''Frequency''?

  5. Would you prefer to include a legend or annotations for significant peaks and
  outliers?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis scales (linear, logarithmic,
  etc.)?

  7. Would you like to display gridlines in the background?

  8. Do you have a specific format for showing data labels or values on the histogram
  bars?

  9. Are there any particular reference lines or markers (such as mean or median)
  you want to include in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include a subtitle or any additional information about the
  dataset in the chart?'
