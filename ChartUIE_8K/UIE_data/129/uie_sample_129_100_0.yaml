initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the Total Cases, Active, Discharged, and
  Deaths by State/UTs in India using the latest Covid-19 statewise data. Use text
  annotations to highlight the discharge ratio and death ratio on the bars. Emphasize
  states with high total cases for better visibility. The chart should help quickly
  compare the Covid-19 situation across different states and identify regions that
  had more severe impacts. Highlight states with zero active cases to show recovery
  success. This visualization will aid in understanding the distribution and status
  of Covid-19 cases in India effectively.
