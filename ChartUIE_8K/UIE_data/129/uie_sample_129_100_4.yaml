initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the Latest Covid-19 India
  Statewise Data. The chart should display each state/UT along the x-axis and the
  total number of cases, active cases, discharged cases, and deaths along the y-axis.
  Each category (total cases, active, discharged, deaths) should have its own color-coded
  column for easy comparison. Make sure to include a legend and label the axes appropriately.
  This visualization will help to quickly understand the Covid-19 impact and recovery
  status across different states and UTs in India.

  active cases, discharged cases, deaths)?
