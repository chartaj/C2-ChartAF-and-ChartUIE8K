initial_prompt: Using the provided Covid-19 statewise data, create a Treemap chart
  to visualize the Total Cases for each State/UT. For each state, assign a different
  color to represent varying numbers of total cases. Enhance each block with additional
  information for Active, Discharged, Deaths, and Population. Ensure that the size
  of the blocks correlates with the Total Cases to give a clear comparative overview
  across different states/UTs. This visualization will help understand the Covid-19
  impact distribution across India. Refer to all given datasets to ensure comprehensive
  visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for representing
  varying numbers of total cases?

  2. Should we include legends or a color gradient to depict the different ranges
  of total cases?

  3. Do you want to prioritize certain states/UTs in terms of visibility on the chart?

  4. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the labels (State/UTs,
  Total Cases, etc.)?

  5. Would you like to include tooltips or labels to show detailed information (Active,
  Discharged, Deaths, Population) for each block?

  6. Are there any specific size constraints or dimensions for the Treemap chart that
  we should consider?

  7. Should there be any additional annotations or highlights for key insights such
  as states with the highest or lowest number of total cases?

  8. Do you want the blocks to be arranged in a specific order, such as descending
  order of total cases?'
