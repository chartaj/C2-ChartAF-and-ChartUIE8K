initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the latest Covid-19 data across various
  states/UTs in India. Use annotations to highlight the states with the highest and
  lowest discharge ratios. The chart should compare the Total Cases, Active Cases,
  Discharged Cases, and Deaths among the states, with different color boxes for each
  category. Highlight anomalies or outliers among these categories to emphasize key
  data points. The purpose of this visualization is to quickly understand the distribution
  and impact of Covid-19 across different regions, focusing on recovery and mortality
  rates relevant to the population size.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between\
  \ Total Cases, Active Cases, Discharged Cases, and Deaths?\n2. Do you prefer the\
  \ chart to have a vertical or horizontal layout for easier comparison between states/UTs?\n\
  3. Would you like the chart to have grid lines for better readability?\n4. Do you\
  \ have any specific font preferences for annotations and labels?\n5. Should the\
  \ chart include a legend to explain the color coding for each category?\n6. Do you\
  \ want to set specific thresholds to highlight outliers or anomalies?\n7. Do you\
  \ prefer any specific format or style for emphasizing the annotations (e.g., bold\
  \ text, different color for annotations)?\n8. Should the population size be displayed\
  \ directly on the chart or as tooltips when hovering over the data points? \n9.\
  \ Do you have any preferences for the ordering of states/UTs, such as ascending\
  \ or descending based on Total Cases or another attribute?"
