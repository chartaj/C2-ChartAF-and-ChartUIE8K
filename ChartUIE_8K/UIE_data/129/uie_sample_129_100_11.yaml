initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the Latest Covid-19 India
  Statewise Data. Display the total number of cases, active cases, discharged cases,
  and deaths for each State/UT. Ensure each State/UT is represented on the x-axis
  and the different case categories are grouped together for comparison. Use distinct
  colors for total cases, active cases, discharged cases, and deaths to easily differentiate
  between them. Include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to each category.
  Adjust the y-axis to reflect the number of cases accurately. Ensure the chart is
  clear and easy to read.

  cases, active cases, discharged cases, deaths)?
