2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart showing the Total Cases, Active, Discharged, and Deaths by State/UTs
  in India using the latest Covid-19 statewise data. Use text annotations to highlight
  the discharge ratio and death ratio on the bars. Emphasize states with high total
  cases for better visibility. The chart should help quickly compare the Covid-19
  situation across different states and identify regions that had more severe impacts.
  Highlight states with zero active cases to show recovery success. This visualization
  will aid in understanding the distribution and status of Covid-19 cases in India
  effectively.
