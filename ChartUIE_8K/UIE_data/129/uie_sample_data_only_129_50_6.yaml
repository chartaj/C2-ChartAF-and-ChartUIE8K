  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

  chart, such as state/UT population or ratios?

  6. Is there a maximum number of color variations you want to use in the treemap
  to avoid clutter?

  7. Do you have any preference for the overall layout of the treemap, such as squarified
  or slice-and-dice?

  8. Would you like to see the exact values of each statistic displayed on the treemap,
  or will a mouse-over tooltip be sufficient?

  9. Are there any state/UTs you would like to exclude or prioritize in the visualization?
