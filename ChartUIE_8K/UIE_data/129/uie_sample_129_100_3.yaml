initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the Covid-19 trends for
  Indian states and union territories over time. The x-axis should represent the states/UTs,
  and the y-axis should show the number of cases. Include separate lines for Total
  Cases, Active Cases, Discharged Cases, and Deaths. Ensure each line is labeled and
  has a distinct color for clarity. The chart should also include a legend and gridlines
  for better readability. The goal is to compare how each state/UT has progressed
  in terms of total cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing\
  \ Total Cases, Active Cases, Discharged Cases, and Deaths?\n2. What style or theme\
  \ would you prefer for the chart (e.g., minimalistic, colorful, professional)?\n\
  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the labels\
  \ and legend?\n4. Would you like to include any specific titles for the chart and\
  \ the axes?\n5. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines (e.g., color, thickness)?\
  \ \n6. Should the chart include data markers at each data point along the lines?\n\
  7. Would you like to display the exact values of data points as labels on the chart?"
