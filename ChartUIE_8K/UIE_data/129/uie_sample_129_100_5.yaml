initial_prompt: I want to visualize a heatmap using the "Latest Covid-19 India Statewise
  Data." Specifically, I want the heatmap to display the "Total Cases," "Discharged,"
  "Deaths," and "Population" for each "State/UTs." Each state's metrics should be
  clearly differentiated by color intensity levels to represent the values effectively.
  Ensure the heatmap highlights the variations and trends across different states
  and UTs. Additionally, add labels for each state and include a colorbar legend for
  better interpretation. This will help in quickly identifying which states had higher
  cases, discharges, deaths, and population sizes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a specific color gradient for higher vs. lower values?

  3. Are there any particular states or Union Territories you would like to emphasize
  or highlight?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines in the heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer the labels for each state to be displayed inside the heatmap cells
  or positioned outside?

  6. Do you have any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legends?

  7. How detailed should the colorbar legend be? (e.g., number of divisions or specific
  intervals)

  8. Is there a specific ordering you prefer for the states or Union Territories (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by total cases)?

  9. Do you want a title or subtitle included in the heatmap? If yes, please specify
  the text.

  10. Should there be any tooltips or additional information displayed when hovering
  over a particular state''s data on the heatmap?'
