initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the weaknesses against various types
  for different Pokemon. Highlight sections where the Pokemon has increased or decreased
  resistance (values above 1 or below 0.5). Add text annotations to emphasize notable
  resistances or vulnerabilities for specific types like "against_dragon" or "against_fairy."
  Ensure the heatmap clearly differentiates the "Seed Pokémon" by its name (Bulbasaur,
  Ivysaur, Venusaur) and uses color contrasts to emphasize weaknesses. Include Japanese
  names for context. This should help in identifying patterns in type weaknesses and
  assist in strategic gameplay planning.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should there be a specific color used to highlight increased resistance and another
  for decreased resistance?

  3. How would you like the seed Pokémon (Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, Venusaur) to be differentiated
  in the heatmap—by color, border, or any other means?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text annotations?

  5. Should the text annotations for notable resistances or vulnerabilities be placed
  inside the cells, or would you prefer them outside with arrows pointing to the cells?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the resistance values and corresponding
  colors?

  7. Do you have any preference for the layout of the heatmap (e.g., vertical orientation
  of Pokémon names vs. horizontal orientation of types)?

  8. Should the heatmap include grid lines to clearly separate each cell?

  9. Are there any specific Pokémon or types (other than "against_dragon" and "against_fairy")
  that you would like to emphasize in the heatmap?

  10. Would you like to add any additional visual elements, such as tooltips on hover
  to show exact resistance values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use specific colors for increased resistance and decreased resistance.

  3. By color.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Inside the cells would be fine.

  6. Yes, include a legend.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, include grid lines.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No, I am looking for an image, not interactive elements.'
