initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the base stats progression (HP, Attack,
  Defense, Sp. Attack, Sp. Defense, Speed) over the evolutions of a Pokémon. Use the
  sample data for Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, and Venusaur from the provided dataset. Each
  evolutionary stage should be labeled on the x-axis, and the base stats should be
  plotted on the y-axis. The dataset provided is from "The Complete Pokemon Dataset"
  under arts-and-entertainment. Please ensure the chart showcases trends in base stats
  changes as the Pokémon evolves from Bulbasaur to Ivysaur to Venusaur.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like each base stat to have a different line style (e.g., solid, dashed)
  or color?

  3. Should the y-axis be scaled proportionally to show minor changes in stats effectively?

  4. Do you want data points to be highlighted or marked with symbols?

  5. Would you prefer to include a legend to explain which line corresponds to which
  base stat?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  8. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Should the chart title and axis labels follow a specific naming convention?'
