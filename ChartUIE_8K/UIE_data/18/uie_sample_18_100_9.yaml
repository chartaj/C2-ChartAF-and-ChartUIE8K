initial_prompt: Create an area chart for the Complete Pokemon Dataset showing the
  base stats (hp, attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, speed) across different
  Pokemon generations. Each generation should be separately plotted. The x-axis will
  represent the generations (1 through 7), and the y-axis will show the average base
  stats values per generation. This visual will help in understanding how the base
  stats of Pokemon have evolved over each generation. Use different colors for each
  stat to make the chart clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different base stats (hp,
  attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense, speed)?

  2. Would you like to add gridlines to the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., modern, classic,
  minimalist)?

  4. Should the chart include data point markers for each generation?

  5. Would you like to display the exact average values of the base stats for each
  generation on the chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font type and size for axis labels and legend?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title and, if so, what should the title
  be?

  8. Should there be any annotations or additional information provided in the chart
  to explain key trends or changes?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis ranges or should they be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  10. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?'
