initial_prompt: I have a dataset on Pokémon attributes and would like to create a
  density plot. Please visualize the distribution of 'base_total' and 'attack' across
  all Pokémon. I want to see how these attributes are distributed independently and
  if there's any noticeable pattern or concentration. Make sure to use different colors
  for each attribute on the same plot and include a legend. This will help in identifying
  the range and frequency of these values among the Pokémon species. Your help in
  generating this plot is much appreciated. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  distinguish the ''base_total'' and ''attack'' attributes?

  2. Do you have any preference for the style or format of the legend?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines on the density plot?

  4. Do you want any specific title or labels for the axes in the plot?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text in the plot?

  6. Do you have any preference on the smoothing technique used for the density plot
  (e.g., kernel density estimation)?

  7. Would you like the density plot to have markers or annotations to highlight certain
  data points or ranges?

  8. Should there be any specific range limits for the axes in the plot?

  9. Is there any background or specific theme you prefer for the plot (e.g., light,
  dark, classic)?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the aspect ratio or dimensions of
  the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t have any specific preference.

  3. I don''t know.

  4. Just standard titles like "Base Total" and "Attack" for the axes would be fine.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No, I do not need markers or annotations.

  8. No, there are no specific range limits required.

  9. No specific theme, anything standard is fine.

  10. I do not have any specific requirements for the dimensions.'
