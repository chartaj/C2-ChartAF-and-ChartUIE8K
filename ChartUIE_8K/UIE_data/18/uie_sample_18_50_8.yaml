initial_prompt: Create a density plot to visualize the distribution of base_total,
  attack, and defense statistics for Pokemon, differentiating between generations
  and legendary status to compare their distributions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to differentiate between
  generations and legendary status?

  2. Would you prefer the density plot to have separate subplots for each generation,
  or should they be overlaid in a single plot?

  3. Should the plot include a legend to clearly indicate which lines correspond to
  each generation and legendary status?

  4. Do you want any specific axis labels or titles for the plot?

  5. Should the plot highlight any specific statistical measures such as mean or median
  for the distributions?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) to
  differentiate between generations and legendary status?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the plot for better readability?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the background of the plot (e.g., white, grey,
  patterned)?

  9. Are there any specific fonts you would like to be used for the titles and labels
  in the plot?'
