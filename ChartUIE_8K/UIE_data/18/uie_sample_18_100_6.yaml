initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart using data from the Complete
  Pokemon Dataset. The chart should display Pokémon types (type1 and type2) along
  the x-axis, while the y-axis should represent the average base_total for each type.
  Stack the values by generation to show how the average base_total changes across
  different generations for each type. Use different colors to distinguish between
  generations. This chart will help visualize the progression and distribution of
  Pokémon strengths across various types and generations. Ensure proper labels and
  a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette used for different
  generations?

  2. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  legend?

  3. Do you want the x-axis to display icons or images of Pokémon types along with
  the type names?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, do you have a style preference for
  them?

  5. Would you like to display the exact average values of ''base_total'' on top of
  each stacked segment?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the Pokémon types to be displayed
  along the x-axis?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  8. Are there specific margin or padding requirements for the chart to fit into a
  presentation or report?

  9. Do you want the y-axis to start from zero, or should it be auto-scaled based
  on the data values?

  10. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the chart area, and is there a
  preferred position (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette for different generations.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for font styles or sizes for the chart labels
  and legend.

  3. I do not know; images of Pokémon types along with type names could be nice but
  are not essential.

  4. I am not sure if the chart should include gridlines.

  5. I don''t think displaying the exact average values on top of each stacked segment
  is necessary.

  6. I do not have a specific order preference for the Pokémon types along the x-axis.

  7. Yes, please add a title. The title should be "Average Base Total by Pokémon Type
  and Generation."

  8. I do not have specific margin or padding requirements for the chart.

  9. Yes, the y-axis should start from zero.

  10. The legend should be placed outside the chart area, preferably on the right
  side.'
