initial_prompt: I want a bubble chart that visualizes the relationship between Pokémon
  base_total and weight_kg, with bubbles sized by hp and colored by type1. Label the
  axes accordingly and make sure to highlight legendaries differently.

  Pokémon types (type1)?

  shape, border, color outline)?

  to cover?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be present on the chart?

  5. What font and size would you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  more prominently?
