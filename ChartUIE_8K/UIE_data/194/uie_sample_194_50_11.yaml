initial_prompt: Create a line chart comparing the 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', and 'z' magnitudes
  across the 'ra' values from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Should each of the magnitudes (''u'', ''g'', ''r'', ''i'', ''z'') have a distinct
  line style or color?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart? If so, would you prefer vertical,
  horizontal, or both?

  4. Do you want to display data points on the lines to highlight individual measurements?

  5. Would you like a legend included to clearly identify each magnitude (''u'', ''g'',
  ''r'', ''i'', ''z'')?

  6. Is there a specific range or scaling you prefer for the x-axis (''ra'' values)
  and y-axis (magnitude values)?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or markers on the chart to highlight key
  data points or ranges?

  8. Should the chart include labels and titles for the axes, such as ''Right Ascension
  (ra)'' for the x-axis and ''Magnitude'' for the y-axis?

  9. Would you prefer the chart background to be a specific color or remain white?

  10. Are there any additional details or contextual information you would like to
  appear on the chart?'
