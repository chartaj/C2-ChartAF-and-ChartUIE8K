initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the Redshift distribution by RA
  and Dec. Highlight regions with high redshift and annotate specific stars and galaxies
  to focus on their redshift values. Use the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 space-and-astronomy
  data.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for highlighting regions with high
  redshift?

  2. Should specific stars and galaxies be annotated with labels, or would you prefer
  tooltips?

  3. Is there a specific range of redshift values you want to focus on for highlighting?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of the annotations for specific
  stars and galaxies?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included for better reference of the RA and Dec
  coordinates?

  6. Do you prefer a specific scaling method (e.g., logarithmic, linear) for the redshift
  values?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the title, axis labels, or legends on the chart?

  8. What level of detail would you like for the axes (e.g., major/minor tick intervals,
  axis labels)?'

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, include grid lines.

  6. I do not know.
