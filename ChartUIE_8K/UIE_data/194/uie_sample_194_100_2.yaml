initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the count of different 'class'
  values (STAR, GALAXY) across various 'run' values. Annotate the chart to highlight
  specific bars where the count of 'GALAXY' significantly exceeds 'STAR.' Utilize
  color highlights to distinguish between the different classes for better visualization.
  This will help in understanding the distribution of celestial objects over different
  observational runs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14. Add text annotations to
  indicate the most and least frequent 'run' values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  the ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY'' classes?

  2. Would you like to set a specific threshold for what constitutes a ''significant''
  difference between ''GALAXY'' and ''STAR'' counts, or should this be determined
  automatically?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the annotations indicating the
  most and least frequent ''run'' values?

  5. Should the y-axis be displayed with a particular scale (e.g., logarithmic) or
  specific range?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to include a legend, and if so, should it be placed in
  a specific location on the chart?

  7. How would you like the bars to be sorted (e.g., by ''run'' values in ascending
  order, descending order, or based on the count of ''GALAXY'' values)?'
answers: "1. I am not sure about specific color preferences.\n2. I do not know, let's\
  \ determine the significant difference automatically.\n3. I do not have a specific\
  \ preference for fonts or font sizes.\n4. I do not have a preference for the positioning\
  \ of the annotations indicating the most and least frequent 'run' values.\n5. I\
  \ am not sure about the y-axis scale. \n6. Yes, please include a legend. I do not\
  \ have a preference for its location.\n7. I have no specific preference, sorting\
  \ by 'run' values in ascending order is probably fine."
