initial_prompt: Create a hexbin chart to visualize the density of celestial objects
  from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset. Use 'ra' (right ascension) for the
  x-axis and 'dec' (declination) for the y-axis. Color-code the bins by the number
  of objects in each bin to show concentration differences in the sky. Make sure to
  label the axes accurately and provide a color bar legend to illustrate the density
  values. This will help understand the distribution of celestial objects in specific
  regions of the sky comprehensively.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the bins?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the number of hexagonal bins?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Any specific format?

  4. Would you like the plot to include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preferred style or font for the axis labels and legend text?

  6. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Is there any specific range for ''ra'' and ''dec'' you would like to focus on?

  8. Do you need any annotations or markers on specific regions of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. Please label the x-axis as "Right Ascension (ra)" and the y-axis as "Declination
  (dec)".

  4. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific range; please cover the full dataset.

  8. I do not need any annotations or markers on specific regions.'
