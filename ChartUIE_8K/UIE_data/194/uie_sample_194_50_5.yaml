initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14
  data, plotting RA (right ascension) and Dec (declination) coordinates. Customize
  with color intensity based on redshift values to show distribution patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to interpret the color intensities?

  3. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Would you prefer a particular range of values for redshift to be highlighted?

  5. Are there specific zoom levels or ranges for RA and Dec that should be focused
  on?

  6. Should the map projection be customized in any particular way?

  7. Do you want to include any textual annotations or labels on notable data points?

  8. Is there a specific scale or range for the color intensity you would like to
  use?'
