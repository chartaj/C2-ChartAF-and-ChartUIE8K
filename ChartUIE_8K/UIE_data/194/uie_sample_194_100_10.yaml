initial_prompt: I would like a histogram that visualizes the distribution of redshift
  values from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 dataset. The histogram should have
  redshift values on the x-axis and the frequency of occurrences on the y-axis. Use
  the data from the 'redshift' column to create this chart, ensuring to include all
  the values represented in the dataset to give an accurate distribution. This will
  help analyze how common different redshift values are in space and astronomy for
  stars and galaxies. Thank you!
questions: '1. Should there be any specific bin size or number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the color of the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like to include labels or annotations for specific redshift ranges
  or values?

  4. Should the histogram display the x-axis and y-axis with logarithmic scaling?

  5. Is there a preferred style or theme for the chart (e.g., dark mode, classical,
  minimalistic)?

  6. Do you want any additional statistics displayed on the histogram, such as mean
  or median redshift values?

  7. Should the histogram include grid lines for better visualization of data points?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  9. Would you like to see a legend included if there are any subdivisions in the
  data (e.g., by class such as ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY'')?'
