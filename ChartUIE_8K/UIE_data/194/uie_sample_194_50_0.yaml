initial_prompt: Visualize a network diagram connecting celestial objects (stars, galaxies)
  using coordinates (ra, dec) as nodes. Highlight significant redshift values and
  object classes with different colors. Annotate unusual redshift values for clarity.
  Use data from Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing different object
  classes (e.g., stars vs. galaxies)?

  2. Do you have a specific threshold or range for what you consider significant redshift
  values?

  3. How would you like the unusual redshift values to be annotated (e.g., with labels,
  markers, or tooltips)?

  4. Do you want to include any additional details about the celestial objects in
  the annotations, such as object ID or magnitude?

  5. Is there a particular layout or style you prefer for the network diagram (e.g.,
  force-directed, hierarchical)?

  6. What is your preferred method for displaying connections between celestial objects
  (e.g., straight lines, curved lines)?

  7. Are there any specific regions of the sky (defined by ra and dec) that you want
  to focus on or highlight in the visualization?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors and annotations in the
  network diagram?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I''m not sure, maybe you can suggest a common threshold used in astronomy?

  3. I would like unusual redshift values to be annotated with labels.

  4. I am not sure, maybe just the redshift value?

  5. I don''t know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, a legend would be useful.
