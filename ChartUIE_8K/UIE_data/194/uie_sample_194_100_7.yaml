initial_prompt: Create a categorical scatter plot using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
  DR14 data. Plot the 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', and 'z' values on the y-axis against different
  'class' categories (STAR and GALAXY) on the x-axis. Differentiate the points by
  using separate colors for each class. Adjust the size of the scatter points based
  on the 'redshift' values to reflect their magnitude. This will allow us to compare
  the distribution of photometric measurements across different celestial classes
  and their correlation with redshift. Make sure the legend clearly indicates the
  color and size mappings.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating the 'class'\
  \ categories (STAR and GALAXY)?\n2. What are your preferred axis labels for the\
  \ x-axis and y-axis?\n3. Would you like gridlines on the plot for better readability?\
  \ If so, both major and minor gridlines or only major gridlines?\n4. Do you have\
  \ any specific title you want to give to the plot?\n5. Would you prefer any specific\
  \ range or limits for the y-axis to better visualize the data points?\n6. How would\
  \ you like the legend to be displayedâ€”inside the plot area or outside, and at which\
  \ position?\n7. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like for\
  \ the axis labels, title, and legend? \n8. Would you like to include data point\
  \ markers or just use colored points for the scatter plot? \n9. Do you have a preference\
  \ for the size range of the scatter points based on the 'redshift' values?\n10.\
  \ Are there any specific annotation requirements, such as highlighting certain data\
  \ points or adding any text labels?"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; maybe standard ones like blue for
  STAR and red for GALAXY?

  2. X-axis: ''Class'', Y-axis: ''Photometric Measurements (u, g, r, i, z)''

  3. I do not know.

  4. "Comparison of Photometric Measurements Across Celestial Classes"

  5. I am not sure about the specific range for the y-axis.

  6. I would prefer the legend inside the plot area, maybe at the upper right corner.

  7. I do not have any specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  8. Just colored points would be fine for the scatter plot.

  9. I do not know; I trust your judgment on this.

  10. I do not have specific annotation requirements.'
