questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing between the categories
  ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY''?

  2. Do you want the chart to include axis titles and labels? If so, any specific

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the marker shapes or sizes used in the scatter plot?

  5. Should we include a legend to differentiate between ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY''?

  6. Do you prefer a specific order or placement for the categories on the chart?

  7. Is there any specific range or limit you want to set for the ''redshift'' axis?

  8. Do you have any preference for the background color or theme of the chart?'
