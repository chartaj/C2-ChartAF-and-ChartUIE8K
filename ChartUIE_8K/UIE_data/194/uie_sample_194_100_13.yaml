initial_prompt: I need a grouped column chart using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14
  data. Plot 'u', 'g', 'r', 'i', 'z' magnitudes for different 'class' categories ('STAR',
  'GALAXY') on the x-axis. Each group represents a class, and each column within the
  group represents the different magnitudes (u, g, r, i, z). Use color coding to differentiate
  the magnitudes within each class. Don't forget to label the axes, include a legend,
  and title the chart. Ensure the chart clearly distinguishes between the star and
  galaxy data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the magnitudes
  (''u'', ''g'', ''r'', ''i'', ''z'') within each class?

  2. Would you like to include specific data labels on each column, such as the exact
  magnitude values?

  3. Do you have any preference regarding the format or style of the legend?

  4. Is there a particular style or font you would like to use for the chart title
  and axis labels?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, do you have a preference on their
  appearance (e.g., color, line style)?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, I would like gridlines. I do not have a preference on their appearance.

  6. I am not sure.'
