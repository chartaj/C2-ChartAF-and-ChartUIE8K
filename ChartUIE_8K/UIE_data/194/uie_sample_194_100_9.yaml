initial_prompt: Create a bullet chart using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 data
  to visualize the distribution of redshift values for different celestial objects
  categorized as 'STAR' and 'GALAXY'. Use the 'redshift' column for the primary measure,
  while utilizing the 'class' column for categorization. Reference the range of 'ra'
  (right ascension) values to depict variation across different sky coordinates. This
  chart should highlight how redshift varies for stars and galaxies and include benchmarks
  for 'ra' values to show if there are any significant shifts correlated with specific
  regions of sky coordinates.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  ''STAR'' and ''GALAXY'' categories?

  2. What benchmark values for ''ra'' (right ascension) would you like to include
  in the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific layout for the bullet chart, such as horizontal or vertical?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like the primary measure ''redshift'' to
  be displayed (e.g., specific range or scaling)?

  5. Should any specific labels or legends be included to aid interpretation of the
  chart?

  6. How detailed should the axis tick marks and gridlines be?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  8. Would you like to include error bars or any other indicators of variability for
  the ''redshift'' values?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  chart to highlight significant findings?

  10. Do you have a preference for the chart''s title and subtitle format?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the specific benchmark values for ''ra''.

  3. I have no specific preference for the layout, either horizontal or vertical is
  fine.

  4. I am not sure about the specific range or scaling for the ''redshift'' display.

  5. Yes, including labels or legends to aid interpretation would be helpful.

  6. I do not know how detailed the axis tick marks and gridlines should be.

  7. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  8. I am not sure about including error bars or other indicators of variability.

  9. I do not have any specific annotations or notes to include.

  10. I have no preference for the chart''s title and subtitle format.
