initial_prompt: I have data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 related to space
  and astronomy. I want to create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of some
  parameters. Specifically, I'd like to see how the 'g' and 'r' magnitudes are distributed
  for different 'class' categories ('STAR' and 'GALAXY'). The violin plot should have
  'class' on the x-axis and the magnitudes on the y-axis. Please ensure each class
  category is represented in the plot.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for differentiating between ''STAR''
  and ''GALAXY'' categories?

  2. Would you like to display a separate violin for the ''g'' and ''r'' magnitudes,
  or combine them into a single violin for each class?

  3. Should the plot include any specific summary statistics (e.g., mean, median)
  displayed within or alongside the violins?

  4. Do you have a preferred orientation for the violins (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Would you like the y-axis to be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  6. Should we include outliers on the plot, and if so, how should they be represented?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labels, titles, or annotations for the axes and the
  plot?

  8. Is there a specific format for the plot legends that you prefer?

  9. Are there any particular gridline styles or background themes you would like
  me to use for the plot?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the plot?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Linear scale, please.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific preferences for labels, titles, or annotations.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No specific preference for size or aspect ratio.'
