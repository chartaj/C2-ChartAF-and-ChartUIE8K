initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the IMDb votes per episode for the
  TV show. Each bar should represent an episode, with the height indicating the total
  votes. Use different colors to distinguish between seasons. Add text annotations
  for episodes with the highest and lowest votes to highlight their ratings. This
  visualization will help in understanding viewer preferences across different seasons
  and identify which episodes were most and least popular. The purpose is to provide
  an insightful look into audience engagement and preferences throughout the series.
  Include ratings and dates as additional context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different seasons?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  within each season?

  titles?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any additional context details you want to be included in the visualization,
  beyond ratings and dates?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or positioning of the legend on the
  chart?'
