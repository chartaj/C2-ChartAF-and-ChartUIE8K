initial_prompt: I'd like to create a column chart visualizing the "IMDB Votes per
  Episode" for the TV show data in the provided file. The chart should display the
  different episodes on the x-axis and the total number of votes each episode received
  on the y-axis. Make sure to include season information in the x-axis labels for
  clarity. Could you please generate this chart for me? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the column chart?

  2. Would you like the columns to be grouped or stacked by season?

  3. Should the chart include data labels displaying the vote count on each bar?

  4. Do you have a specific font preference for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, or is it unnecessary given the x-axis labels?

  6. Are there any specific gridline preferences (e.g., major or minor gridlines)?

  7. Should the chart''s title be centered or aligned differently?

  8. Would you like to have tooltips showing additional information when you hover
  over the columns?'
