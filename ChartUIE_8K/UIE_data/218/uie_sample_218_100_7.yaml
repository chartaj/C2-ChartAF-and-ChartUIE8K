initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart from the data provided in the CSV file,
  visualizing the distribution of different 'label' categories present in the 'headline'
  dataset. The chart should clearly show each category's percentage share of the total
  data points. Remember, the labels include values like 'Story', 'Partnership', and
  'Award', among others. This visualization will help us understand the primary focus
  areas of the SAP press releases at a glance. Make sure the chart is easy to interpret
  and visually appealing, with each slice labeled appropriately with both the label
  name and percentage.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend, or should the labels on the slices
  be sufficient?

  3. How detailed should the percentage labels be (e.g., whole numbers or one decimal
  place)?

  4. Are there any specific fonts you prefer for the labels and title?

  5. Should each slice have a border or outline for better distinction?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the categories to appear (e.g., in
  descending order of percentage)?

  7. Would you like to include the total number of data points on the chart?

  8. Do you want any additional text or annotation on the chart, such as a subtitle
  or note?'
