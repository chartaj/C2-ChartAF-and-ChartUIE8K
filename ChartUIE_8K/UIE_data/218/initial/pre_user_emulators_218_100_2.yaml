2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a column chart visualizing the number of press releases by category from
  the given SAP Press Releases data. The x-axis should represent the categories (label),
  and the y-axis should show the count of headlines in each category. Annotate the
  column bars to display the exact count of press releases for each category, highlighting
  the 'Story' category to emphasize its importance. This visualization aims to quickly
  convey the distribution of press releases across different categories to understand
  the company's focus areas in their communications.
