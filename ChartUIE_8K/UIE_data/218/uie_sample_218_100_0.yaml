initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different
  labels ('Story', 'Partnership', 'Award', etc.) in SAP press release headlines. Use
  text annotations to highlight the exact frequency values on top of each bar to emphasize
  the importance of particular labels. Highlight bars with fewer labels in a distinct
  color to draw attention to less common categories. This will help in understanding
  the distribution of topics in business-related press releases by SAP. Ensure the
  chart is visually appealing to effectively communicate insights at a glance for
  business stakeholders.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. What specific color would you like to use to highlight the bars with fewer labels?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  4. Are there any specific labels that should always be highlighted regardless of
  frequency?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the bar labels (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?

  6. Would you like to incorporate a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it
  to be placed?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the gridlines or background of the chart?

  8. Do you want any additional titles or subtitles on the chart? If yes, what should
  they be?

  9. Are there any specific details or styles you want for the axis labels?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart border or any additional chart styling
  elements?'
