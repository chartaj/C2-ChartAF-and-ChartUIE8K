initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot that visualizes the distribution of different
  labels (e.g., Story, Partnership, Award) from the SAP Press Releases dataset. I
  want to see how each label type varies in frequency. Ensure the x-axis represents
  the unique labels and the y-axis represents the count of headlines associated with
  each label. This will help me understand the distribution and density of headlines
  under each category. Use distinct colors for each label for clarity. Make sure the
  plot is detailed and easy to interpret. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each label type?

  2. What level of detail are you expecting in the plot? Would you like any specific
  statistical summaries to be included (e.g., median, quartiles)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the labels and titles in
  the chart?

  4. Are there any particular labels you''d like to highlight or differentiate in
  a unique way?

  5. Would you like the chart to include gridlines? If so, do you prefer major gridlines,
  minor gridlines, or both?

  6. How detailed should the axis labels be? Are you looking for precise numerical
  values or broader categories?

  7. Is there a preferred order for the labels on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  frequency-based)?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  plot?'

  2. I would like to see the median included in the plot.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  4. I have no specific labels to highlight.

  5. I prefer major gridlines included in the chart.

  6. Precise numerical values on the axis labels would be helpful.

  7. I prefer the labels to be ordered based on frequency.

  8. I do not know.'
