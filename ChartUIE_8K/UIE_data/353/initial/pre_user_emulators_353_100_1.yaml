2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a spline chart for the provided data, visualizing the trend of "VALUE"
  over time ("REPORTDATE"). Highlight significant peaks and troughs to emphasize variations
  in data, and annotate these critical points with their respective "VALUE" for clarity.
  The chart will help in understanding the financial fluctuations over the given period,
  which is crucial for business analysis and making informed strategic decisions.
  Use contrasting colors for highlights to ensure these details stand out clearly
  within the chart for better insight.
