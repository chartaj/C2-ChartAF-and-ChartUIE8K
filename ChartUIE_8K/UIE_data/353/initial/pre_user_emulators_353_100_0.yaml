2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a column chart to visualize the data summarized in the CSV file. The chart
  should display the 'REPORTDATE' on the x-axis and 'VALUE' on the y-axis. Use text
  annotations to highlight specific data points, like those on 30.12.2013, 31.12.2013,
  and 01.01.2014, showing their corresponding values. The data is business-related
  from a virtual internship at Sberbank, so the goal is to easily identify trends
  or significant changes over time. Use highlights to emphasize noteworthy dates or
  values, making it easier to spot patterns and draw insights.
