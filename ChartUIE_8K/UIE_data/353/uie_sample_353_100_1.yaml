initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart for the provided data, visualizing the
  trend of "VALUE" over time ("REPORTDATE"). Highlight significant peaks and troughs
  to emphasize variations in data, and annotate these critical points with their respective
  "VALUE" for clarity. The chart will help in understanding the financial fluctuations
  over the given period, which is crucial for business analysis and making informed
  strategic decisions. Use contrasting colors for highlights to ensure these details
  stand out clearly within the chart for better insight.
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the chart? \n2. Are\
  \ there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations?\n3. How\
  \ many significant peaks and troughs would you like to highlight?\n4. Do you have\
  \ specific dates or ranges where you expect significant peaks or troughs and want\
  \ us to focus on them?\n5. Would you prefer the annotations to be positioned in\
  \ a certain manner (e.g., above the peak, beneath the trough)?\n6. Should the x-axis\
  \ (REPORTDATE) have a specific date format or labeling frequency?\n7. How detailed\
  \ should the y-axis (VALUE) be in terms of labeling and scaling?\n8. Are there any\
  \ specific legends or titles you'd like to include in the chart?\n9. Would you like\
  \ grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?\n10. Should the\
  \ highlighted peaks and troughs have a specific symbol or marker style?"
