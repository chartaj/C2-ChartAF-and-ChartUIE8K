initial_prompt: I want to create a choropleth map visualizing forest fires in Brazil
  by year and state. The dataset includes columns for year, state, month, number of
  fires, and date. I want the map to show which states have had the most and least
  fires over the years, with various color intensities representing different numbers
  of fires. Can you also show this data month by month for more insights on seasonal
  patterns? The map should be interactive, allowing for filtering by year and month.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for representing the
  intensity of fires?

  2. Is there a particular map projection you would like to use for Brazil?

  3. Do you prefer to include state boundaries and labels on the map?

  4. Would you like to display the actual numbers of fires when hovering over a state
  or region?

  5. Are there any specific legends or annotations you want to include on the map?

  6. Do you prefer displaying data for all years and months by default, or should
  there be a specific initial default view?

  7. How do you want to handle the representation of monthsâ€”should they be represented
  as individual maps for each month or as an aggregated view?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and titles on
  the map?'
