initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of forest fires
  in Brazil over the years. Use the "number" column to show the spread and variability
  of forest fire counts across different years. Highlight the states with the highest
  and lowest number of fires to emphasize significant differences. Annotate specific
  years where there were unusual spikes or drops in fire numbers to draw attention
  to these events. This will help in understanding trends and outliers in forest fire
  occurrences in various Brazilian states. Ensure that the chart is easy to interpret
  for environmental scientists and policymakers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting states with the
  highest and lowest number of fires?

  2. Would you like to include specific tools or methods for annotating spikes or
  drops in fire numbers (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  3. Do you prefer displaying the data for each year individually or aggregated over
  a few years?

  4. Would you like the box chart to display data points (outliers) outside of the
  whiskers?

  5. Do you have preferences for labels or titles on the axes?

  6. Would you prefer a grid background to aid in data interpretation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
