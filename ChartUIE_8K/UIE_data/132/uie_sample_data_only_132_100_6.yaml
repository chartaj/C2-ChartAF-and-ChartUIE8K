02_initial_prompt: I want a bar chart displaying the number of forest fires in Brazil
  from 1998 to 2000. Use the 'state' as the category axis and the 'number' as the
  value axis. Each bar should represent the total number of fires per state annually.
  Additionally, include different colors for each year so I can easily compare the
  data. Make sure to label the axes clearly and provide a legend to differentiate
  the years. Also, include a title "Annual Forest Fires in Brazilian States" to give
  context to the chart. Thank you!

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
