initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the forest fire data for Brazil
  over the years. Could you create a chart using the 'year' on the x-axis and 'number'
  of fires on the y-axis? Please differentiate the points by 'state' using different
  colors and include a legend. It would be nice to also have tooltips showing the
  specific 'month' and 'date' for each point. This will help to understand the temporal
  and geographic distribution of the forest fires better. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the states?

  2. What specific details would you like to see in the tooltips, along with ''month''
  and ''date''?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or size of the legend?

  4. Would you like the chart to have a title? If yes, what should it be?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis titles?

  6. Should grid lines be included on the chart? If yes, do you have any preference
  for their style?

  7. Do you want any specific annotation or highlights for certain years or states?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. ''Month'' and ''date'' details would be fine.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Forest Fires in Brazil Over the Years."

  5. X-axis title: "Year", Y-axis title: "Number of Fires."

  6. Yes, please include grid lines. I am not sure about the style.

  7. I do not have any specific annotations or highlights in mind.'
