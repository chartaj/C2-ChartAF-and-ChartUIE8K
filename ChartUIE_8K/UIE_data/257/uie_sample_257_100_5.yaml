initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart that visualizes the COVID-19 Complete
  Blood Count (CBC) Database. Please include the 'Patient Age' on the x-axis and stack
  the bars by 'Outcome' (Recovered, Not Recovered). Use different colors for each
  'Outcome'. For each patient, display the 'Platelet Count', 'Lymphocyte Count', and
  'Neutrophils Count' as the segments within the bars, with a legend to differentiate
  them. This will help in comparing the blood count parameters among patients with
  different outcomes across varying age groups.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to represent the different
  ''Outcomes'' (Recovered, Not Recovered)?

  3. Would you like to define specific age group bins on the x-axis or use individual
  ages as the x-axis categories?

  4. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the segments within the bars (e.g., ''Platelet
  Count'' at the bottom)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, in which orientation (vertical,
  horizontal, or both)?

  7. Would you like to annotate any specific data points or segments within the bars?

  8. Is there a specific style or placement you prefer for the legend?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the axis titles and labels formatting (e.g.,
  orientation, style)?

  10. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to indicate specific
  thresholds or ranges?'
