initial_prompt: I want a line chart displaying COVID-19 patient outcomes over time.
  Use the 'Admission_DATE', 'Discharge_DATE or date of Death', and 'Outcome' fields.
  Highlight the different treatment types on the chart using colors and annotations
  to show the 'Recovered' vs 'Not Recovered' outcomes. Emphasize age and gender differences
  with separate lines or markers. Include text annotations for significant data points,
  like highest or lowest values of 'Red blood cell distribution width', 'Monocytes(%)',
  and other CBC parameters. This is for a medical report on patient treatment efficacy.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different treatment
  types and outcomes?

  2. Do you want separate charts for ''Recovered'' and ''Not Recovered'' outcomes
  or combined in one chart with color differentiation?

  3. How would you like genders to be represented: with different line styles, colors,
  or markers?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for annotating significant data points (e.g.,
  font size, color, or style)?

  5. Should age groups be segmented in a specific way (e.g., by decade)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall style of the line chart (e.g., classic,
  modern, minimalistic)?

  7. Would you like any specific summary statistics or trend lines included on the
  chart?

  8. Is there a specific way you would like the axes to be labeled or scaled?'
