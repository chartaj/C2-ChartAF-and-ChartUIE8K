initial_prompt: '<start of user instructions>

  I have a dataset from a COVID-19 Complete Blood Count (CBC) database and I''m interested
  in a scatter plot visualization. I want to see the relationship between "Patient
  Age" and "Neutrophils Count". Can you create a scatter plot that shows "Patient
  Age" on the x-axis and "Neutrophils Count" on the y-axis? Use different colors or
  markers for the "Outcome" category to distinguish between "Recovered" and "Not Recovered"
  patients. This will help me understand if there''s any correlation between age and
  neutrophil levels. Thank you!
