initial_prompt: 'Compare age-wise COVID-19 blood test results using a grouped bar
  chart highlighting key variables: RBC distribution width, WBC count, platelet, lymphocyte,
  and neutrophil counts. Annotate significant differences to illustrate recovery outcomes
  visually.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different age groups in the
  grouped bar chart?

  2. Do you have a specific order for the age groups you would like to see on the
  x-axis?

  3. How many age groups would you like to compare, and do you have specific age ranges
  in mind?

  4. Should the bars within each group be sorted in any specific order (e.g., ascending
  or descending)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the axes and legend?

  6. Do you have a preferred font size and style for annotations and labels within
  the chart?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If so, would you prefer
  them to be dotted, solid, or another style?

  8. Should the chart include error bars to indicate variability or confidence intervals
  for the data points?

  9. Are there any specific significant differences or thresholds that should be annotated
  in a particular way?

  10. Do you have any preferred software or tool for creating the chart (e.g., Excel,
  Tableau, matplotlib)?'
