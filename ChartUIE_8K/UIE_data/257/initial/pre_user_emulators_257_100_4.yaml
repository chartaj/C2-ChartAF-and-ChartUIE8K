  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Box chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Box chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of key blood count metrics among
  COVID-19 patients. Use the columns "Red blood cell distribution width," "Monocytes(%),"
  "White blood cell count," "Platelet Count," "Lymphocyte Count," and "Neutrophils
  Count." Highlight differences across gender and recovery outcomes ("Outcome"). Ensure
  the chart effectively compares these metrics for "Male" vs. "Female" and "Recovered"
  vs. "Not Recovered." Title the chart "CBC Metrics Distribution in COVID-19 Patients."
  Labels should be clear and colors distinct. This will help in understanding variations
  in blood counts related to patient demographics and recovery outcomes.
