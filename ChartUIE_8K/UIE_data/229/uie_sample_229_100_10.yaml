  Please include columns for Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, and Active
  Cases for each country listed. Each country should be represented on the x-axis,
  and the number of cases or deaths on the y-axis. I want to compare how different
  countries have been impacted by Covid-19. Ensure to label the axes and include a
  legend for clarity. The title of the chart should be "Covid-19 Cases and Deaths
  Worldwide". Please make the chart visually clear and informative.
