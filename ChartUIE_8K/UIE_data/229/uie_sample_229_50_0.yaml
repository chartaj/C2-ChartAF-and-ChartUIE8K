initial_prompt: Create a pie chart showing the distribution of total COVID-19 cases
  by country. Highlight the top three countries (USA, India, France) and use text
  annotations to display the exact figures. Ensure the pie chart visually represents
  the substantial differences among countries, aiding in understanding global case
  distribution.

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text annotations?

  4. Would you like any specific design elements (e.g., borders, shadows) for the
  highlighted countries (USA, India, France)?

  5. Should the top three countries be displayed in a different way (e.g., separate
  pie chart sections, different colors)?

  6. Do you want data labels to show absolute numbers, percentages, or both?

  7. Do you prefer any specific order for the country slices (e.g., descending order
  of total cases)?

  8. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the pie chart?

  9. Are there additional countries you want to highlight beyond the top three?

  10. Is there any specific background color or image you want to be used for the
  pie chart?'
