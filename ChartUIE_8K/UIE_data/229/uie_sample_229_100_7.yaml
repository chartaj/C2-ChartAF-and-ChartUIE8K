initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize Covid cases and deaths worldwide.
  Use the countries as the x-axis and include bars for Total Cases, Total Deaths,
  and Total Recovered for each country. Make sure to use different colors for each
  bar category to distinguish them clearly. Also, ensure the y-axis accurately represents
  the numerical values. Apostrophes or quotes around the numbers are not necessary.
  Additionally, consider adding data labels on the bars to show the exact count for
  better clarity. Your chart should comprehensively display comparison while keeping
  it simple and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors to be used for
  the Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered bars?

  2. Would you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  3. Should the countries be sorted in any particular order, such as alphabetically
  or by the number of cases?

  4. How detailed would you like the data labels to be? Should they include separators
  like commas for thousands?

  5. Is there a specific range or limit you want for the y-axis?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to help differentiate between the bars, or is
  the color distinction enough?

  7. Would you prefer any specific style or positioning for the axis titles?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability? If so, horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  9. How would you like to handle countries with missing data for any of the categories
  (Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered)?'
