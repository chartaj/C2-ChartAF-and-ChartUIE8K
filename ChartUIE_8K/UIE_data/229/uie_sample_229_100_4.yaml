initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the Covid-19 pandemic's impact worldwide
  using the provided dataset. The x-axis should represent countries, and the y-axis
  should denote the number of cases, deaths, and recoveries. Plot separate lines for
  'Total Cases,' 'Total Deaths,' and 'Total Recovered' to clearly show the trends
  over different countries. Highlight data points where 'Total Deaths' are notably
  high. Ensure to handle any missing data appropriately and label each axis clearly.
  The chart should convey how different countries have been affected by Covid-19 in
  terms of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Should the countries on the x-axis be in alphabetical order or ordered by the
  number of cases, deaths, or recoveries?

  3. Would you prefer logarithmic or linear scaling on the y-axis?

  4. Do you want specific countries or data points to be highlighted aside from those
  with notably high ''Total Deaths''?

  5. How would you like the missing data to be handled (e.g., interpolate, leave gaps,
  mark explicitly)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add for clarity?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the chart area, and do you have
  a preferred position?

  9. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  10. Are there any specific countries you want to exclude from the visualization?'
