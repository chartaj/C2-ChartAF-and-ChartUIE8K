initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Total Cases,
  Total Deaths, Total Recovered, and Active Cases for different countries. We want
  to see the spread and variation in these metrics globally, highlighting outliers,
  median values, and quartiles. This will help in understanding variations and trends
  in Covid-19 impact across countries. Make sure to label the axes clearly and use
  different colors for each metric. Also, include a legend for easy identification.
  The population data can be used to normalize the values if necessary.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for each metric?

  2. Would you like the values to be normalized by population for a fair comparison?

  3. Is there a specific order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  (e.g., by total cases, alphabetically)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the typeface or font size used for axis labels and
  legends?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines or any specific annotations for better readability?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for color schemes.

  2. Yes, please normalize the values by population for a fair comparison.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference for typeface or font size.

  5. I do not know. Adding gridlines might help with readability, though.'
