initial_prompt: '"I need a heatmap visualizing COVID-19 data globally. It should display
  the intensity of total cases, total deaths, and total recovered for each country.
  Highlight countries with the highest and lowest values in different colors. Make
  sure to also reflect the population size on the heatmap. Missing values should be
  indicated. The chart should provide insights into how different countries are handling
  the pandemic relative to their population. Please ensure the data is visible and
  clear, including labels for each country."'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific color schemes for highlighting
  the highest and lowest values?

  2. Would you like the countries to be labeled directly on the heatmap, or would
  you prefer a hover label/pop-up?

  3. Is there a preferred size or resolution for the heatmap to ensure clarity and
  readability?

  4. How would you like missing values to be indicated (e.g., using a specific color
  or pattern)?

  5. Do you have any preference for the scale or normalization method for the intensity
  representation?

  6. Would you like the population size to be reflected in the intensity calculation,
  or should it be displayed as a separate visual element (e.g., size of the heatmap
  cell)?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color intensities and what
  they represent?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and annotations on
  the heatmap?

  9. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be emphasized or focused
  on in the heatmap?

  10. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap, such as starting from the most
  affected countries or following a specific geographic orientation?'
