initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map that visualizes Covid cases and deaths worldwide.
  Use the data to highlight each country based on the total number of cases, with
  a color gradient to represent the severity. Display additional information such
  as total deaths, total recovered, and active cases when hovering over each country.
  The map should also indicate the total number of tests conducted and population
  for context. Ensure data is visually compelling and easy to interpret for global
  comparison, considering missing values for accurate representation. The map should
  be interactive to allow for detailed exploration per country.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used to
  represent the severity of Covid cases?

  2. Would you prefer a particular color scheme for representing total deaths, total
  recovered, and active cases upon hovering?

  3. How would you like missing values to be displayed or handled in the visualization?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  etc.)?

  5. Is there any specific font style or size you would like for the labels and annotations
  on the map?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for displaying contextual information
  such as total tests conducted and population?'

  1. I am not sure, but something that is easily distinguishable.

  2. I have no specific preference, just make sure they are easy to differentiate.

  3. I am not sure how best to handle it; maybe a neutral color or a pattern.

  4. I do not know, any commonly used one is fine.

  5. I do not have a specific preference, but ensure itâ€™s readable.

  6. No specific layout, just ensure it doesn''t clutter the map.
