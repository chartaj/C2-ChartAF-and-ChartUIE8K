initial_prompt: Please create a Bubble chart to visualize the worldwide Covid-19 data.
  I want the "Country" on the x-axis and "Population" on the y-axis. The size of the
  bubbles should represent "Total Cases", and the color should represent "Total Deaths".
  This will help me understand the Covid-19 impact in different countries, correlating
  population size with reported cases and deaths. Ensure missing values are handled
  appropriately, possibly by using averages or median values to fill gaps.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubbles?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the bubbles?

  3. How would you prefer to handle the missing values: using averages or median values?

  4. Do you want any gridlines on the chart?

  5. What title would you like for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  7. Should there be a legend to explain the bubble sizes and colors?

  8. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or focus on in the chart?

  9. Would you like to include a descriptive caption or summary below the chart?'
