initial_prompt: Please create an Area Chart using the provided Covid-19 dataset to
  visualize the trends in Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered across different
  countries. Highlight the USA, India, and France to emphasize their data. Use text
  annotations to indicate specific values for these highlighted countries, such as
  Total Cases and Total Deaths. The chart should help viewers understand the global
  impact of Covid-19, focusing on major contributors. Make sure to handle any missing
  values appropriately and provide clear legends and labels for better comprehension.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart?

  any additional information?

  4. Do you have a preference for where the legends and labels should be placed on
  the chart?

  and labels?

  want to focus on?'
