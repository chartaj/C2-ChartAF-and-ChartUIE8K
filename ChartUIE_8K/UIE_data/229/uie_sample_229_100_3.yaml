initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of 'Total Cases'
  and 'Total Deaths' by country for the dataset 'Covid Cases and Deaths Worldwide'.
  The data appears to include total cases, deaths, and other relevant information
  for various countries. I want to see how the total cases and total deaths vary across
  different countries. Additionally, please address the missing values accordingly
  so that they do not distort the histogram. Make sure the histogram reflects accurate
  counts and provides a clear comparison between countries. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like to display the histogram as separate plots for ''Total Cases''
  and ''Total Deaths'' or combined into a single plot?

  3. Should the histogram include labels for individual countries on the x-axis?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the range of the y-axis?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between ''Total Cases'' and
  ''Total Deaths''?

  6. Do you prefer any particular style or font for the titles and labels?

  7. Should the histogram include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Do you have preferences for the bin width or number of bins in the histogram?

  9. Would you like to address the missing values by imputing them or excluding the
  affected countries from the visualization?

  10. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., horizontal
  vs. vertical)?'
