initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize worldwide Covid data.
  Each bar represents a country (e.g., USA, India, France) with segments showing Total
  Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, and Total Tests. Highlight differences
  among countries and identify trends. Use distinct colors for each segment and ensure
  the population is labeled on the x-axis. The data has missing values so handle them
  appropriately. Opt for data from '229.csv' and focus on practicality and readability,
  making it easy to compare Covid metrics across nations effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the specific colors used for each segment
  (Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Total Tests) in the stacked
  bar chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific title for the chart?

  3. Do you prefer the population label on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific
  format, such as commas for thousands?

  4. Are there any specific countries you would like to focus on or highlight in the
  chart?

  5. How would you prefer the missing values to be handled (e.g., omitted, estimated,
  or indicated in some way)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the order in which the segments (Total Cases,
  Total Deaths, Total Recovered, Active Cases, Total Tests) should be stacked?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included on the chart, and if so, where should
  it be positioned?

  8. Do you have any specific font or style preferences for the labels and titles
  in the chart?'
