initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization for the "Bacteria Dataset" showcasing
  the distribution of bacteria families and their harmfulness to humans. Each rectangle
  should represent a bacterial family with color coding to indicate whether they are
  harmful or not. Use labeled sections for clear identification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific color schemes to use for indicating
  harmful and non-harmful bacteria?

  2. What level of detail do you want in the labels for each bacterial family?

  3. Do you need any additional annotations or legends in the visualization?

  4. Should the treemap size be proportional to the number of bacteria in each family,
  or do you have another metric in mind for sizing the rectangles?

  5. Are there any specific bacteria families you want to highlight or emphasize in
  the treemap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. The labels should clearly identify each bacterial family.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No, I have no specific preference.'
