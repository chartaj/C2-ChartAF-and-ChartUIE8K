initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of bacteria
  found in different locations (Where Found) categorized by whether they are harmful
  to humans or not. The X-axis should represent the various places where the bacteria
  are found, and the Y-axis should show the count of bacteria in each location. The
  bars should be stacked to differentiate between harmful and non-harmful bacteria.
  Additionally, color-code the parts of the bar to clearly separate harmful ("Yes")
  and non-harmful ("No") bacteria for better visualization. This is for a biology
  project on bacteria.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the harmful and non-harmful
  bacteria categories?

  2. Would you like to include labels on the Y-axis to show the exact count of bacteria
  for each segment in the bar?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the "Where Found" locations on the X-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical, by frequency)?

  4. Should there be a specific title for the chart?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color-coding for harmful and
  non-harmful bacteria?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?'
