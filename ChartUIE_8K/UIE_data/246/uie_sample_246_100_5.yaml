initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart for the Bacteria Dataset. Use the 'Harmful to
  Humans' column to categorize the data. Then, plot the 'Where Found' data within
  each 'Harmful to Humans' category to show the distribution of bacteria locations.
  This will help visualize where harmful vs. non-harmful bacteria are commonly found.
  Include a legend to differentiate the categories.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the categories in the legend?

  2. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific styling or formatting for the axis labels?

  4. Is there a particular order you would like the ''Harmful to Humans'' categories
  to be displayed in?

  5. Would you like the box plots to have any specific notations, such as median or
  quartile values?

  6. How detailed should the ''Where Found'' data be in the visualization (e.g., show
  all locations distinctly or group similar ones)?

  7. Is there any specific title or caption you would like on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, I would like the median values noted.

  6. Show all locations distinctly.

  7. No specific title or caption is needed.

  8. I do not have any specific preferences for the size or aspect ratio.'
