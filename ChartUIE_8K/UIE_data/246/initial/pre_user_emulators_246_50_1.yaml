2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap visualizing bacterial presence across different environments. Highlight
  harmful bacteria to humans. Annotate bacterial names and their families in selected
  cells for clarity. This helps understand and focus on potentially dangerous bacteria
  in varying environments efficiently.
