initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing bacterial presence across different environments.
  Highlight harmful bacteria to humans. Annotate bacterial names and their families
  in selected cells for clarity. This helps understand and focus on potentially dangerous
  bacteria in varying environments efficiently.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting harmful bacteria?

  2. Should certain environments be emphasized more than others in the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer the names and families to be shown as tooltips or displayed directly
  on the cells?

  4. Would you like varying shades or specific colors to indicate the presence intensity
  of bacteria?

  5. Is there a preferred order for listing environments, such as by relevance, alphabetical,
  or frequency?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color codes and annotations used
  in the heatmap?

  7. Are there specific harmful bacteria you are primarily interested in highlighting?

  8. Do you have a preference for the size or layout of the heatmap to fit a specific
  display or publication format?'

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I prefer the names and families to be shown directly on the cells.
