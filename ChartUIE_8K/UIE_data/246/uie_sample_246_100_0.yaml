initial_prompt: Create a bar chart from the bacteria dataset showing the number of
  unique bacteria found in different locations ('Where Found'). Add text annotations
  to indicate the count of bacteria for each location. Additionally, use highlights
  to differentiate bacteria that are harmful to humans. The chart should help in understanding
  the distribution and potential risk areas of bacteria.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for differentiating harmful
  and non-harmful bacteria?

  2. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal bars in the bar chart?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for text annotations?

  4. Is there a preferred order for the locations on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by count)?

  5. Are there any specific title or axis labels you would like to be used for the
  chart?

  6. Should we include a legend to explain the highlighted bars for harmful bacteria?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the background color or style of the chart?'

  3. I do not know.

  4. By count.
