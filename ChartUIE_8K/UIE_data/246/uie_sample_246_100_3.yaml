initial_prompt: Given the Bacteria Dataset, I need a Choropleth map that will visualize
  the "Where Found" data. The map should display different regions (such as different
  parts of the body or environments) where specific bacteria are commonly found. The
  regions on the map should be color-coded to represent the density or frequency of
  different bacteria types found in each location. The map should also allow me to
  hover over each region to get more detailed information about the specific bacteria,
  including their name, family, and whether they are harmful to humans. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color scheme for the map?

  2. Would you like the colors to indicate frequency categories (e.g., low, medium,
  high) or a gradient scale for density?

  3. Do you prefer a legend on the side or at the bottom of the map?

  4. Are there any specific regions or environments that you want to be highlighted
  or made more prominent on the map?

  5. Should the hover information be displayed as a tooltip or a side panel?

  6. Do you want the bacteria names to be displayed by default on the map, or only
  when hovering?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text on the map?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the map (e.g.,
  indicating particularly harmful bacteria)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer the legend on the side.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Tooltip is fine.

  6. Only when hovering.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I would like to include markers indicating particularly harmful bacteria.'
