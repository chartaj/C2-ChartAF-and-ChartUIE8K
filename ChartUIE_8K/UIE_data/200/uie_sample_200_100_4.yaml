initial_prompt: I want a stacked bar chart to visualize students' academic performance
  against their gender. Each bar should represent different academic performance levels
  (e.g., Average, Excellent), and sections should be divided based on gender (Male,
  Female). Additionally, each section should further be divided to showcase the depression
  status of students (Sometimes, Yes, No). This will help us understand any potential
  correlation between gender, academic performance, and depression status among students.
  Title the chart "Academic Performance vs. Gender and Depression Status in Students."
  Ensure to include all relevant labels and a legend to distinguish gender and depression
  status.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for representing different
  genders?

  2. Do you prefer any particular colors for the sections representing different depression
  statuses?

  3. Should the bars be arranged in a specific order, such as by academic performance
  level or gender?

  4. Would you like a specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Should the chart include data values within the bars for better readability?

  7. Do you need any specific gridlines or axis lines to be included or emphasized?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to emphasize key points
  or thresholds?

  9. Should there be any particular spacing or width preferences for the bars in the
  chart?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart to provide context or explanations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. No specific preference.

  3. Arrange the bars by academic performance level.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Position the legend at the bottom.

  6. Yes, include data values within the bars for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No particular spacing or width preferences.

  10. No additional annotations or notes.
