initial_prompt: Create a heatmap depicting the relationship between different psychosocial
  dimensions of student life. Specifically, show correlations among Age, Gender, Academic
  Performance, Note-taking in Class, Depression Status, Challenges in Completing Academic
  Tasks, Preference for Presentations, Sleep per Day, Number of Friends, and Interest
  in New Things. Annotate significant data points to highlight unique patterns and
  possible depression triggers related to academic performance and social behaviors.
  Highlight the cells with missing data in the Number of Friends column to address
  data completeness and reliability in the context of psychological assessments.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display correlation coefficients or just color gradients to
  represent correlations?

  3. How would you like the significant data points to be annotated (e.g., with specific
  labels, symbols, or values)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for highlighting cells with missing data in
  the Number of Friends column (e.g., specific color, pattern, or both)?

  5. Should there be any specific thresholds for highlighting significant correlations?

  6. Is there a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., symmetrical, organized in
  a certain order)?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the addition of gridlines or separators
  between cells?

  8. Would you prefer to include additional summary statistics or information within
  the heatmap or as a separate legend?

  9. Is there a need for any specific font style or size for annotations and labels?

  10. Should there be a title or labels for the axes, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for what they should say?

  11. Are there any particular tools or software you''re familiar with for viewing
  or editing the heatmap?'
