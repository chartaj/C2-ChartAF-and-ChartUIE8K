initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between students'
  sleep per day hours and the number of friends they have. Plot "SleepPerDayHours"
  on the x-axis and "NumberOfFriend" on the y-axis. Use different colors to indicate
  "AcademicPerformance" categories like 'Excellent', 'Average', etc. Include a legend
  to distinguish between these performance categories. This will help in understanding
  how sleep duration correlates with social interactions and academic outcomes among
  students in the context of their psychosocial dimensions. Use appropriate titles
  and labels for clarity.
