initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of "SleepPerDayHours"
  for different "Gender" categories. Use "SleepPerDayHours" as the numeric variable
  and "Gender" as the categorical variable. This will help us understand the range,
  median, and any potential outliers in the sleep patterns of male and female students
  within the dataset. Include axis labels and a title that reflects the data's focus
  on the relationship between gender and sleeping hours among students. The insight
  will help in understanding how sleep patterns may vary psychosocially based on gender.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included or omitted?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  4. Would you like to include individual data points overlaid on the box plot?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Vertical orientation, please.'
