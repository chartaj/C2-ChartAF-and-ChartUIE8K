initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the `SleepPerDayHours` of students
  from the dataset. The x-axis should represent the number of hours students sleep
  per day, and the y-axis should show the frequency of each sleep duration. This will
  help understand how many hours the majority of students sleep and identify patterns
  in their sleep habits. Please ensure the histogram is based on the data provided
  under the `SleepPerDayHours` column. I am particularly interested in understanding
  the distribution of sleep hours among students. Can you generate this chart for
  me?
questions: '1. Do you have a specific range you would like for the x-axis (number
  of hours students sleep per day)?

  2. How many bins would you prefer for the histogram?

  3. Do you have a preferred color for the bars in the histogram?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you want to include labels on the x-axis and y-axis, and if so, what should
  they be?

  6. Should the title of the histogram be ''Distribution of Sleep Hours Among Students''
  or would you prefer a different title?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines on the chart.

  5. Yes, please include labels on the x-axis and y-axis: x-axis ''Hours of Sleep
  per Day'', y-axis ''Frequency''.

  6. The title ''Distribution of Sleep Hours Among Students'' is fine.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.'
