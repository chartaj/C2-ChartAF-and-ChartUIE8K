initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize customer purchase behavior. Plot
  'AnnualIncome' on the x-axis and 'NumberOfPurchases' on the y-axis. Use 'ProductCategory'
  as the color dimension to distinguish between different product categories. Additionally,
  use different marker sizes for 'TimeSpentOnWebsite' to represent how much time customers
  spend on the website. This chart should help us identify any patterns or trends
  in customer income and purchase behavior across different product categories and
  website engagement times for predicting future purchase behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you would
  like to use for different product categories?

  2. Would you like to set specific sizes for the markers representing ''TimeSpentOnWebsite'',
  or should they be scaled proportionally?

  3. Is there a particular range or set of values you would like to highlight on the
  ''AnnualIncome'' or ''NumberOfPurchases'' axes?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the marker sizes and colors used?

  6. Is there a need to include grid lines for better readability of the plot?

  7. Would you like to add trend lines or any other statistical annotations to the
  scatter plot?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or subtitles of the chart?

  9. Are there any specific data points you wish to highlight or annotate in the scatter
  plot?'
