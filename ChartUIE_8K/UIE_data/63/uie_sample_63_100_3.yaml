initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart that illustrates the average annual income grouped
  by the number of purchases. Each bar should represent a different number of purchases,
  and the height of the bar should indicate the average annual income for customers
  with that specific number of purchases. This chart will help us understand whether
  there's a correlation between the number of purchases a customer makes and their
  annual income. Please use the "NumberOfPurchases" for the x-axis and "AnnualIncome"
  for the y-axis. Make sure to include labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. Would you like the y-axis to display values in a specific format (e.g., currency)?

  3. Should the chart include a title? If so, what should it be?

  4. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Do you need gridlines or background shading in the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the average values be displayed as data labels on top of each bar?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order in which the bars are displayed (e.g.,
  ascending or descending by the number of purchases)?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or callouts to highlight specific insights?

  9. Do you prefer the x-axis labels to be oriented horizontally or vertically for
  better readability?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to include in
  the chart, such as a legend or caption?'
