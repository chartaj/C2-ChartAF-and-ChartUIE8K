initial_prompt: I'd like to create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of customer
  purchases across different product categories based on the `ProductCategory` column
  in the dataset. I want to see the percentage each category contributes to the total
  number of purchases. This will help me understand which product categories are the
  most and least popular among customers. By knowing the popularity of each category,
  I can make more informed decisions about inventory and marketing strategies. Please
  use the `NumberOfPurchases` data to ensure the chart accurately reflects the distribution.
  Thank you!
questions: '- Do you have any preferred color schemes or specific colors you want
  to use for each product category in the pie chart?

  - Would you like to display the percentage value on each segment of the pie chart?

  - Do you want to include labels for each product category directly on the pie chart
  or in a legend?

  - Would you prefer the pie chart to be in 2D or 3D?

  - Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and percentages?

  - Would you like to see the chart title, and if so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  - Should the chart include data source information or any additional annotations?
