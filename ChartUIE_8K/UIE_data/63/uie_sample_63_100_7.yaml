initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between Age and Annual
  Income in the dataset "üõçÔ∏è Predict Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset". Each dot
  should represent a different individual, with the x-axis representing Age and the
  y-axis representing Annual Income. Highlight different Product Categories by using
  different colors for the dots. Additionally, use shapes to distinguish between genders.
  This will help us analyze how income varies with age across different product preferences
  and gender. Ensure the plot is clear and includes labels for both axes, a legend
  for colors and shapes, and a title.

  Categories?

  minor, or both?

  8. Are there any specific data points or ranges that you would like to be emphasized
  or highlighted?

  9. Would you like tooltips or data labels to be included for each dot?
