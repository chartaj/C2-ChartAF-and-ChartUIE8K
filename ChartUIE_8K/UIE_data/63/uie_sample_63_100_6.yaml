initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different variables
  in the "Predict Customer Purchase Behavior Dataset." Focus on examining how age,
  gender, annual income, number of purchases, product category, time spent on the
  website, loyalty program participation, and discounts availed are related to the
  purchase status. This chart will help identify which factors most strongly influence
  whether a customer makes a purchase. Make sure the heatmap clearly shows correlations,
  making it easy to identify positive and negative relationships within the data.
  Use distinct color gradients to denote varying levels of correlation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for denoting varying
  levels of correlation?

  2. Would you like to include labels on the heatmap cells to show the exact correlation
  values?

  3. How would you prefer to handle any potential issues with overlapping text or
  crowded labels?

  4. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  5. Is there a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., square, rectangular)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient and corresponding
  correlation values?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type and size for the labels
  and title?

  8. How would you like to arrange the variables on the axes (e.g., any specific order
  or based on the strength of correlation)?

  9. Are there any additional text or annotations you would like to include on the
  heatmap?'
