initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the relationship between
  ProductCategory and PurchaseStatus. Annotate the columns with specific values, focusing
  on differences in PurchaseStatus among categories. Highlight categories with higher

  chart?

  4. How would you like to order the product categories on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by the number of purchases)?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines in the background of the chart?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Would you like to add a legend to the chart to explain the different purchase
  statuses?

  8. Do you want to incorporate any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Should there be any axis titles included in the chart?
