initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing the average values of 'mcg', 'gvh', 'lip',
  'chg', 'aac', 'alm1', and 'alm2'. Highlight bars with significantly higher or lower
  averages to emphasize key differences. Annotate specific bars with their exact average
  values to draw attention. The purpose of this visualization is to quickly identify
  which metrics deviate from the norm, providing insight into genomic characteristics
  within the Ecoli data set. Annotations guide the focus to critical data points,
  enhancing understanding of the datasetâ€™s distribution. Ensure the chart is clear
  and informative for genomics research.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bar chart?

  2. Should the chart have a title? If so, what title would you prefer?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations?

  5. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal bars in the bar chart?

  6. Do you need the values on the Y-axis to have a specific range or scale?

  7. Should the chart include any legends or labels for better understanding?

  8. Do you want to display confidence intervals or error bars for the average values?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the highlighted significant bars to be
  marked (e.g., different color, bold outline)?

  10. Are there any specific instructions for the placement of annotations on the
  bars?'
