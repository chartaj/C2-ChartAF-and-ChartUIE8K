initial_prompt: 'Let''s create a Parallel Coordinates chart to visualize the genomics
  data from the Ecoli Data Set. We will focus on the columns: mcg, gvh, lip, chg,
  aac, alm1, and alm2. The chart should highlight data points with specific range
  values or patterns. Include annotations to display important values and trends for
  selected sequences, such as maxima or minima. This visualization will help in comparing
  and identifying correlations between different attributes in the Ecoli sequences.
  Ensure the chart is clear and color-coded to distinguish different sequences. Add
  labels for better context and interpretation.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for distinguishing different
  sequences?

  2. Are there particular range values or patterns you want to highlight within the
  data points?

  3. Which important values or trends do you want annotated â€“ maxima, minima, or both?

  4. Do you prefer a specific type of labeling for context and interpretation (e.g.,
  axis labels, legend labels, data point labels)?

  5. Would you like the chart to display any specific statistical summaries (e.g.,
  mean, median) for each attribute?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference for distinguishing different
  sequences.

  2. I am not sure, but highlighting any noticeable ranges or extreme values would
  be helpful.

  3. Both maxima and minima would be great to annotate.

  4. Axis labels and legend labels would be sufficient.

  5. I do not know if specific statistical summaries are needed, but basic ones like
  mean or median could be useful if it helps with interpretation.'
