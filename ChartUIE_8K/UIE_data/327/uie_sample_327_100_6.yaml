initial_prompt: I'd like to create a heatmap visualizing the missing values across
  different columns in my Ecoli dataset. The heatmap should highlight which columns
  have the most missing data. Use the columns 'Sequence Name', 'mcg', 'gvh', 'lip',
  'chg', 'aac', 'alm1', and 'alm2' from the dataset to create the heatmap. This will
  help me quickly identify areas with missing information that might need further
  attention. Make sure the heatmap is clearly labeled and easy to understand. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preferred color to represent missing values in the heatmap?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to display a color legend?

  4. Should the heatmap include titles and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  preferences for the titles?

  5. Do you want the heatmap to include numerical annotations within the cells?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for text within the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall size and dimensions of the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to add gridlines or separators within the heatmap cells?

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to be in a horizontal or vertical orientation?

  10. Should the heatmap include any additional explanatory text or captions?'
