initial_prompt: Create a pie chart using the "Sequence Name" column from the Ecoli
  Data Set to show the distribution of different sequences in the dataset. Highlight
  the most frequent sequences and use text annotations to display the specific percentage
  each sequence contributes to the total. This will help in visualizing which sequence
  names are most common in the dataset, providing a clearer understanding of the genomic
  data distribution. Make sure to use different colors to distinguish between each
  sequence and highlight the top 3 sequences in a more prominent color.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used in the pie
  chart?

  2. Is there a specific way you would like the text annotations to be formatted or
  styled?

  3. Would you prefer the top 3 sequences to be highlighted using specific colors
  or patterns?

  4. Is there a particular font or font size you would like for the labels and annotations?

  5. Do you have any preferences on the size or aspect ratio of the pie chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend indicating the sequence names and corresponding
  colors?

  7. Is there any additional text or title you would like to be included on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the ordering of the slices (e.g., clockwise
  starting from the most frequent)?

  9. Would you like to see percentage values, count values, or both for each sequence
  in the text annotations?

  10. Is there a specific background color or style you would like for the chart?'
