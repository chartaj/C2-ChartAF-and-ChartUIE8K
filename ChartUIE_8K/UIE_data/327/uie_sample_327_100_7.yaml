initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for the Ecoli Data Set, focusing on genomics.
  Use the 'mcg,' 'gvh,' 'lip,' 'chg,' 'aac,' 'alm1,' and 'alm2' columns for the y-axes,
  and 'Sequence Name' for the x-axis. Make sure the x-axis represents the sequence
  names like 'AAT_ECOLI', 'ACEA_ECOLI', 'ACEK_ECOLI,' etc. Show all these measurements
  across the different sequences to observe and compare trends in the genomic data.
  Ensure that each line represents one of the feature columns. Kindly use different
  colors for each feature to clearly distinguish them. Thanks!
questions: "1. Do you have any preferences for the title or any specific labels on\
  \ the x-axis and y-axis?\n2. Are there any specific colors you prefer for each of\
  \ the feature columns (mcg, gvh, lip, chg, aac, alm1, alm2)?\n3. Would you like\
  \ to include grid lines in the chart to aid in visualization? If so, horizontal,\
  \ vertical, or both?\n4. Do you want to display data labels for each data point\
  \ on the lines? \n5. Should the legend be placed at a specific position on the chart\
  \ (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?\n6. Are there any specific styling preferences\
  \ for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?\n7. Do you prefer a specific font\
  \ style or size for the labels and title in the chart?\n8. Should the chart include\
  \ any annotations or markers to highlight significant data points or trends?\n9.\
  \ Would you like to include a background color or specific theme for the chart?"
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the title or labels.

  2. I am not sure about specific colors, just use different colors for each feature.

  3. Yes, please include both horizontal and vertical grid lines.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference for the legend position.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for line styles.

  7. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  8. I am not sure if annotations or markers are needed.

  9. I have no specific preference for background color or theme.'
