initial_prompt: I need a histogram chart that shows the distribution of values for
  the 'mcg' column from the Ecoli Data Set. Since this column has missing values,
  please handle them appropriately before creating the chart (e.g., omitting them).
  The goal is to visualize the frequency of 'mcg' values to understand its distribution
  pattern. Make sure the x-axis represents the 'mcg' values, and the y-axis represents
  the frequency count. This will help in identifying any common ranges or patterns
  in 'mcg' for genomic research purposes in the Ecoli data. Thanks!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have a specific number of bins you would like the histogram to have, or
  should it be auto-calculated?

  3. Should the missing values be completely omitted or replaced with a specific value
  before plotting?

  4. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you want axis labels to be a certain font size or style?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, or is it unnecessary since there is only one
  data attribute being visualized?

  8. Do you have any preference for the width or height of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Auto-calculated bins would be fine.

  3. The missing values should be completely omitted.

  4. I do not know.

  5. "Distribution of ''mcg'' Values in Ecoli Data Set"

  6. I do not know.

  7. A legend is unnecessary.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
