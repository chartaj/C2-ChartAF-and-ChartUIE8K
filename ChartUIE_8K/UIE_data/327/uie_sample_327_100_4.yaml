initial_prompt: I'd like to create a stacked bar chart using the Ecoli Data Set, focusing
  on the genomics data provided. The x-axis should display different sequences such
  as 'AAT_ECOLI', 'ACEA_ECOLI', and 'ACEK_ECOLI'. Each bar will be divided into stacked
  sections showing the values for 'mcg', 'gvh', 'lip', 'chg', 'aac', 'alm1', and 'alm2'.
  This chart should help visualize the contribution of each attribute to the overall
  sequence profile. Please ensure that the chart handles any missing data gracefully,
  possibly by ignoring or interpolating the missing values. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color palette would you prefer for the stacked sections representing
  different attributes?

  2. Do you have a preference for the order in which the attributes are stacked in
  the bars?

  3. How would you like to handle missing data: ignoring, interpolating, or another
  method?

  4. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact values within each segment
  of the stacked bars?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned
  on the chart?

  7. Should the visualization display gridlines for easier comparison of values across
  sequences?

  8. Do you have any specific font preferences for the chart text (e.g., font type,
  size, color)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette, you can choose what looks best.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the order of stacking the attributes.

  3. Interpolating missing data would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include data labels showing the exact values.

  5. I do not have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be positioned.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for easier comparison.

  8. I do not have any specific font preferences, you can choose what is most legible.'
