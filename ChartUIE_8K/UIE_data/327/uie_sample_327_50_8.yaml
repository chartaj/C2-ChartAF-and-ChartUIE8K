initial_prompt: '"Please create a histogram showing the distribution of ''mcg'' values
  from the Ecoli Data Set. This should help visualize the frequency of different ''mcg''
  gene expressions."'
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines in the histogram for better readability?

  4. Should the x-axis be labeled with specific intervals or left to be determined

  6. Would you like to include axis labels? If yes, please specify the labels for
  the x-axis and y-axis.

  7. Do you prefer the histogram to display absolute frequencies or relative frequencies
  (percentages)?

  8. Is there any specific legend or annotation you would like to include in the histogram?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the style of the bars (e.g., solid, outlined)?'
