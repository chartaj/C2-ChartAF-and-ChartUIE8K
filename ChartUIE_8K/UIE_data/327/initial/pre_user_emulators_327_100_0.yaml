2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart using the "Sequence Name" column from the Ecoli Data Set to show
  the distribution of different sequences in the dataset. Highlight the most frequent
  sequences and use text annotations to display the specific percentage each sequence
  contributes to the total. This will help in visualizing which sequence names are
  most common in the dataset, providing a clearer understanding of the genomic data
  distribution. Make sure to use different colors to distinguish between each sequence
  and highlight the top 3 sequences in a more prominent color.
