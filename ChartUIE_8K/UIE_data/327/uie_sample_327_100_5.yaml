initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Ecoli Data Set. Plot 'Sequence
  Name' on the x-axis and 'mcg' values on the y-axis. Each point should represent
  an individual sequence, and missing values should be handled appropriately. Make
  sure to label the axes clearly, and provide a title that reflects the relationship
  being observed between the sequences and their 'mcg' values. Additionally, include
  a legend if there are multiple data points with distinct characteristics. Use different
  colors or symbols to differentiate these points if needed.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme used for the
  scatter plot points?

  2. Are there any preferred symbols you would like to use to represent the data points?

  3. How would you like missing ''mcg'' values to be handled or displayed?

  4. Do you have a specific title in mind for the scatter plot?

  5. Are there particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should the legend include any specific categories or descriptions for the data
  points?

  8. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the legend?'
