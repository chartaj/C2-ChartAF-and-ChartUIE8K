initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to campus recruitment, focusing on students'
  educational backgrounds and their placement status. I want to visualize this data
  using a strip plot to see the distribution of salaries across different specializations
  (Mkt&HR, Mkt&Fin) and academic performances. Please create a strip plot that shows
  salary on the y-axis and specialisation on the x-axis, with data points representing
  individual students. Highlight any patterns or trends regarding how specialization
  and academic scores (ssc_p, hsc_p, degree_p, mba_p) influence placement salaries.
  This will help understand the relationship better.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a particular color palette for the strip plot?

  2. Should the strip plot include a legend explaining the color coding?

  3. Would you like to include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  titles in mind?

  4. Do you want to add grid lines to the plot for better readability?

  5. Should the academic scores (ssc_p, hsc_p, degree_p, mba_p) be displayed as annotations
  on the data points or aggregated in any special way?

  6. Do you prefer any specific point shapes or sizes for the data points in the strip
  plot?

  7. Would you like to include lines or markers to indicate average or median salaries
  for each specialization?

  8. Do you want to highlight any specific trends or patterns within the data using
  special markers or colors?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the strip plot should include a legend explaining the color coding.

  3. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. Title: "Distribution of Placement
  Salaries by Specialization", x-axis: "Specialization", y-axis: "Salary (in thousands)".

  4. I do not know.
