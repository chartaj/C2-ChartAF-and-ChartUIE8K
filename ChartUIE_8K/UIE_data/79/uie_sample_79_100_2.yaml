initial_prompt: Create a bar chart displaying the average salaries based on different
  degrees (degree_t) for placed students. Highlight the highest and lowest average
  salaries with different colors. Add text annotations indicating the exact average
  salary values on top of the bars for these highest and lowest points. The purpose
  is to compare salary outcomes across different degrees and provide insight into
  which degrees lead to higher placements. This visualization will be useful for students
  planning their education and careers and institutions aiming to optimize their programs.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different degrees?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest average salaries to be highlighted
  (specific colors or patterns)?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to be in a specific orientation (vertical or horizontal
  bars)?

  4. Is there a particular font and size for the text annotations indicating the exact
  average salary values?

  5. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the X-axis, Y-axis, and the
  chart itself?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart legend, if needed (e.g., at the
  top, bottom, to the side)?

  7. Should the chart follow any specific color schemes or guidelines, such as an
  institutional color palette?

  8. Would you like any additional information or context included in any part of
  the chart for better understanding?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different degrees.

  2. The highest average salary could be highlighted in green, and the lowest in red.

  3. I am not sure, either vertical or horizontal bars would be fine.

  4. I do not know, any readable font and size for the text annotations will work.

  5. The X-axis could be labeled as "Degree Type" and the Y-axis as "Average Salary".
  The chart title could be "Average Salaries by Degree Type for Placed Students".

  6. I am not sure, place the chart legend where it looks best.

  7. No specific color schemes or guidelines need to be followed.

  8. I do not have any additional information or context to include.'
