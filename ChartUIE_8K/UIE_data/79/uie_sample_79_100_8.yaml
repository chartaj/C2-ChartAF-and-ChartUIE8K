initial_prompt: I'd like a Dumbbell chart to visualize the impact of work experience
  on campus recruitment salaries. Use 'workex' on the x-axis with categories 'Yes'
  and 'No'. The y-axis should represent 'salary'. Each pair of dumbbells should represent
  the minimum, average, and maximum salaries for 'Placed' graduates in both work experience
  categories. Label each point with the respective salary amounts. Color code the
  dumbbells for easy distinction between 'Yes' and 'No' categories. Include a legend
  explaining the colors. This will help us understand salary variations due to work
  experience better.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to distinguish
  ''Yes'' and ''No'' categories for work experience?

  2. Would you like specific shapes or symbols for the data points representing minimum,
  average, and maximum salaries?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the font size or style for the labels
  on each salary point?

  4. Is there a preferred order for the placement of minimum, average, and maximum
  salary points within each dumbbell?

  5. Do you have any specific dimensions or aspect ratio in mind for the chart?

  6. Would you prefer the chart to have a grid background, or should it be plain?

  7. Do you need any additional annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key
  insights?

  8. Do you have preferences for the position or styling of the legend explaining
  the colors?'

  3. I do not know.

  4. Minimum on the left, average in the middle, and maximum on the right.

  5. I am not sure.
