  create a line chart visualizing the relationship between educational percentages
  (ssc_p, hsc_p, degree_p, etest_p, mba_p) and salaries. This should help in understanding
  how different educational performance metrics correlate with placement salaries.
  Make sure to plot the five educational percentage columns on the x-axis, and the
