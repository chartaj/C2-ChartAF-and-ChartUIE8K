initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing student placement status ('Placed' or 'Not
  Placed') across various education factors (SSC percentage, HSC percentage, Degree
  percentage, and MBA percentage). Highlight the correlation between these education
  percentages and their placement status, emphasizing missing salary data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like to handle missing salary data visually? For example, should
  it be indicated with a specific color or pattern?

  3. Should the heatmap include annotations (numeric values) on each cell?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color scales and what they
  represent?

  5. Do you have a preference for the title and axis labels of the heatmap?

  6. Is there a particular arrangement of the education factors that you prefer (e.g.,
  SSC percentage first, then HSC, etc.)?

  7. Should the heatmap display a gradient color scale for better visualization of
  correlations?

  8. Do you want to add any descriptive statistics or summary information alongside
  the heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer the heatmap to be clustered or ordered in any specific way?'
