09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different degrees.

  2. The highest average salary could be highlighted in green, and the lowest in red.

  3. I am not sure, either vertical or horizontal bars would be fine.

  4. I do not know, any readable font and size for the text annotations will work.

  5. The X-axis could be labeled as "Degree Type" and the Y-axis as "Average Salary".
  The chart title could be "Average Salaries by Degree Type for Placed Students".

  6. I am not sure, place the chart legend where it looks best.

  7. No specific color schemes or guidelines need to be followed.

  8. I do not have any additional information or context to include.'
