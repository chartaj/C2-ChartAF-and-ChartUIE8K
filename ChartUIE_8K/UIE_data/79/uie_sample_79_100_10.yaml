initial_prompt: I need a box chart for a presentation on campus recruitment data.
  The focus is on education details and salary distribution among students. The chart
  should show the spread of SSC percentage, HSC percentage, degree percentage, and
  MBA percentage, and compare that to salary distribution. It should also visually
  differentiate between those with work experience and those without. Please ensure
  it is easy to interpret, as Iâ€™ll be presenting to non-technical stakeholders. Use
  the sample data to create this visualization, highlighting key trends and anomalies
  in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating students with
  and without work experience?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the chart to show specific values?

  3. Is there a particular order in which you want the educational percentages to
  be displayed?

  4. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the box chart?

  5. Would you like to include any reference lines or annotations to highlight key
  trends and anomalies?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the axis scales (e.g., percentage
  format, specific range)?'

  2. Yes, please include data labels to show specific values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Vertical orientation would be preferred.

  anomalies.

  6. I have no specific preference.
