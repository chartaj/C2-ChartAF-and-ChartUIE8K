initial_prompt: I have a dataset called "Campus Recruitment" related to education.
  From this data, I would like to create a treemap chart. The key focus should be
  on representing the various specializations of the students (Mkt&HR, Mkt&Fin) and
  their placement status (Placed, Not Placed) along with their gender distribution
  (M/F). Ensure to include the average salary information for each category, if available.
  Each rectangular section of the treemap should indicate the number of students in
  each specialization and their placement status. Please make the chart colorful and
  easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred color schemes or palettes for the treemap chart?

  2. Should gender distribution be displayed using specific colors or patterns within
  each category?

  3. Do you have a preference for the level of detail or granularity for salary information
  in the treemap?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included in each section
  of the treemap?

  5. Are there any specializations or statuses that you''d like to be highlighted
  more prominently?

  6. How would you like the data to be sorted within the treemap (e.g., by number
  of students, by average salary)?'
