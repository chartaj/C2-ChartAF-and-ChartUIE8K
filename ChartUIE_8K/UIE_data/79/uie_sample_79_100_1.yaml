initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  students' MBA percentage (mba_p) and their salaries (salary) post-campus recruitment.
  Highlight different specialisations (specialisation) with unique colors and add
  text annotations for data points where students are "Placed." This will help identify
  trends in salaries based on MBA performance and specializations. Please ensure missing
  salary data is handled appropriately and doesn't affect the plot. The focus is on
  understanding how MBA scores and specializations influence placement outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to highlight
  different specializations?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style or font for the text annotations?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to identify the colors representing different
  specializations?

  4. Do you have a preference for how the missing salary data should be depicted or
  handled on the scatter plot?

  5. Would you like to include axis labels and titles on the chart? If so, do you
  have any specific text in mind?

  6. Is there a particular axis scale (linear or logarithmic) you prefer for the MBA
  percentages and salaries?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability? If
  so, do you have a preference for their style or color?

  8. Do you want to set specific limits or ranges for the x-axis (MBA percentage)
  or y-axis (salary)?

  9. Are there any additional elements or details you would like to see in the scatter
  plot (e.g., data point markers, trend lines, etc.)?

  10. Do you have a specific title in mind for the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to identify the colors representing different specializations.

  4. I do not have a specific preference, but please ensure missing salary data doesn''t
  affect the plot.

  5. Yes, please include axis labels and titles. For the x-axis: "MBA Percentage,"
  and for the y-axis: "Salary (in currency units)." The chart title can be "Relationship
  between MBA Percentage and Salary by Specialization."

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful. I do not have a preference for their
  style or color.

  8. I do not have specific limits or ranges in mind.

  9. Including data point markers and trend lines would be beneficial.

  10. The title can be "Relationship between MBA Percentage and Salary by Specialization."'
