initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between num_reactions
  and num_comments across different status types (video, photo, etc.). Highlight extreme
  values using color and annotate key data points to draw attention to significant
  engagement levels. This will help visualize social media engagement.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting extreme
  values?

  2. Would you prefer distinct markers or shapes to represent different status types
  (video, photo, status, link)?

  3. Do you have a preferred size for the annotations on key data points?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or ranges?

  5. Is there a particular background style (e.g., grid lines, solid color) that you
  prefer for the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like a legend to differentiate status types? If yes, do you have a
  preferred position for the legend on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds for values to consider them as ''extreme''?

  8. Do you want any trend lines or regression lines to be added to the scatter plot
  to emphasize the correlation?

  9. What font style and size would you like to use for the annotations and axis labels?

  10. Should the title and axis labels include any specific text or formatting?'
