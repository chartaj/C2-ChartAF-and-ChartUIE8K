initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the social media engagement data from
  the CSV file. The chart should display the trends over time for various metrics,
  including the number of reactions, comments, shares, likes, loves, wows, hahas,
  sads, and angrys. Additionally, differentiate the status types (link, photo, status,
  video) using a legend or different lines. This will help understand how different
  types of posts perform in terms of user engagement. Use the sample data provided
  for this visualization. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret. Thanks!
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different\
  \ status types?\n2. How do you prefer the time axis to be formatted (e.g., daily,\
  \ weekly, monthly)?\n3. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?\n\
  4. Should the chart include data labels for each data point, or only at significant\
  \ intervals?\n5. Do you prefer a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for\
  \ different metrics?\n6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the\
  \ axes labels and title?\n7. Would you like to see a legend, and if so, where should\
  \ it be placed (e.g., top, bottom, side)?\n8. Should there be any annotations or\
  \ markers for key events/dates on the chart? \n9. Do you have a preference for the\
  \ overall aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?\n10. Is displaying aggregate\
  \ values (like sums or averages) at the end of each line important for your analysis?"
