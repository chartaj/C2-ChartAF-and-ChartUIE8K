initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize Near-Earth Comets data. The x-axis
  should be 'Object_name' and the y-axis should be 'e' (eccentricity). Include data
  from 264.csv and represent missing values with a distinct color.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be represented? Is there a specific

  of the distinct color for missing values?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text elements
  (e.g., axis labels, title, legend)?

  8. Would you like the bars to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., ascending
  or descending by eccentricity)?

  9. Should any additional annotations or data labels be included on the bars themselves
  for more detailed information?'
