initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing Near-Earth Comets data with annotations
  focusing on 'q', 'P', and 'MOID'. Highlight significant comets for comparison. Include
  text annotations to emphasize important values and context. Utilize size and color
  to distinguish key elements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles?

  2. How would you like the sizes of the bubbles to be scaled (e.g., linearly, logarithmically)?

  3. Are there any specific comets you consider significant that must be highlighted?

  4. Do you have a preferred format for the text annotations?

  5. How many different color categories would you prefer to distinguish key elements?

  6. Would you like a legend to explain the bubble sizes and colors?

  7. Is there a specific color you would like for the background of the chart?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations and labels?

  9. Is there a particular layout for the annotations you would like to see?

  10. Do you have any preference for the chart title and labels for the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Halley''s Comet and Comet Hale-Bopp should be highlighted.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. The title could be "Comparison of Significant Near-Earth Comets" and labels
  for the axes can be ''Perihelion Distance (q)'', ''Orbital Period (P)'', and ''Minimum
  Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID)''.'
