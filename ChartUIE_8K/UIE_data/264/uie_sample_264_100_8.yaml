initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the unique values count for each column
  from the dataset "../Extra_datas/data/264.csv". The dataset includes details about
  Near-Earth Comets. For each column (like 'Object', 'Epoch', 'TP', etc.), the bar
  chart should display the number of unique values. Ensure the columns are listed
  on the x-axis and the count of unique values on the y-axis. The chart should highlight
  the column's information contextually connected to space and astronomy, making it
  visually appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme or theme related to
  space and astronomy for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like labels or annotations on each bar to display the count of unique
  values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  4. Should the bars be sorted in any specific order (e.g., ascending or descending
  by the count of unique values)?

  5. Would you like a title for the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines or background of the chart?

  7. Are there any particular columns that you would like to highlight or distinguish
  from the others on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer any specific width or orientation for the bars (e.g., horizontal
  bar chart instead of vertical)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend or any additional text information on the
  chart?

  10. Should specific axis ranges or limits be set for the y-axis to enhance clarity?'
