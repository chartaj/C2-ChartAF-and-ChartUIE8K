initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the distribution of near-Earth
  comets. Use the 'i' (inclination) values to color-code regions. Ensure the map shows
  each comet's orbital properties, such as 'w' (argument of perihelion) and 'Node'
  (longitude of ascending node).
questions: '1. Do you have a specific geographical region focus for the choropleth
  map, or should it be global?

  2. Is there a preference for the color scheme used to represent the ''i'' (inclination)
  values?

  3. Would you like to include a legend that explains the color coding for the inclination
  values?

  4. Do you want the size or shape of markers to represent any additional data attributes,
  such as ''w'' or ''Node''?

  5. Should the map include labels or markers for each comet to display its name,
  or just the color-coding is sufficient?

  6. Do you have any preference for the map''s projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  7. Are there specific ranges or thresholds for the inclination values that you would
  like highlighted or categorized differently?

  8. Would you like to see any additional orbital properties or details in tooltips
  when hovering over regions or markers?'
