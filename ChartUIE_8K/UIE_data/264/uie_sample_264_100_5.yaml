initial_prompt: I have data on near-Earth comets with various parameters like Epoch,
  TP, e, i, w, Node, q, Q, P, MOID, A1, A2, A3, DT, and object names. Can you create
  a box chart to visualize the distributions of "e", "i", "w", "Node", "q", "Q", "P",
  and "MOID"? I want to see the spread and identify any potential outliers for these
  orbital elements and parameters for the different comets in my dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include labels for outliers?

  3. Would you like to add titles and axis labels to the chart?

  4. How would you prefer to deal with missing values, if there are any?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box plots (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should the chart include legends to distinguish different comet parameters?

  7. Do you want any specific statistical information to be displayed on the chart,
  such as median or quartiles?

  8. Should the chart highlight any specific comets or groups of comets?

  9. How detailed should the axis ticks and grid lines be on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the chart should include labels for outliers.

  3. Yes, please add titles and axis labels to the chart.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Vertical orientation is preferred.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, display the median and quartiles.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Detailed enough to clearly distinguish the data points.'
