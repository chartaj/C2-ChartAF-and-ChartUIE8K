initial_prompt: I want to see a donut chart that shows the GDP composition by sector
  (Agriculture, Industry, Services) for the top 3 countries (United States, China,
  Japan) from the dataset. Each segment should represent the sector's contribution
  to the country's total GDP. The chart should have three rings, one for each country.
  The inner ring should display Agriculture, the middle ring Industry, and the outer
  ring Services. Please label each segment with the sector's percentage contribution
  to the GDP for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of each sector (Agriculture,
  Industry, Services)?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to each
  sector?

  3. Would you like the country names to be displayed outside each ring or within
  the chart title?

  4. Do you prefer specific fonts or sizes for the labels and titles on the chart?

  5. Should the percentage labels inside each segment also include the name of the
  sector, or just the percentage?

  6. Do you want any additional information to be displayed when hovering over the
  segments?

  7. Would you like the chart to include any other annotations or highlights?'
