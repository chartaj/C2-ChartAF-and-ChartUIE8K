initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the GDP sector composition (Agriculture,
  Industry, Services) for the United States, China, and Japan in 2017. Highlight notable
  differences in the percentage contributions of each sector to their respective GDPs
  to emphasize their economic structure. Include text annotations showing the exact
  percentage values for clarity. This visualization will help in understanding the
  economic balance within these major economies. Additionally, use different colors
  for each sector to distinctly separate them, making it easier to compare across
  the countries. Each bar group should represent a country, with three bars for the
  sectors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different GDP sectors
  (Agriculture, Industry, Services)?

  2. Do you have any preference for the font type or size for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like the bars to have specific patterns or textures for better differentiation?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines for easier comparison, or would you
  like a cleaner look without them?

  5. Should the chart have a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific wording
  in mind?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style or formatting for the percentage values displayed
  within the chart (e.g., bold, italic)?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines or standards (e.g., corporate branding guidelines)
  that the chart needs to adhere to?'

  5. Yes, the chart should have a title and axis labels. The title could be "GDP Sector
  Composition by Country (2017)", and the axis labels can be "Countries" for the x-axis
  and "Percentage of GDP" for the y-axis.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. I do not have a preference for its position.
