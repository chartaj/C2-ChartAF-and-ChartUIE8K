initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot illustrating countries' GDP compositions with
  sectors (Agriculture, Industry, Services) on axes. Use data-driven text annotations
  to display GDP values and highlight key countries like the US and China. This will
  visually compare sector contributions by country.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the sectors
  (Agriculture, Industry, Services)?

  2. How would you prefer to highlight key countries like the US and China (e.g.,
  larger markers, different colors, bold text)?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color/marker scheme used for
  different sectors and countries?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations displaying
  GDP values?

  5. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability of data points?

  6. Are there specific axis labels or titles you would like to use for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include a brief title or caption for the entire scatter plot?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scaling of the axes (e.g., logarithmic or linear
  scale)?

  9. Should the scatter plot include data points for all countries, or only those
  with the largest GDP contributions?

  10. Would you like to annotate additional information such as GDP percentages or
  ranks in the scatter plot?'
