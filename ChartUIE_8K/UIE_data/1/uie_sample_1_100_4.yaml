initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that shows the top 10 countries by GDP in millions
  of dollars. The x-axis should display the country names and the y-axis should show
  the GDP in millions. Each bar should represent a different country. Also, include
  different colored segments for each bar to indicate the percentage contributions
  from Agriculture, Industry, and Services sectors. The data is from 2017, so make
  sure to title the chart accordingly. If possible, provide a legend to clarify which
  colors correspond to which sector. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for the
  segments representing Agriculture, Industry, and Services sectors?

  2. Would you like any specific font style or size for the country names and GDP
  values on the axes?

  3. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability of the values?

  4. Should the chart include data labels displaying the exact GDP values on each
  bar?

  5. Is there a specific orientation you prefer for the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal
  or angled)?

  6. Do you have any specific layout or positioning preference for the legend on the
  chart?

  7. Would you like the chart to include annotations or additional information such
  as average GDP or total GDP for the top 10 countries?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  3. I do not know about the grid lines, whatever you think is best.

  4. Yes, the chart should include data labels displaying the exact GDP values on
  each bar.

  5. I prefer the x-axis labels to be horizontal.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the legend layout or positioning.

  7. I do not need additional annotations or information beyond what I requested.'
