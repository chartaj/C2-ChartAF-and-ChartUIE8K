initial_prompt: I want a stacked area chart that breaks down GDP composition by sector
  for different countries. Use the "Agriculture GDP," "IndustryGDP," and "ServicesGDP"
  columns for the sectors, and differentiate these sectors with unique colors for
  each. Also, include data for the top 10 countries by GDP, which you can find in
  the "Rank" column. Make sure the x-axis represents the countries in order of their
  rank, and the y-axis shows the GDP numbers. This will help visualize each country's
  economic structure in terms of sector contribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  sectors?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer specific font styles and sizes for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to identify the sectors?

  5. Would you like to display data labels on the chart to show exact values?

  6. Are there any specific countries that must be highlighted?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to be displayed in a particular aspect ratio?'
