initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the GDP sector composition for different
  countries in 2017. Use 'Country/Economy' along the y-axis and sectors 'Agriculture
  GDP', 'IndustryGDP', and 'ServicesGDP' along the x-axis. The cell values should
  represent the respective GDP figures in millions of dollars. Highlight varying GDP
  contributions by different color intensities for a clear comparison of sectoral
  contributions across the countries. Use the "Rank" to sort countries on the y-axis
  for better readability. Ensure the heatmap visually differentiates the high and
  low GDP values effectively. Keep the labels and color scale for clear interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or color
  gradient to be used in the heatmap?

  2. What should be the range or scale for the color intensities to represent the
  varying GDP values effectively?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and axis titles?

  4. How would you like the GDP figures (cell values) to be formatted (e.g., with
  commas, in millions, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any requirements for the sorting order of the countries aside from
  using the "Rank"?

  6. Are there any specific countries or sectors that you want to be highlighted or
  emphasized?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the heatmap to provide
  further insights?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific preferences for the color scheme or
  color gradient.

  2. I do not know about the range or scale for the color intensities.

  3. I have no specific preference for the font style or size for the labels and axis
  titles.

  4. The GDP figures should be formatted in millions of dollars with commas.

  5. No, just using the "Rank" to sort the countries is fine.

  6. I do not have any specific countries or sectors that I want to be highlighted
  or emphasized.

  7. I am not sure about additional annotations or markers.

  8. I have no specific preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the heatmap.'
