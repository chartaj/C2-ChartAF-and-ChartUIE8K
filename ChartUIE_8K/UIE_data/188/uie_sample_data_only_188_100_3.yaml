02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset of the top 1000 YouTube channels, including their
  rank, subscribers, video views, video count, category, and start year. Could you
  create a pie chart showing the distribution of YouTube channels by category? This
  will help visualize which categories are most represented among the top channels.
  Please ensure the pie chart highlights the percentage share of each category. It
  would be great if you could label each segment with the category name and its percentage.
  Thank you!

  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
