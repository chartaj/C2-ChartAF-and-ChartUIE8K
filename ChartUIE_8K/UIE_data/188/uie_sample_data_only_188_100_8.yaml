09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about using specific shapes. Let''s stick with colors for now.

  3. I am not sure. Maybe alongside the chart is fine.

  4. I do not know. Use a size range that makes the differences clear but not overwhelming.

  5. I prefer linear scaling for both axes.

  6. I would like to highlight the categories ''Entertainment'', ''Music'', and ''Gaming''
  more distinctly.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for reference lines or markers.

  8. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  9. I am not sure. No additional information needed at the moment.

  10. I do not need tooltips or labels for this static image.'
