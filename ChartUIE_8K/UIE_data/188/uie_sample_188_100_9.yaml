initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the top 1000 YouTube channels.
  The x-axis should represent the Youtubers, and the y-axis should display the number
  of Subscribers. Each column should be divided by Category. The colors in the stacks
  should represent different Categories like Entertainment, Music, Film & Animation,
  etc. Ensure to make the chart interactive, allowing us to see detailed numbers when
  hovering over the stacks. Use this to compare the popularity of different Categories
  across the top channels. Include data labels for Subscribers to make the chart more
  informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different Categories?

  2. How would you like the Youtubers to be sorted on the x-axis (e.g., by the number
  of Subscribers, alphabetically)?

  3. Would you prefer to have gridlines on the chart for better readability, or should
  they be minimal?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the data labels and axis
  labels?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing each Category?

  6. Do you want to display the exact number of Subscribers on the chart, or would
  rounded numbers (e.g., in millions) be sufficient?

  7. How much spacing would you prefer between the columns on the x-axis?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or notes to highlight significant points
  or trends?

  9. Would you like to set a specific range for the y-axis, or should it be adjusted
  based on the data?

  10. Is there a preferred background color or theme (e.g., light, dark) for the chart?'
