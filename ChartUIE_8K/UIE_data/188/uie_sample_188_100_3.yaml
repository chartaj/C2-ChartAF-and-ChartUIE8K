initial_prompt: I have a dataset of the top 1000 YouTube channels, including their
  rank, subscribers, video views, video count, category, and start year. Could you
  create a pie chart showing the distribution of YouTube channels by category? This
  will help visualize which categories are most represented among the top channels.
  Please ensure the pie chart highlights the percentage share of each category. It
  would be great if you could label each segment with the category name and its percentage.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart segments?

  2. Should we include a legend alongside the chart or incorporate labels directly
  within the segments only?

  3. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would like to use for the category
  names and percentages?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and its formatting?

  5. Would you like the chart to include data labels outside the pie chart segments,
  or should they be inside the segments?

  6. Do you want the segments to be separated (exploded) for emphasis on certain categories?

  7. Is there a certain order you would prefer the categories to be displayed in (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by size)?

  8. Should we include a description or annotation to highlight any particular finding
  within the chart?

  9. Do you have any margin or padding preferences for the chart layout?'
