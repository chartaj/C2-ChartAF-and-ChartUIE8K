initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the top-ranked YouTube channels by
  subscribers. Highlight the top 3 channels and annotate them with details like subscriber
  count and category. The chart aims to showcase the prominence of leading channels
  in different categories. Ensure annotations emphasize significant data points and
  provide context for the viewer. The x-axis should represent Youtubers and the y-axis
  should indicate the number of subscribers. Highlight and provide focused annotations
  on categories to emphasize the diversity of popular content on YouTube.

  5. Should the annotations be placed above the bars, inside the bars, or to the side?

  6. Do you want the chart to include a legend to differentiate the categories?

  7. How many channels (besides the top 3) would you like to include in the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the format of the y-axis labels (e.g., in millions,
