initial_prompt: I want to visualize a line chart that shows the trend of the top 3
  YouTube channels' video views over the years. Each line should represent a different
  YouTube channel (MrBeast, T-Series, and YouTube Movies). Use the 'Started' year
  as the X-axis and 'Video Views' as the Y-axis. Make sure to highlight the significant
  milestones for each channel. Provide a legend to distinguish between the channels.
  Can you ensure the chart is easy to understand with clear labels and titles? Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing each
  YouTube channel?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Should the significant milestones be highlighted with markers or annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of the lines (solid, dashed, dotted)?

  5. What style of labels would you prefer for the axes? (e.g., font type, size, color)

  6. Is there a specific format you would like for the chart title and legend?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a subtitle for additional context?

  8. Should the Y-axis be displayed with a logarithmic scale to accommodate large
  numbers?

  9. Are there any specific milestones or events you want to be highlighted for each
  channel?

  10. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  side)?'
