initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the "Top 1000 YouTube Channels in
  the World üåêüìäüé•". Plot the "Subscribers" on the x-axis and "Video Views" on the y-axis.
  Use different colors to represent the "Category" of each YouTube channel. Additionally,
  size the scatter points based on the "Video Count" to show how prolific each channel
  is. Please ensure to title the chart and label the axes properly for clear understanding.
  Show top categories distinctly, maybe with a legend.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for distinguishing\
  \ the \"Category\" of YouTube channels?\n2. Would you like to use specific shapes\
  \ for scatter points to represent different categories in addition to colors?\n\
  3. How would you like the legend to be displayed (e.g., alongside the chart, below\
  \ the chart, or in a separate section)?\n4. Is there a specific size range you would\
  \ prefer for the scatter points based on the \"Video Count\"?\n5. Do you have any\
  \ preferences for the scaling of the axes (e.g., linear vs. logarithmic)?\n6. Are\
  \ there any particular categories you would like to highlight or show more distinctly\
  \ in the chart?\n7. Would you like to add any reference lines or markers for specific\
  \ values on the axes? \n8. Do you have any specific font preferences for the title,\
  \ axis labels, and legend? \n9. Are there any annotations or additional information\
  \ you would like to include on the chart?\n10. Would you like to include tooltips\
  \ or labels that display the channel name and data values when hovering over the\
  \ scatter points?"
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about using specific shapes. Let''s stick with colors for now.

  3. I am not sure. Maybe alongside the chart is fine.

  4. I do not know. Use a size range that makes the differences clear but not overwhelming.

  5. I prefer linear scaling for both axes.

  6. I would like to highlight the categories ''Entertainment'', ''Music'', and ''Gaming''
  more distinctly.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for reference lines or markers.

  8. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  9. I am not sure. No additional information needed at the moment.
