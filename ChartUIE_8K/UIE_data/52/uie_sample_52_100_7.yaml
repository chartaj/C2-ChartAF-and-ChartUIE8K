initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the trend of computer prices
  over time. Use the 'price' column for the Y-axis and the 'trend' column for the
  X-axis. I want to see how the prices have changed according to the trend. Also,
  include a few lines to represent the change in 'speed' and 'ram' over the same 'trend'
  period for comparison. Make sure the chart is clear and well-labeled. Thank you!

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability? If so, do you have
  a preference for gridline style or color?

  lines?
