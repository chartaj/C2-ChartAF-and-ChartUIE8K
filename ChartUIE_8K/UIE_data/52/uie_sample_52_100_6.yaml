initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize the computer data from
  the dataset. Specifically, I want to compare the "premium" versus "non-premium"
  computers across multiple factors such as "price", "speed", "hd", "ram", and "screen".
  Each column should represent one of these factors, and the stacks within each column
  should differentiate between premium and non-premium computers. Use contrasting
  colors like blue and orange for clarity. Make sure to include proper labels, legends,
  and a title so the chart is easy to understand. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  2. Do you have preferred labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you want to include value labels within each stack?

  4. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and title?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any data sorting order for the factors (alphabetical, ascending,
  descending)?

  8. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size for the chart that you would prefer?'
