initial_prompt: Create a box chart using the computer data to compare the price distribution
  based on the screen size. Highlight the boxes with unique colors for each screen
  size to make the differences stand out visually. Add annotations displaying the
  median prices for each screen size category to draw attention to central values,
  helping to focus the viewer's attention. This visualization will help identify pricing
  trends and compare price ranges across different screen sizes. The context is for
  computers and technology, aiming to assist potential buyers or market analysts in
  making data-driven decisions.
