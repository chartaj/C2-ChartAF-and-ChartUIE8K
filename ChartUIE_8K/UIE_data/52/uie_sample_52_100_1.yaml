initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of computer prices
  from the summary data. Highlight key price ranges to emphasize affordability and
  premium segments. Annotate the mean and median prices on the chart to provide context.
  Use distinct colors to separate ranges and include text annotations for specific
  data points, such as the most common price range. This will help in understanding
  the overall pricing trends and identifying patterns in computer pricing. The focus
  should be on providing a clear, visual representation of how computer prices are
  distributed, especially for those on a budget versus those seeking premium options.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How would you like the key price ranges (affordability and premium segments)
  to be labeled?

  3. Do you have specific colors in mind for separating the price ranges?

  4. Are there any specific data points you want to highlight with text annotations
  besides the most common price range, mean, and median?

  5. What level of bin granularity do you prefer for the histogram (e.g., price range
  increments)?

  6. Should the price axis be displayed in any specific intervals?

  7. Do you want any additional statistical information to be included on the chart
  such as standard deviation or quartiles?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. No, just the most common price range, mean, and median.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No, just the mean and median.'
