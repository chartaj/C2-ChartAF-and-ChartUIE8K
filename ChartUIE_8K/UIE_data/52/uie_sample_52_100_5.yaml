initial_prompt: I have a data set about basic computer specifications. I would like
  a scatter plot visualizing this data. Please plot 'price' on the y-axis and 'speed'
  on the x-axis. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between computers
  with and without a CD drive ('cd' column). Also, please include a legend to indicate
  the distinction. I want to see how price correlates with speed and if having a CD
  drive makes any visible difference. Provide a title like "Price vs. Speed of Computers
  with CD Drive Distinction". Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the use of colors or specific markers
  to distinguish between computers with and without a CD drive?

  2. Do you want any specific font type or style for the title and legend?

  3. What size of markers do you prefer on the scatter plot?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be visible on the plot? If yes, in both X and Y axes
  or any one specifically?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  6. Is there a specific range you want to set for the y-axis (''price'') or x-axis
  (''speed''), or should they be automatically determined based on the data?

  7. Would you like to include any specific annotations or highlights in the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the entire chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, gridlines in both X and Y axes would be good.

  5. I am not sure, maybe top-right.

  6. Automatically determined based on the data.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No specific preference.'
