initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to predict heart disease using logistic regression.
  Plot the "age" on the x-axis and "totChol" (total cholesterol) on the y-axis. Differentiate
  male and female participants using different colors (e.g., blue for males and red
  for females). Add markers for the presence of CHD (TenYearCHD); use circles for
  those without CHD and triangles for those with CHD. This will help visualize the
  correlation between age, cholesterol levels, and the presence of heart disease,
  with a distinction by gender. Title it "Age vs. Total Cholesterol and Ten-Year CHD
  Prediction".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between male
  and female participants besides blue and red?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the scatter plot for better readability?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the titles and labels?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to explain the markers and colors used in the
  plot?

  5. Should the range of the axes be automatically derived from the data, or do you
  have specific ranges in mind for the x-axis (age) and y-axis (total cholesterol)?

  6. Would you like to include trend lines or logistic regression lines on the scatter
  plot?

  7. Do you prefer any specific marker size for the circles and triangles indicating
  the presence of CHD?

  8. Is there any specific software or tool where you plan to create or view this
  scatter plot (e.g., Python''s Matplotlib, Tableau, etc.)?'
