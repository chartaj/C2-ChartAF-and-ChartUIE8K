initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of 'sysBP' and 'totChol'
  for males and females. This will help us understand variations and outliers in systolic
  blood pressure and total cholesterol, which are critical factors in predicting heart
  disease.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Would you like the box plots for males and females to be displayed side by side
  or on separate plots?

  3. Should the y-axis for both ''sysBP'' and ''totChol'' be on a common scale, or
  separate scales for each?

  4. Do you have any specific labels or titles you would like to use for the axes
  and the plot overall?

  5. Would you like to include a grid, and if so, should it be on both the x-axis
  and y-axis, or just one of them?

  6. Are there any specific data points you would like to highlight or annotate within
  the box plots?

  7. Do you have a preference for the style of the whiskers in the box plot, such
  as extending to the minimum and maximum values or to a specific percentile range?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the males and females
  within the box plots?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text in the plot?

  10. Would you like to see the mean value indicated within the box plots in addition
  to the median?'
