initial_prompt: Visualize a histogram showing the distribution of 'age' in the dataset
  as this will help us understand the age demographics in predicting heart disease.
  Use text annotations to highlight median and mean ages, emphasizing any significant
  findings. Additionally, use highlights to distinguish age groups with a higher prevalence
  of 'TenYearCHD.' This will help focus on the risk distribution among different age
  groups, essential for healthcare analytics. Also, consider highlighting any trends
  or patterns in 'education' and 'cigsPerDay' to understand their influence on heart
  disease risk.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different age
  groups and significant findings?

  2. Should the median and mean ages be highlighted with specific colors or shapes
  for differentiation?

  3. How would you like the age groups with higher prevalence of ''TenYearCHD'' to
  be visually distinguished (e.g., color, pattern)?

  4. What specific text annotations would you prefer for the highlighted median and
  mean ages?

  5. Are there any specific trends or patterns in ''education'' and ''cigsPerDay''
  that you want to emphasize or visualize a certain way?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the histogram?

  7. Would you like to include any legends or labels to help the audience understand
  the visual elements better?

  8. Should the histogram include grid lines for easier reading of values, or do you
  prefer a cleaner look without them?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the font style and size used in annotations
  and labels?

  10. Are there any particular highlights or markings that should be included to aid
  the visual interpretation for healthcare professionals?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use specific colors or shapes for differentiation.

  3. Color would be good for visually distinguishing age groups with higher prevalence
  of ''TenYearCHD''.

  4. Please highlight the median and mean ages with text annotations mentioning their
  respective values.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, including legends or labels would be helpful.

  8. I prefer a cleaner look without grid lines.

  9. I have no specific preference for font style and size.

  10. Highlights or markings that help healthcare professionals easily interpret significant
  findings would be appreciated.'
