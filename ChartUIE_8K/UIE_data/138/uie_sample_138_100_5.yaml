initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the relationship between age
  and systolic blood pressure (sysBP) in predicting heart disease over ten years.
  The x-axis should represent age, while the y-axis should show systolic blood pressure.
  Separate lines should show data for males and females. Missing values should be
  handled appropriately and a legend to distinguish between gender. Include titles
  and labels to make the chart informative. This visualization should help in understanding
  how age and blood pressure contribute to heart disease risk in both genders.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the lines representing
  males and females?

  2. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific instructions on how you would like the missing values
  to be handled?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the titles and labels?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or additional information on the chart
  for key data points?'
