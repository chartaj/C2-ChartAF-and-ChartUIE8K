initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the market cap distribution across different
  sectors and industries for high-tech companies on NASDAQ. Emphasize companies like
  Apple, Microsoft, and Google using data-driven text annotations that display their
  market cap, price, and beta values. Use highlights to distinguish these key companies
  in the Technology sector. This visualization should aid in quickly identifying major
  players and their relative sizes, offering insights into the concentration of market
  value within the high-tech sector. Include additional context through non-data-driven
  annotations regarding sector and industry classifications.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the heatmap to distinguish
  sectors and industries?

  2. How would you like the highlighted companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google) to be
  visually distinguished from other companies?

  3. Do you have specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations displaying
  market cap, price, and beta values?

  4. Should the heatmap include gridlines to separate different sectors and industries,
  or would you prefer a more continuous gradient?

  5. Would you like the additional context regarding sector and industry classifications
  to be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., on the side, top, or bottom)?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the colors used in the heatmap, and
  if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for numerical values (e.g., commas
  for thousands, or specific decimal places)?

  8. Should the heatmap display values directly on the chart cells, or would you prefer
  a tooltip to show values on hover?

  9. Do you have a preferred chart title and axis labels?'
