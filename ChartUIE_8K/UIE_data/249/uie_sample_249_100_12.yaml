initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize the price trends of high-tech companies
  on NASDAQ over time. Plot the 'symbol' on the x-axis and 'price' on the y-axis.
  Highlight changes in price using different colors for each company. Annotate key
  price changes and percentages for better understanding. The chart should include
  areas indicating market caps and share volumes, overlaying them to show relationships.
  Ensure clear labels for sections and a legend for symbols, with a specific focus
  on Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc. This will help visualize the performance
  and significance of top tech companies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different companies?

  2. Are there specific time intervals you want to highlight on the x-axis (daily,
  weekly, monthly, etc.)?

  3. Do you have preferences for the style or position of annotations for key price
  changes?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. How detailed should the legend be (full company names, tickers, or both)?

  6. Are there any specific threshold values for price changes and percentages that
  should be highlighted differently?

  7. Do you have a preferred method for overlaying market caps and share volumes (separate
  areas, combined, etc.)?

  8. Are there any particular fonts or sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  9. Should the chart include tooltips or labels for each data point, or only for
  key changes?

  10. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?'
