initial_prompt: Let's create a stacked bar chart visualizing the High-Tech Companies
  on NASDAQ. Each bar will represent a company (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) and be divided into
  segments showing pricing changes and earnings per share. Use text annotations to
  highlight market cap, pricing percentage changes, and annualized dividend payout.
  This configuration emphasizes key financial metrics and growth, drawing attention
  to important data elements within each bar for better comparison and understanding.
  Highlight sectors and industries using different colors for contextual clarity.
  Add editorial comments as needed to explain the significance of these metrics.

  industries?

  2. Would you like to include specific labels or annotations for each bar segment?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for text annotations
  and labels?

  4. How should we position the editorial comments within the chart?

  more clarity on the sectors and industries?'
