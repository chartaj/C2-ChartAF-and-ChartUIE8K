initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the prices of high-tech companies
  on NASDAQ over time. Please use Apple Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Alphabet
  Inc. as examples. For each company, plot the price on the y-axis against time on
  the x-axis. The chart should also show pricing changes and percentage changes as
  additional lines or markers. This will help in analyzing the pricing trends and
  volatility of these top tech companies in relation to each other. Ensure that the
  data points are clearly distinguishable with legends for each company. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for each company
  in the line chart?

  2. Do you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for the price, pricing
  changes, and percentage changes?

  3. How would you like the markers for data points to be styled (shape, size, color)
  for each company?

  4. Would you like the x-axis to represent a specific time interval (days, weeks,
  months, years)?

  5. Do you require gridlines for better readability, and if so, at what interval?

  6. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the legends and labels?

  7. Do you want to include annotations for significant price changes or events on
  the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart, and if so, what
  should they be?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background or theme (light, dark,
  customized)?
