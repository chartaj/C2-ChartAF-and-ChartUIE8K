initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the capture data over different
  species of fish, highlighting the variations in their capture weights. The x-axis
  should represent the different species, and the y-axis should represent the capture
  weight in metric tons. Additionally, include lines that show the "Total by Group"
  and "Grand Total" for comparison. Make sure to differentiate the species by type
  (e.g., Finfish) using different colors or markers. This visualization will help
  in understanding the distribution and differences in capture weights across various
  fish species.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the species
  types?

  2. Would you like specific markers (e.g., circle, square, triangle) to be used for
  different species types?

  3. Should the lines representing "Total by Group" and "Grand Total" be styled differently
  (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or data labels you''d like to include on the
  chart?

  6. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?

  7. Would you prefer gridlines on the chart? If so, for both axes or just one?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  9. Do you have any preference for the axis ranges, or should they be auto-scaled
  based on the data?

  10. Are there any additional data points or references you would like to highlight
  specifically?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, different styles would be helpful.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I prefer it to be on the right.

  7. Yes, gridlines on both axes would be good.

  8. "Capture Weights of Various Fish Species"

  9. Auto-scaled based on the data is fine.

  10. I do not know.'
