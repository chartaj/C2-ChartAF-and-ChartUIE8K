initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the capture weights of different fish
  species in relation to their LCA and Gephart categories. The x-axis should represent
  the species, the y-axis should represent the categories (LCA and Gephart combined),
  and the color intensity should represent the capture values. Highlight same-species
  variations within multiple categories. Include data labels for capture weights.
  Use a gradient color scheme for better clarity. Emphasize missing data points by
  a distinguishable pattern or color. Make sure the heatmap is clear and easily interpretable.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for specific color gradients for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the missing data points to be represented (e.g., specific
  color or pattern)?

  3. Should the data labels for capture weights be displayed on all cells, or only
  on cells with data?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the data labels and axis labels?

  5. Would you prefer a specific ordering of fish species and categories on the axes?

  6. Is there a particular range or set of thresholds for the color intensity you
  want to emphasize?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference for color gradients.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a specific pattern like stripes or a distinct color?

  3. Data labels for capture weights on all cells, please.

  4. I have no specific preference for fonts.

  5. I do not have a specific ordering preference for the axes.

  6. I do not know any specific set of thresholds.

  7. I have no specific preference for the layout or aspect ratio.

  8. I am not sure; whatever you think best for clarity.
