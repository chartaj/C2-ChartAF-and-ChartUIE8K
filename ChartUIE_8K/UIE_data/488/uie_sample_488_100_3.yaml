initial_prompt: Could you create a histogram that shows the distribution of the 'Weighting'
  values from the data provided? I am interested in seeing how the weighting is spread
  across different species. Make sure to label the axes appropriately, with 'Weighting'
  on the x-axis and 'Frequency' on the y-axis. Including a title like 'Distribution
  of Fish Weighting' would be helpful for clarity. Additionally, highlight any significant
  peaks or gaps in the distribution if they are notable. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. What specific bin size or number of bins would you like to use for the histogram?

  3. Should the histogram include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific species you would like to highlight or annotate separately?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Is there a particular way you prefer the significant peaks or gaps to be highlighted
  (e.g., different color, annotation)?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included in the histogram? If so, what details
  should it contain?

  8. Should the chart include any additional information or annotations aside from
  highlighting peaks and gaps?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Different color would be fine.

  7. No, a legend is not necessary.

  8. I do not think any additional information or annotations are needed.'
