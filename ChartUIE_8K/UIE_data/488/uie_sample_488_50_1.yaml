initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap displaying fish capture data by species
  and category. Use color gradients to highlight capture volumes, focusing on areas
  with high capture densities. Annotate specific regions with the highest capture
  rates for emphasis, and include non-data-driven annotations for context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradients used for capture
  volumes?

  3. Are there any specific regions or areas you want to emphasize more than others?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for annotations?

  5. Should the annotations include additional information apart from the capture
  rates?

  6. Would you like to display geographic boundaries such as countries or states/regions
  on the map?

  7. Is there any specific map projection or style you prefer for the geographic visualization?

  8. Do you have preferences for the granularity of the capture data (e.g., by specific
  coordinates, aggregates by region)?

  9. Should the non-data-driven annotations include specific contextual information
  such as economic importance, conservation status, or policy notes?

  10. Are there any additional data layers or points of interest that you would like
  to overlay on the map?'
