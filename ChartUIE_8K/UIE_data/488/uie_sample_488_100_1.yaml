initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the capture distribution of
  different fish species. Highlight regions with higher capture values using varying
  colors. Annotate key points showing species names and capture numbers to focus on
  significant data. Use the weighting column to adjust the intensity of the colors,
  reflecting the species' relative importance. This chart will provide an overview
  of fish capture geographically, making it easier to identify regions of high activity
  and key species contributing to those figures. Incorporate descriptive text annotations
  for context and highlights for distinct data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the intensity of colors to be adjusted based on the weighting?

  3. Are there specific species or regions you want to emphasize with distinct annotations?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for the geographic regions displayed?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color intensities and their
  corresponding values?

  6. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the text annotations?

  7. Would you like the chart to include any additional contextual information or
  notes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t know.

  3. Yes, could you emphasize the species like Tuna in the Pacific region and Salmon
  in the North Atlantic region?

  4. I prefer moderate granularity, showing prominent regions clearly.

  5. Yes, please include a legend.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have any specific preference.'
