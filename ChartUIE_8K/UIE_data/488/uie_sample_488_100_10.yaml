initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart that shows the distribution of 'Capture'
  for different 'Species' within the 'Finfish' type. The chart should highlight the
  proportions of capture amounts for Anchovy, Pollock, and Tuna. Ensure the pie chart
  segments are labeled with the respective species names and their corresponding capture
  values. This pie chart will help visualize the relative capture sizes among these
  species, emphasizing which finfish species have the highest and lowest captures
  in the dataset. Please use different colors for each species to make the chart more
  visually distinct and comprehensible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for each species?

  2. Should the chart include a legend in addition to the labels on the pie segments?

  3. Do you want the capture values displayed as absolute numbers, percentages, or
  both?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the pie chart? If so, please specify the
  title.

  6. Do you want additional annotations or notes on the chart? If yes, please specify
  the details.

  7. Should the pie segments be separated or have a "pull-out" effect for better visual
  distinction?'
