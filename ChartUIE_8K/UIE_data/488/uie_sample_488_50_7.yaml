initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the weighting distribution across different
  fish species and capture types. Highlight areas with high and low weighting values
  to identify patterns and outliers in the dataset. Use colors to represent varying
  weighting scales.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or gradients you prefer for
  the weighting scales?

  2. How many distinct color ranges would you like to see in the heatmap to represent
  varying weighting values?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to have a color legend to explain the weighting scales
  explicitly?

  4. Should the heatmap include axis labels for ''Species'' and ''Capture'' types,
  or would you prefer simplified labels/annotations?

  5. Do you prefer the data points (cells) in the heatmap to display the actual ''Weighting''
  values, or would color coding alone suffice?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for labels and annotations
  within the heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include any supplementary visual elements like grids or borders
  around cells to enhance readability?

  8. Are there any specific species or capture types you want to highlight or focus
  on within the heatmap?

  9. Should we include any additional statistical markers (e.g., mean lines, outlier
  indications) to emphasize patterns or outliers?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like the heatmap to have a color legend.

  4. Simplified labels/annotations would be good.

  5. Color coding alone will suffice.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have any specific species or capture types to highlight.

  9. I am not sure.'
