initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that shows the total capture weights for
  different species, grouped by "Gephart Category." Use "Type" as different color
  segments within each bar. Display species on the x-axis and capture weight on the
  y-axis. Please ensure the "Type," "Species," "Gephart Category," and "Capture" columns
  are clearly labeled. Make sure the legend indicates which color corresponds to which
  "Type." This will help visualize the distribution of capture weights across different
  species and categories effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different "Type" segments?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations on the bars?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order of species displayed on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis be displayed with a specific range or scale (e.g., logarithmic)?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical orientation for the bar chart?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for font styles or sizes for labels and
  legends?

  8. Would you like to include data values directly on the bars?
