initial_prompt: 'I have raw data on different fish species, their categories, capture
  rates, and weightings from an Excel file. I need a grouped column chart that will
  visualize the capture rates and weightings for each species categorized by their
  ''Gephart Category''. Each species should have two bars: one for the ''Capture''
  column and one for the ''Weighting'' column. Additionally, ensure that fish grouped
  under the same ''Gephart Category'' are visually clear, so I can easily compare
  capture rates and weightings across different categories and species. Add legends
  and labels for clarity.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different bars representing
  ''Capture'' and ''Weighting'' values?

  2. Would you prefer the bars within each ''Gephart Category'' to be grouped together
  with distinct colors for each category?

  3. Do you have specific preferences for the font style and size of the labels and
  legends?

  4. Should the x-axis labels include both the ''Species'' and ''Gephart Category''
  for clarity, or would you prefer a different labeling approach?

  5. Do you have a preferred order for the ''Gephart Categories'' and ''Species''
  to appear on the x-axis?

  6. Would you like to display gridlines on the chart for easier comparison of values,
  or would you prefer a cleaner look without gridlines?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement of the legend (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right of the chart)?

  8. Should the y-axis have a consistent scale across all ''Gephart Categories'' for
  easier comparison, or should it be auto-scaled to fit the data range for each category?

  9. Would you like to include any reference lines or annotations to highlight specific
  capture rates or weightings?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and subtitle?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would prefer the bars within each ''Gephart Category'' to be grouped together
  with distinct colors for each category.

  5. I do not have a preferred order for the ''Gephart Categories'' and ''Species''
  to appear on the x-axis.

  6. I would prefer to display gridlines on the chart for easier comparison of values.

  7. I am not sure about the placement of the legend; please choose what you think
  works best.

  8. The y-axis should have a consistent scale across all ''Gephart Categories'' for
  easier comparison.

  9. No, I do not need any reference lines or annotations.

  10. I do not have any specific preferences for the chart title and subtitle; use
  what you think would be clear and informative.'
