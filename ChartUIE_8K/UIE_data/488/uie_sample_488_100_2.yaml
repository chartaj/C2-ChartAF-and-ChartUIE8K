initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the "Weighting" of different "Species"
  of "Finfish." Highlight values with a distinctive color to emphasize species with
  higher "Weighting." Include text annotations specifically for the species "Anchovy,"
  "Pollock," and "Tuna," detailing their respective "Capture" values. The purpose
  is to easily identify and compare the weighting across species, focusing initially
  on these three species before examining others. This will help in the study of fish
  species' ecological impact and their capture volumes. Keep annotations and highlights
  concise for readability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting species with
  higher weighting?

  2. What color would you like to use for the text annotations of Anchovy, Pollock,
  and Tuna?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the arrangement of the dot plot (e.g., vertical
  vs. horizontal orientation)?

  5. Would you like any additional information or labels to be included in the chart
  (e.g., axis titles, legend)?

  6. Are there any specific chart titles or subtitles you want?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for the data points (e.g., circles, squares) in
  the dot plot?

  8. Is there a specific background color or gridline style you would like for the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer the text annotations for Anchovy, Pollock, and Tuna to be in blue.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include axis titles and a legend.

  6. Yes, title: "Weighting of Different Finfish Species," subtitle: "Focused Analysis
  on Anchovy, Pollock, and Tuna Capture Volumes."

  7. Circles would be preferred for the data points.

  8. I am not sure.'
