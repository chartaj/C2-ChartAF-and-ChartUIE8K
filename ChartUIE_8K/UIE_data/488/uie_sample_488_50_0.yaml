initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize the weight distribution of different
  fish species categorized by 'Gephart Category.' Highlight outliers and use text
  annotations to show mean values. Make sure to emphasize the 'Capture' data and use
  distinct colors for each category for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for specific colors to distinguish each
  ''Gephart Category''?

  2. Would you like the box plot to display individual data points in addition to
  the boxes, or just the summary statistics?

  3. How would you prefer outliers to be marked on the box plot (e.g., different shapes,
  colors)?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations showing
  the mean values?

  5. Do you have any specific labeling format for the x-axis (e.g., full category
  name or abbreviations)?

  6. Would you prefer the y-axis to be in a specific range or scale (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the background of the plot, and if so, in what style
  (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  8. Should the plot include a title and legend, and if so, any preferences on how
  they should be formatted?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you would like for the plot?'
