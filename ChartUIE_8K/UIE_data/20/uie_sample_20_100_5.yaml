initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the number of paintings by famous artists
  over time. Use the 'years' and 'paintings' columns from '20.csv' to plot the data.
  The x-axis should represent the mid-year of the 'years' range, and the y-axis should
  show the count of paintings. Each artist should have their own line to highlight
  the differences in their productive periods. Label each line with the artist's name
  from the 'name' column. This visualization will help compare the artistic output
  of different artists throughout their careers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  artists?

  2. Would you like to include markers on the lines to highlight specific data points?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legends?

  4. Should the x-axis be formatted in a particular way (e.g., specific time intervals,
  date format)?

  5. Would you like gridlines in the background to enhance readability?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you have preferences for the positioning of the legend?

  8. Should we apply any smoothing techniques to the lines to better visualize trends?

  9. Are there any particular annotations you would like to add to the chart?

  10. Do you have preferences for labeling the mid-year of the ''years'' range on
  the x-axis?'
