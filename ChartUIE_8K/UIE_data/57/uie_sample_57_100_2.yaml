initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization using the provided data on customer
  acquisition channels, costs, conversion rates, and revenues. The treemap should
  use the "channel" data for categorization, with each segment's size representing
  the "cost" and color intensity representing the "conversion_rate." Use annotations
  to highlight the top three revenue-generating channels. The purpose is to identify
  the most cost-effective channels for customer acquisition. Ensure the chart visually
  distinguishes key channels and includes text annotations for clarity. This will
  help us in our business decision-making process by focusing on the most efficient
  channels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the treemap, especially
  for representing the conversion_rate?

  2. Is there a preferred threshold or range of conversion_rate that you would like
  to see specifically highlighted in the treemap?

  3. How would you like the annotations for the top three revenue-generating channels
  to appear? Should they be bold, italicized, different colors, etc.?

  4. Are there specific labels or titles you would like to include on the treemap
  for better readability?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the color intensities
  and how they relate to conversion_rate, or any other aspect of the data?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations to ensure
  clarity?

  7. Is there a specific layout or orientation for the treemap that you prefer (e.g.,
  horizontal vs vertical)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional data points or metrics in the treemap
  that might help in decision-making?'
