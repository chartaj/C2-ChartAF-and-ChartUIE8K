initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart using the data from "Customer Lifetime
  Value Analytics: Case Study". The X-axis should represent the different "channels"
  while the Y-axis should have two lines representing "cost" and "conversion_rate".
  Make sure the data points for each channel are clearly marked and distinguish between
  the two lines using different colors or styles. This will help us compare how the
  cost and conversion rate fluctuate across different marketing channels. Including
  sample data points in the visualization would be helpful. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors used to differentiate between
  the ''cost'' and ''conversion_rate'' lines?

  2. Would you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the ''cost''
  and ''conversion_rate'' lines?

  3. How would you like the data points to be marked (e.g., circles, squares) on the
  chart?

  4. Should there be a legend to explain the colors and styles used? If so, where
  would you prefer it to be placed?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart to make the data points easier to read?
  If yes, both horizontal and vertical?

  6. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like to include for the chart?

  7. Do you have any particular axis label preferences for the X-axis (channels) and
  Y-axis (values of cost and conversion rate)?

  8. Would you prefer to display numerical values at the data points for better readability?

  9. Do you have a preferred font or style for the text elements (axis labels, title,
  legend) on the chart?'
