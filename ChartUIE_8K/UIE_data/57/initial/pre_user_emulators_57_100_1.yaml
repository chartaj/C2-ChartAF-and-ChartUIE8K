2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of revenue across different channels.
  Highlight key data points like the mean and median values of revenue, and add text
  annotations for outliers or notable peaks. Ensure the x-axis represents revenue
  bins, and the y-axis shows the frequency of customers. This visualization should
  help identify which channels yield higher revenue and understand the overall revenue
  distribution. It will support analysis for optimizing customer acquisition strategies
  and budget allocation in different marketing channels. Make the chart clear and
  easy to understand for better data-driven decision-making.
