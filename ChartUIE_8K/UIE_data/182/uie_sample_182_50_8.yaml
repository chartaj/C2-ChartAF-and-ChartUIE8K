  Differentiate genres using bubble colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to differentiate between
  genres?

  2. Would you like to add labels to the bubbles for better identification? If so,
  which attribute should be labeled?

  3. Do you have a specific size range for the bubbles to ensure they are clearly
  visible but not overlapping too much?

  4. Should there be any specific formatting for the axes, such as log scale for better
  distribution visualization?

  5. Do you want a legend to explain the genre colors, and if so, where should it
  be positioned?

  6. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include in the bubble
  chart?

  7. Are there any specific gridlines or reference lines you would like to add to
  the chart for better context?'
