initial_prompt: 'Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of genres in the
  Books Sales and Ratings dataset from arts-and-entertainment. Each slice should represent
  a different genre and its proportion to the total number of books. Use the ''genre''
  column for the categories and count the occurrences of each genre to determine the
  sizes of the slices. The chart should help understand which genres are most represented
  in the dataset. Ensure the chart is labeled clearly with the genre names and include
  a legend for easy interpretation. Add a title: "Distribution of Book Genres in Sales
  and Ratings".'
