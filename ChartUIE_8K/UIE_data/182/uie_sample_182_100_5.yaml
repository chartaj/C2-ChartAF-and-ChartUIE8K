initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of "Book_average_rating"
  across different "Author_Rating" levels. Use "Author_Rating" as the categorical
  axis and "Book_average_rating" as the numerical axis. Additionally, include color
  coding for different "genre" types. The chart should help identify the range and
  spread of book ratings associated with various author expertise levels and different
  genres. This comparison will be beneficial to see how author experience and genre
  influence average book ratings in the arts-and-entertainment book sales and ratings
  dataset.
