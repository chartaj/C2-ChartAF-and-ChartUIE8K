initial_prompt: 'I have three columns of data: ''x'', ''y'', and ''group''. ''x''
  and ''y'' are numerical with no missing values, while ''group'' is categorical with
  three unique values (A, B, C). I want a strip plot to visualize the data distribution
  and group comparison for a mineral reserves estimate project in the energy sector.
  Could you create a strip plot that displays the ''x'' and ''y'' values grouped by
  ''group''? Make sure the plot clearly shows the different categories (A, B, C) for
  easy comparison. Include appropriate labels and titles. Thanks!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing the different
  categories (A, B, C)?

  2. Would you prefer the x-axis to display ''x'' values and the y-axis to display
  ''y'' values, or vice versa?

  3. Should the strip plot include any reference lines or markers (such as median
  or mean lines) for the groups?

  4. Do you prefer any specific style or font for the labels and titles on the chart?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot for better readability?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the plot, or do you have
  any preference for how it should look?

  7. Are there any specific aspects of the data or context you want highlighted in
  the title or subtitle of the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the spacing and alignment of the categories on the
  plot?'
