initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the mineral reserves estimate within
  the energy sector. Use 'x' for one metric (e.g., reserve size), 'y' for another
  (e.g., extraction cost), and 'group' to categorize the minerals into different types.
  Highlight top-performing minerals with text annotations showing specific values.
  Use shape annotations like trend lines to indicate patterns or comparisons. The
  chart should focus on making it easier to understand the distribution and cost implications
  of different mineral reserves. Include non-data-driven annotations to provide context
  about the energy sector’s reserves.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different mineral groups
  in the bubble chart?

  2. How would you like to distinguish the top-performing minerals apart from text
  annotations? (e.g., different bubble sizes, colors, or borders)

  3. Do you have a preferred axis scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for the x and
  y metrics?

  4. Are there any specific benchmarks or reference lines you would like to include
  on the chart?

  5. What level of detail would you like for the non-data-driven annotations about
  the energy sector’s reserves?

  6. Should the trend lines be for all data points together or separated by mineral
  group?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for text annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different bubble sizes would be great.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. A moderate level of detail for the non-data-driven annotations would be fine.

  6. Trend lines separated by mineral group would be helpful.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
