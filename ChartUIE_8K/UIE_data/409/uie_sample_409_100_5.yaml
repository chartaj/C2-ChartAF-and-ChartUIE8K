initial_prompt: I have data on mineral reserves estimation classified by groups with
  variables x and y in a CSV. I need a density plot to visualize this data. Could
  you please create a density plot that shows the distribution of x and y values for
  each group (A, B, C)? Ensure that the density for each group is represented with
  different colors or patterns. I would like the plot to help in understanding the
  concentration and spread of the mineral reserves data across different groups. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different groups in the
  density plot?

  2. Would you like the plot to have a legend showing which color represents each
  group?

  3. Do you prefer any specific type of density estimate (e.g., KDE, histogram)?

  4. Should the density plot include contour lines, or would you prefer filled contours?

  5. Is there a particular way you want the axes to be labeled or any specific titles
  for the plot?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the plot?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the patterns representing different groups,
  or is color differentiation sufficient?

  8. Any specific preferences for the plot background (e.g., white or a light shade)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Yes, I would like the plot to have a legend showing which color represents each
  group.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Filled contours would be great.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Color differentiation is sufficient.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
