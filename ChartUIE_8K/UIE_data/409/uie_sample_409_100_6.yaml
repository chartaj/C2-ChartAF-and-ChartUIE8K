initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the mineral reserves estimate data
  for energy resources. The scatter plot should have 'x' on the x-axis and 'y' on
  the y-axis, using different colors to represent the three distinct groups. Please
  ensure to label the axes, title the chart appropriately, and include a legend to
  differentiate between groups A, B, and C. The chart should help in visualizing any
  patterns, trends, or clusters among the groups. Make it clear and easy to interpret
  for stakeholders interested in our mineral energy reserves. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. What specific labels would you like on the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Is there a particular color palette you prefer for differentiating the groups
  (A, B, C)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot?

  5. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  6. Do you have any specific markers or shapes in mind for the scatter plot points?

  7. Would you prefer the chart background to be in a specific color?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred title for the chart.

  2. x-axis: "Mineral Reserves Estimate", y-axis: "Energy Resource Value"

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, include gridlines in the scatter plot.

  5. Top-right

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. No specific background color.

  8. I do not know.'
