initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the 'x' and 'y' values, grouped by 'group'.
  Use text annotations for notable data points, emphasizing distinctions among groups.
  Highlight trends to aid energy sector analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific range or scaling for the color intensity in the heatmap?

  3. Are there particular thresholds or notable points you already know of that should
  be annotated?

  4. How would you like the data points to be grouped or differentiated within the
  heatmap (e.g., color-coding, symbols)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of text annotations for
  notable data points?

  6. Are there any specific trends or patterns you are particularly interested in
  highlighting?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to indicate which colors represent which
  groups or values?

  8. Do you prefer a specific axis scaling (linear, logarithmic) for ''x'' and ''y''
  values?

  9. Would you like any specific gridlines or divisions within the heatmap to be emphasized?

  10. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to be included in the chart
  for clarity and context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, particularly where there are significant peaks or troughs in ''x'' and ''y''
  values.

  4. Color-coding would be good.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am particularly interested in highlighting any rapid changes or significant
  deviations in ''x'' and ''y'' values among the groups.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, please include labels for axes and a title that mentions the energy sector
  analysis context.'
