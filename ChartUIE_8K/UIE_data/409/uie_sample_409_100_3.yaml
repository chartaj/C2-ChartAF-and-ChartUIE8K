initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of 'x' and
  'y' values divided by the 'group' category. This will help us compare the central
  tendencies and ranges for each group ('A', 'B', 'C'). Ensure the plot clearly shows
  the quartiles, medians, and any outliers. This visualization will assist in assessing
  the variation in mineral reserves estimates for energy groups across different categories.
  Use different colors for each group for better distinction. Adding a title and axis
  labels will enhance clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific title in mind for the box plot?

  2. What labels would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have specific colors in mind for groups ''A'', ''B'', and ''C''?

  4. Would you like a legend to be included in the plot?

  5. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer a certain font style or size for the text in the plot?

  7. Are there any specific outlier markers you want to use for the plot?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations on the plot?

  9. Do you want to adjust the range of values displayed on the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, perhaps "Distribution of Mineral Reserves Estimates by
  Group".

  2. x-axis: "Group Category", y-axis: "Values of x and y".

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include a legend.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
