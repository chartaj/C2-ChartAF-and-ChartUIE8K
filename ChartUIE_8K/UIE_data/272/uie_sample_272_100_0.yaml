initial_prompt: Visualize the global EV sales data from 2010 to 2024 with a column
  chart that highlights the trends over the years. Annotate key data points like the
  highest and lowest sales years and significant milestones to draw attention. Use
  different colors for various powertrains (EV, BEV) to distinguish between categories,
  and add text annotations for context, such as percentage shares. Highlight specific
  regions like Australia where detailed data is provided. This will help emphasize
  how EV adoption has evolved globally and understand regional differences in EV market
  growth.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for distinguishing between the different
  powertrains (EV, BEV)?

  2. What specific milestones would you like to highlight in the annotations?

  3. How would you like key data points such as the highest and lowest sales years
  to be annotated (e.g., with markers, text).

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the text annotations?

  5. Would you like any particular regions to be emphasized other than Australia?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you want to include on the chart?

  7. Should the trend lines or bars have any specific patterns or textures to differentiate
  them aside from colors?

  8. How granular should the year axis be (e.g., every year, every 5 years)?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart (e.g., landscape, portrait)?

  10. Would you like any additional contextual information or notes included in the
  chart for better understanding?'
