02_initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of EV sales
  and stock share in Australia from 2010 to 2024. Use different colors for "EV stock
  share" and "EV sales share" under the "parameter" column. The x-axis should represent
  the years, and the y-axis should show the value in their respective units ("percent"
  for stock and sales share). Include a legend to differentiate between the two parameters,
  and ensure the plot clearly displays variance and distribution over the years. This
  will help quickly understand the trend and spread of EV adoption in Australia.
