initial_prompt: Visualize the global EV sales data from 2010-2024 using a heatmap.
  Highlight the regions with the highest and lowest values to capture regional variations
  and trends over time. Integrate text annotations to emphasize significant sales
  changes in specific regions. Highlight years where there are notable spikes or drops.
  This visualization aims to provide insights into regional performance and assist
  in forecasting future trends. Please ensure the chart captures key data points and
  trends clearly, helping to identify areas of growth or decline within the global
  EV market.
