  For data attributes needed in data visualization, store them in query[''Data Attribute''].
  Data attributes MUST match exactly the column names of the data.

  Store the selected task from the task types in query[''Task''].

  Store the purpose of visualization in query[''Purpose''].

  Store the prospective audience in query[''Audience''].

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Do you want each attribute (e.g., PWR, SPD) to be displayed in separate subplots
  or combined in a single plot?

  3. Are there particular significant values you want to be annotated or should it
  be based on certain criteria (like top 10%)?

  4. How would you like the most common unique values to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, bold outline)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish the different Stand attributes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Should the bars be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending, descending, alphabetical)?

  8. Do you want any gridlines or specific styling for the background of the chart?

  9. Is there any specific font or size you want for the annotations and labels?'
