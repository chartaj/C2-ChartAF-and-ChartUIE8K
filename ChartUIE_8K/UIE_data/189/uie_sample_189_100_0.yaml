initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the various attributes of different
  Stands from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure. Use the columns 'PWR', 'SPD', 'RNG', 'PER',
  'PRC', and 'DEV' to compare the performance metrics of the Stands listed in the
  'Stand' column. Annotate specific data points that stand out, such as the highest
  'PWR' and 'PER'. Highlight elements like unique stands or those with extreme values
  to draw attention. The chart should help fans understand and compare the strengths
  and weaknesses of each Stand in a clear and engaging way.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be grouped by Stand or by attribute (PWR, SPD, RNG, etc.)?

  3. How would you like the bars or attributes to be ordered (e.g., alphabetical,
  by performance level)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and annotations?

  5. Should we use different patterns or textures for bars to highlight specific attributes?

  6. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a preferred location for the legend on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. What style of annotations do you prefer for highlighting extreme values (e.g.,
  arrows, color change, bold text)?

  9. Do you want a separate section for the title and axis labels or should they be
  embedded within the chart area?

  10. Should we include a summary or key insights below the chart to help with interpretation?'
