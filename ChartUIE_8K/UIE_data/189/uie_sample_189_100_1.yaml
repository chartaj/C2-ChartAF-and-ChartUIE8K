initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the attribute levels (PWR, SPD, RNG,
  PER, PRC, DEV) of different 'Jojo's Bizarre Adventure' Stands. Each cell should
  represent the value of an attribute for a specific Stand. Use annotations to highlight
  average values or outliers in each attribute to draw attention. This will help in
  easily identifying powerful and less effective Stands. The heatmap will provide
  a comprehensive comparison, making it easier to spot patterns and differences among
  the Stands' abilities.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should we represent higher values with a specific color intensity or gradient?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., specific symbols for
  outliers, numeric values for averages)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or color scale to indicate the meaning of
  various colors and intensities?

  6. Should any specific attributes be highlighted more prominently than others?

  7. Are there any preferred sorting criteria for the Stands (e.g., alphanumeric order,
  by average power level)?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines to separate the cells more clearly?

  9. Are there any additional comparative statistics or information you would like
  to include in the heatmap?

  10. Do you prefer the heatmap to have a particular aspect ratio or orientation (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal)?'
