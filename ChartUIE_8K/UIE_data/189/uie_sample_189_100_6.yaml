initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the attributes of Stands from
  Jojo's Bizarre Adventure, focusing on their power (PWR), speed (SPD), range (RNG),
  precision (PRC), persistence (PER), and development potential (DEV). I want the
  X-axis to display the names of the Stands and the Y-axis to represent the counts
  for each attribute category (A, B, C, D, E). Each bar should be segmented by these
  different categories (A, B, C, D, E) to show the distribution of attributes per
  Stand. Please ensure the chart is colorful and properly labeled for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to be used in the stacked
  bar chart?

  2. How would you like the labels for each segment (A, B, C, D, E) to be displayed?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to describe what each color represents?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you would prefer for the axis labels
  and titles?

  5. Should the bars have grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the X-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, angled)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or highlights on specific
  data points?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the attribute categories to appear
  in each bar segment?'
