initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the power (PWR), speed (SPD), range
  (RNG), precision (PRC), and development potential (DEV) of Stands from "Jojo's Bizarre
  Adventure." Use unique values on the x-axis and indicate the number of missing values
  for each attribute. Make sure to plot each attribute as a separate line on the chart
  to show how these characteristics vary among different Stands. This chart will help
  fans analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various Stands in the series. Include
  clear labels and a legend for each attribute.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the lines representing\
  \ each attribute?\n2. Would you like to highlight specific Stands or data points\
  \ in the chart?\n3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like\
  \ to include on the chart?\n4. Would you prefer a specific style for the line (e.g.,\
  \ solid, dashed, dotted) for any of the attributes?\n5. Do you want to set specific\
  \ ranges or limits on the y-axis? \n6. Is there a particular font style or size\
  \ you prefer for the labels and legends?\n7. Do you have a preferred positioning\
  \ for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)? \n8. Would you like to see gridlines\
  \ on the chart for better readability? If so, any specific preferences for their\
  \ appearance?\n9. Are there any specific points of the data where you would like\
  \ tooltips or additional information to be displayed on hovering?\n10. Would you\
  \ like to see trend lines or moving averages for any of the attributes?"
