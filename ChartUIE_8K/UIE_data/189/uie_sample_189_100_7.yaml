initial_prompt: I have data on various stands from "Jojo's Bizarre Adventure" with
  attributes such as Power (PWR), Speed (SPD), Range (RNG), Precision (PRC), and so
  on. I'd like to visualize this data using a treemap. The chart should show the distribution
  and comparison of stands based on these attributes. Highlight stands with missing
  values in a different color or shade to emphasize data gaps. Also, categorize stands
  by unique values for each attribute to see how many stands fall into each category.
  Make it vibrant and easy to understand, reflecting the show's colorful nature.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing stands
  with missing values?

  2. What color palette would you like to use for the different categories in the
  treemap to reflect the vibrant and colorful nature of the show?

  3. How would you like to label the categories within the treemap?

  4. Do you have specific preferences for the font style and size for the text within
  the chart?

  5. Would you like to include any specific legends or keys to explain the different
  colors and categories?

  6. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you''d like to see on the
  treemap?'
