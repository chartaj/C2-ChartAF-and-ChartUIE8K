initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualizing the distribution of stands in Jojo's
  Bizarre Adventure based on their power (PWR), speed (SPD), and range (RNG) ratings.
  Each segment should represent a stand, with colors and sizes indicating the ratings
  values for easy comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the different ratings
  (PWR, SPD, RNG)?

  2. How would you like the size of the segments to be represented (based on a specific
  rating or a combination)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling for each segment (e.g., showing the stand
  name or rating values)?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color and size representations,
  and if so, do you have any preferences for its placement?

  5. Would you like the treemap to be segmented by any specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  rating values)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the treemap?

  7. Is there any specific additional information or meta-data you’d like to include
  in the treemap for context?'
