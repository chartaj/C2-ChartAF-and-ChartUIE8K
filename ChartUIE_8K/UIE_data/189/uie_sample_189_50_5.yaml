initial_prompt: 'Create a dot plot to visualize Stand attributes in "Jojo''s Bizarre
  Adventure". Use columns: Stand, PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV. Plot Stand names on
  the y-axis and attribute grades on the x-axis. Mark dots for each attribute per
  Stand.'

  SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the appearance of the grid lines on
  the dot plot?

  6. Would you like any annotations or specific markers for high or low attribute
  values?
