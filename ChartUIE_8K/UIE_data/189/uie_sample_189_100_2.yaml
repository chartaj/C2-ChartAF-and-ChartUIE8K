initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of values within
  each attribute (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) for the stands listed in Jojo's Bizarre
  Adventure dataset. Highlight the Boxes for attributes with higher median (e.g.,
  PWR and PER) to emphasize their significance. Include text annotations to display
  values for these attributes above select points and mention unique values as labels.
  This will help users quickly grasp which attributes are more pronounced or varied,
  providing insight into the distribution of stand attributes. Make use of color variations
  to distinguish between the different attribute columns.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing between different
  attribute columns?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style or format of text annotations?

  3. Would you like specific colors for highlighting the boxes with higher median
  values?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  5. Do you have any preference for the layout or orientation of the chart (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal box plots)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading to enhance readability?

  7. Do you prefer specific markers or symbols for the unique values as labels?

  8. Should outliers be marked differently in the box chart? If so, how?

  9. Is there a specific way you''d like the legend to be organized or displayed?

  10. Do you have any requirements for the spacing or padding between different boxes
  in the chart?'
