initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using Jojo's Bizarre Adventure stand statistics.
  Plot different stands based on their power (PWR) and speed (SPD) attributes. Each
  stand should be represented as a point, colored differently for visibility. Make
  sure to label stands and axes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the points representing different
  stands?

  2. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding?

  3. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like on the axes beyond ''PWR''
  and ''SPD''?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for labels and titles on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the data points be annotated with the name of each stand?

  7. Are there specific marker shapes you prefer for the data points?

  8. Do you want to include a trend line to highlight the correlation between PWR
  and SPD?

  9. Do you prefer specific axis scale types (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  10. Would you like to highlight any specific stands or groups of stands in the plot?'
