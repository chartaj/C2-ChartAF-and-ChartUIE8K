initial_prompt: I need a violin plot to visualize students' GPA distribution categorized
  by gender and race. Specifically, I want to see how male and female students' GPAs
  compare across different races. The plot should display the density of GPA values
  for each subgroup to understand variations within genders and races. This will help
  in analyzing performance trends in mathematics courses more effectively. Please
  make sure each violin segment is properly labeled so it's easy to distinguish between
  gender and race categories. Use data from the provided format for accurate representation.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different gender
  and race categories?

  2. Would you like to include summary statistics (e.g., median, quartiles) within
  the violin plot?

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal violin plots?

  4. How should the different categories (gender and race) be arranged within the
  plot (e.g., grouped by gender first or race first)?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  6. Is there any specific font type or size you would like for the labels and title?

  7. Should the axes be labeled in any particular way?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot, and if so, in what style?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers you wish to include in the plot?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the plot''s overall dimensions or
  aspect ratio?'
