initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize academic performance trends over
  various subjects for different genders and races. Use data from the education dataset,
  focusing on GPA, Algebra, Calculus1, Calculus2, Statistics, Probability, Measure,
  and Functional_analysis scores. Separate lines for male and female students and
  different races. The x-axis should represent the subjects, and the y-axis should
  show the scores. This visualization will help us identify patterns and differences
  in academic performance across demographics. The chart should display data points
  from the sample data provided in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for different
  genders and races?

  2. Do you want the chart to include a legend to differentiate between genders and
  races?

  3. Would you prefer a specific style for the lines (solid, dashed, dotted) representing
  different groups?

  4. Are there any specific subjects you want to highlight on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on each data point?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels and title?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, should they be for both the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the range or scale of the y-axis (e.g., starting
  at zero)?

  9. Would you like to have a title for the chart? If yes, please specify the title.

  10. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you want to be
  included in the chart?'
