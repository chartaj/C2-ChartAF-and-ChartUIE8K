initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot using the provided student data. Display
  GPA on the Y-axis and Algebra scores on the X-axis. Use different color markers
  to represent gender: blue for males and red for females. For further differentiation,
  shape the markers by class: circle for class A and square for class B. Include a
  legend to explain the colors and shapes. This visualization will help in understanding
  the relationship between Algebra scores and GPA, as well as identify any patterns
  related to gender and class. Make sure to title the chart as "Scatter Plot of GPA
  vs Algebra Scores."'
questions: '1. What size would you prefer for the scatter plot (e.g., width and height)?

  2. Do you have a specific color preference for the background of the chart?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart? If yes, do you prefer them
  to be in a specific style or color?

  4. What font style and size would you like for the title and axis labels?

  5. Do you need any specific labels or annotations for outliers or significant data
  points?

  6. Would you like axis titles for the X-axis and Y-axis to be different from the
  data attributes (Algebra and GPA)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific range or limits for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  8. Should there be any specific spacing or padding around the chart elements?

  9. Would you like to include data point values as labels directly on the scatter
  plot?'
answers: "1. I am not sure about the size. \n2. I do not have a specific color preference\
  \ for the background.\n3. Yes, include grid lines. I am not sure about the style\
  \ or color.\n4. I don't know about the font style and size; use something standard.\n\
  5. I am not sure about labeling outliers or significant data points.\n6. No, the\
  \ axis titles \"Algebra\" and \"GPA\" are fine.\n7. I do not have a specific range\
  \ or limit for the X-axis and Y-axis.\n8. I am not sure about spacing or padding.\n\
  9. No, I do not need data point values as labels directly on the scatter plot."
