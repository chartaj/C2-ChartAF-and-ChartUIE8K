initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing the differences in performance
  across various subjects for students. Use subjects like Algebra, Calculus1, Calculus2,
  Statistics, Probability, Measure, and Functional_analysis. Differentiate the radar
  chart based on gender and class categories. For clarity and comparison, please include
  three samples as given in the data. This will help in understanding how performance
  varies across subjects based on these factors. Please make the chart as informative
  and visually clear as possible, including distinct labels and legends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent different
  genders and classes?

  2. Would you like to specify the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for different
  groups in the radar chart?

  3. Do you have any preference for the size and format of the labels for each subject?

  4. Are there particular font styles or sizes you would like to use for the chart
  titles and legends?

  5. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for easier comparison?

  6. Should the data points on the radar chart be marked with symbols? If so, do you
  have a preference for specific symbols?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the subjects around the radar chart?

  8. Would you like to include additional annotations or comments on specific data
  points within the chart?

  9. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?'
