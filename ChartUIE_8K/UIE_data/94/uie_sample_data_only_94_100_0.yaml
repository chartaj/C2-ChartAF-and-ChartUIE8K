02_initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing global population trends from 1955
  to 2024, highlighting key data points such as yearly changes and median age. Annotate
  significant years with text annotations focusing on population peaks and dips, and
  demographic shifts. Use visual highlights to mark notable increments in population
  density and changes in fertility rates. The chart should emphasize population growth
  over time while providing context with annotations for easier understanding of socio-economic
  trends. The purpose is to visualize the global demographic changes for educational
  and analytical insights.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer clear and concise text annotations with arrows pointing to significant
  years and events.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Specific labeling styles or formats are not a priority for me.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would prefer distinct markers, such as circles or squares, and perhaps a different
  color for notable increments in population density and changes in fertility rates.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Line graph overlay or a secondary Y-axis for the median age data would be good.

  10. Highlight population peaks and dips with shaded regions or bold markers.'
