initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing global population trends from 1955 to
  2024, highlighting key data points such as yearly changes and median age. Annotate
  significant years with text annotations focusing on population peaks and dips, and
  demographic shifts. Use visual highlights to mark notable increments in population
  density and changes in fertility rates. The chart should emphasize population growth
  over time while providing context with annotations for easier understanding of socio-economic
  trends. The purpose is to visualize the global demographic changes for educational
  and analytical insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like significant years and events to be annotated? Any specific
  format or style for text annotations?

  3. Do you prefer certain types of lines (solid, dashed, etc.) for different data
  attributes?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the labels and
  titles?

  5. Should the X-axis and Y-axis have specific labeling styles or formats?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the placement of the legend on the chart?

  7. Are there any particular visual highlights or markers you would prefer for notable
  increments in population density and changes in fertility rates?

  8. Would you like any specific gridlines or background styles in the chart?

  9. How would you like the median age data to be represented in the chart?

  10. Is there any particular way you would like the population peaks and dips to
  be highlighted?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer clear and concise text annotations with arrows pointing to significant
  years and events.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Specific labeling styles or formats are not a priority for me.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would prefer distinct markers, such as circles or squares, and perhaps a different
  color for notable increments in population density and changes in fertility rates.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Line graph overlay or a secondary Y-axis for the median age data would be good.

  10. Highlight population peaks and dips with shaded regions or bold markers.'
