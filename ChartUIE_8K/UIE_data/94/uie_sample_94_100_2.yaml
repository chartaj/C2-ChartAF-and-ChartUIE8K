initial_prompt: Create an area chart visualizing global population growth from 1955
  to 2024. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight key data points for years
  1955, 1980, 2000, and 2024, showing population figures and yearly percentage changes.
  Apply highlights to emphasize significant changes in population density and median
  age over the years. Ensure the chart gives viewers a clear understanding of population
  trends, fertility rates, and demographic shifts such as median age. The chart should
  visually convey the magnitude of population growth and its implications on global
  density and social-economic factors.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different time periods
  or annotations?

  2. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preference on where the annotations should be placed on the chart
  (e.g., above, beside, or below the data points)?

  4. Are there any particular patterns or styles you would like for highlighting significant
  changes in population density and median age?

  5. Would you like to include any legends or keys to explain specific elements of
  the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  7. Would you like to add a title, subtitle, or notes to the chart? If yes, do you
  have any specific text in mind?

  8. Are there any specific gridlines or axes styles you prefer?

  9. Do you want the chart to start from zero on the Y-axis, or should it be adjusted
  to better visualize population changes?

  10. Would you prefer any specific shading or gradient effects in the area chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the font style or size for the text annotations.

  3. I would prefer the annotations to be placed near the data points, but I have
  no specific preference about the exact location.

  4. I do not know about particular patterns or styles for highlighting significant
  changes.

  5. Yes, I would like to include legends or keys to explain specific elements of
  the chart.

  6. I do not have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart.

  7. Yes, please include a title like "Global Population Growth (1955-2024)", and
  a subtitle like "Analyzing population trends and demographic shifts", but I don''t
  have specific notes in mind.

  8. I do not have any specific preferences for gridlines or axes styles.

  9. I am not sure whether the Y-axis should start from zero.

  10. I do not know about specific shading or gradient effects in the area chart.'
