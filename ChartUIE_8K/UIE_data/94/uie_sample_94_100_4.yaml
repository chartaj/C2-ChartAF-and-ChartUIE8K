initial_prompt: I want to visualize the world's population growth from 1955 to 2024
  using a scatter plot. The x-axis should represent the "Year" and the y-axis should
  represent the "Population." I am interested in seeing how the population has changed
  each year. Make sure to highlight data points for years 2022, 2023, and 2024 with
  different colors or markers. Also, include trend lines to show the overall growth
  trajectory over the years. Summary statistics like median age and fertility rate
  can be included, but focus mainly on population changes.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the scatter plot?

  2. What colors or markers would you like to use to highlight the data points for
  the years 2022, 2023, and 2024?

  3. Do you have any particular types of trend lines (e.g., linear, polynomial) you
  prefer to see in the scatter plot?

  4. Would you like to see the summary statistics (median age and fertility rate)
  in a specific section or as annotations on the plot?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for labels and annotations on the chart?

  6. Do you want any grid lines or a specific background color for the scatter plot?

  7. Should the trend lines be displayed in different colors or styles for better
  distinction?

  8. Are there any specific axis ranges (for x-axis or y-axis) you want to set manually?

  9. Would you like to include any additional reference lines or markers on the chart
  for significant years or milestones?

  10. Do you require any specific legends or titles for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.
