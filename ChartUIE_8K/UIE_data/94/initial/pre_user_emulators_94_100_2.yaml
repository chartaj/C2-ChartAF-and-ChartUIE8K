2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart visualizing global population growth from 1955 to 2024. Use
  data-driven text annotations to highlight key data points for years 1955, 1980,
  2000, and 2024, showing population figures and yearly percentage changes. Apply
  highlights to emphasize significant changes in population density and median age
  over the years. Ensure the chart gives viewers a clear understanding of population
  trends, fertility rates, and demographic shifts such as median age. The chart should
  visually convey the magnitude of population growth and its implications on global
  density and social-economic factors.
