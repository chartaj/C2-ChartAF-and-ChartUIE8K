2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap using the London bike sharing dataset. Plot 'timestamp' on the
  x-axis and 'season' on the y-axis. Use color to represent 'cnt' (bike count) values.
  Annotations should highlight data points where 'cnt' peaks, drawing attention to
  the times and seasons with the highest bike usage. This visualization will help
  identify peak usage patterns related to different seasons and times, useful for
  resource allocation and planning in social science research. Add text annotations
  to provide context such as weather conditions or holidays.
