initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the London bike sharing dataset to
  illustrate the distribution of bike counts ('cnt') over time. Emphasize the differences
  between weekdays and weekends with different colors. Use text annotations to highlight
  peak hours and unusual low counts. This visualization will help understand bike
  usage patterns and how external factors like weather or holidays influence them.
  Adjust axis labels for clarity and ensure the layout is user-friendly for social
  science research. Add notes to provide context about seasonal variations and extreme
  weather conditions impacting bike sharing.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  between weekdays and weekends?

  2. Are there specific hours or time ranges you would like to focus on for peak or
  unusually low bike counts?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for text annotations and axis labels?

  4. Should the histogram include a legend to explain the colors and annotations,
  or do you prefer it integrated into the notes?

  5. How would you like the seasonal variations and extreme weather conditions to
  be annotated or noted on the chart?

  6. Are there any particular seasons or weather conditions you want to highlight
  more prominently?

  7. Would you prefer the axis labels to be in a specific format (e.g., time format
  for ''timestamp'') for better clarity?

  8. Is there any additional contextual information you would like to see on the chart
  to aid in data interpretation?'
