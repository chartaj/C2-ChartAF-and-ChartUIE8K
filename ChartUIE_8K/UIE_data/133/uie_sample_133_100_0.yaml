initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the London bike sharing dataset. Plot 'timestamp'
  on the x-axis and 'season' on the y-axis. Use color to represent 'cnt' (bike count)
  values. Annotations should highlight data points where 'cnt' peaks, drawing attention
  to the times and seasons with the highest bike usage. This visualization will help
  identify peak usage patterns related to different seasons and times, useful for
  resource allocation and planning in social science research. Add text annotations
  to provide context such as weather conditions or holidays.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the weather conditions and holidays to be represented in the
  annotations?

  3. Do you have any specific time intervals you prefer for the ''timestamp'' axis
  (e.g., hourly, daily, monthly)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the heatmap for easier reading?

  5. Do you want the seasons to be labeled in any specific format (e.g., Winter, Spring,
  Summer, Autumn vs. numerical values)?

  6. Would you like a legend explaining the color gradient for ''cnt'' (bike count)
  values?

  7. Any specific font style or size preferences for the text annotations?

  8. Do you want to highlight peak usage using arrows or any other specific markers
  in the heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer any specific layout for the overall chart area (e.g., portrait
  or landscape orientation)?

  10. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the visualization?'
