initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize bike sharing counts (cnt) over time
  (timestamp) by weather_code. Annotate outliers in bike counts. Highlight significant
  differences across seasons to understand patterns influencing bike usage.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the outliers in bike counts to be annotated (e.g., different
  color, specific symbols)?

  3. Do you have a preference for how seasons should be highlighted on the heatmap
  (e.g., different background colors, borders)?

  4. How would you like the time intervals to be segmented on the heatmap (e.g., hourly,
  daily, monthly)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Would you like to include tooltips or labels that show precise values when hovered
  over specific areas?

  7. Should the heatmap display count values directly, or would you prefer using a
  color gradient to represent these values?

  8. Do you have any specific legends or keys you would like included to aid in interpreting
  the heatmap?

  9. Are there specific weather codes you would like highlighted or differentiated
  in a particular way?

  10. Is there any additional contextual or explanatory text you would like to include
  with the heatmap?'
