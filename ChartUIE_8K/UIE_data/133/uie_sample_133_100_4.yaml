initial_prompt: I want a stacked column chart to show the number of bike rentals (cnt)
  over time, comparing different seasons. Each column should represent a time segment
  (e.g., hours, days, or months) from the "timestamp" column. The segments within
  each column should be stacked based on the "season" column, showing how bike rentals
  vary by season throughout the timeline. This will help visualize seasonal patterns
  and the overall usage trends captured in the London bike sharing dataset. The y-axis
  should represent the bike rental count, and the x-axis should show the time.
questions: '1. What time segment granularity do you prefer for the x-axis (e.g., hourly,
  daily, or monthly)?

  2. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different seasons?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each segment within the columns?

  4. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate the seasons?

  6. Should the chart display grid lines for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the title and subtitle of the chart?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to add to emphasize
  certain data points or trends?'
answers: '1. Monthly granularity would be best.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. No specific preference for label styles.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate the seasons.

  6. Yes, displaying grid lines would be helpful.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No specific annotations or highlights needed.'
