initial_prompt: I have a dataset with timestamps, bike counts (cnt), temperatures
  (t1 and t2), humidity (hum), wind speed, weather code, holiday indicators (is_holiday),
  weekend indicators (is_weekend), and seasons. Please create a line chart displaying
  bike counts over time, with separate lines for different seasons. This will help
  us visualize how bike-sharing usage changes throughout the year and identify any
  seasonal trends. Make sure the x-axis represents the timestamp and the y-axis the
  bike count. Also, differentiate the lines by using distinct colors for each season.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific colors to represent each
  season?

  2. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the chart to highlight key
  events or trends?

  3. Is there a particular time interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) that you prefer
  for the x-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)
  that represent each season?

  5. Should the seasons be displayed in a particular order on the legend or chart?

  6. Do you want gridlines in the background to help in reading the values more easily?

  7. What title would you like for the chart?

  8. Do you want to include axis labels, and if so, what should they be?

  9. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the text elements in the
  chart?

  10. Are there any other specific visual elements you would like to include to enhance
  the readability of the chart?'
