initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the London bike sharing dataset to visualize
  the average count of shared bikes ('cnt') across different seasons. Use color highlights
  to distinguish between seasons. Add text annotations to display the highest and
  lowest average counts for better insight. The chart will help identify seasonal
  trends in bike sharing, assisting in planning and resource allocation. Include labels
  for each bar representing a season and a legend explaining the color coding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different seasons?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the text annotations?

  3. Should the legend be positioned in a specific part of the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  4. Would you prefer a specific bar width or spacing between bars?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the axis label font style and size?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart? If so, what style should they be?

  8. Are there any specific season labels you would prefer to be used in the chart?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the format of the text annotations (e.g., color,
  background)?

  10. Should the chart include any additional information or context that isn''t explicitly
  mentioned in the initial requirements?'
