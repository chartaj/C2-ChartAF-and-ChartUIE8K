2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a violin plot chart to visualize Google's stock market data in its founding
  years. The chart should display the distribution of the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and
  'Close' prices. Make sure to highlight key points like the highest and lowest prices
  to emphasize significant trends. Also, add text annotations to specific data points
  to highlight important values. This will help in understanding the performance over
  different dates, with focus on notable shifts in stock prices. Use colors to make
  outliers stand out. The goal is to quickly grasp the stock's volatility and trends
  from 2004 to 2008.
