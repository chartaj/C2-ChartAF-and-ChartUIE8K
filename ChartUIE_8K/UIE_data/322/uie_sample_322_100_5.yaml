initial_prompt: Please create an area chart for Google's stock market data from its
  founding years. The chart should show trends in 'Open', 'Close', 'High', and 'Low'
  prices over time. Use different colors to differentiate between these price points.
  Include the x-axis as 'Date' and the y-axis to represent price values. Make sure
  to also plot the 'Volume' as a secondary y-axis to show trading volume against the
  stock prices. Highlight significant dates, if any, with annotations. The goal is
  to visualize the stock performance and its trading volume over the years. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  ''Open'', ''Close'', ''High'', and ''Low'' prices?

  2. Are there certain significant dates that you would like to be highlighted or
  should we determine them based on data analysis?

  3. Do you have preferred styles for annotations (e.g., arrows, text boxes) for significant
  dates?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles for the axes and chart?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the chartâ€™s text elements (e.g.,
  axis labels, annotations)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the appearance of the secondary y-axis
  representing trading volume (e.g., color, line style)?

  7. Should the chart include a legend? If so, where would you prefer it to be placed
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Are there any particular gridline styles or background colors you would like
  for the chart?'
