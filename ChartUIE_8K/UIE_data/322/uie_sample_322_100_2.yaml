initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize Google's stock market activity from
  its early years. Use annotations to highlight key data points, such as opening and
  closing prices, and volume on significant trading days. Focus on the contrast between
  daily high and low prices to emphasize volatility. Use color variations to differentiate
  between periods of high and low activity, helping to identify trends over time.
  This visualization will provide a clear, engaging overview of stock performance
  and trading volume, aiding in historical analysis for business and investment insights.

  4. What level of granularity would you prefer for the time axis (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color variations in the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include gridlines to separate each data point or period?

  7. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include on the axes
  or overall chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional statistical information or indicators,
  such as moving averages or trend lines?'
