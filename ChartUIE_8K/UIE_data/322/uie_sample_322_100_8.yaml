initial_prompt: I need a line chart displaying Google's stock market trend during
  its initial years (starting from the founding years). Use the data from '../Extra_datas/data/322.csv'
  to plot the 'Close' prices against the 'Date'. The x-axis should represent the dates
  starting from 2004, and the y-axis should show the adjusted closing prices. This
  will help visualize how Google's stock value evolved in its early market years.
  Ensure the chart clearly marks the different dates and the corresponding closing
  values for better readability and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line and background?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included for better readability?

  3. Do you want data points to be marked on the line for each date?

  4. Should the chart include a title and labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges you would like to highlight on the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, even though there is only one data series?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis start at zero, or do you prefer it to be automatically scaled
  based on the data range?

  9. Would you like to add annotations or markers for significant events during the
  initial years of Google''s stock market presence?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the format or style of the date labels
  on the x-axis?'
