initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing IQ scores across multiple countries. Using
  this data, I want to visualize the IQ distribution for each country. Please create
  a grouped bar chart to compare the average IQ scores between countries (Country_1
  and others if available). Make sure to label the countries and their average IQ
  scores appropriately on the chart. Each bar should represent the average IQ for
  a country. If additional countries exist in the dataset, include them in the chart
  too. The chart should provide a clear comparison of IQ distributions across different
  countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bars representing
  different countries?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to include average IQ scores directly on top of each
  bar?

  3. How detailed do you want the axis labels to be (e.g., full country names, abbreviations)?

  4. Is adding a title to the chart important for you? If so, do you have a preferred
  title?

  5. Do you want a legend in the chart to distinguish the countries, or is it unnecessary
  due to direct labeling?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would prefer the chart to include average IQ scores directly on top of
  each bar.

  3. Full country names.

  4. Yes, adding a title is important. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.'
