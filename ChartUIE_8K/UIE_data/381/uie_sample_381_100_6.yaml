initial_prompt: Please visualize the IQ distribution across different countries using
  a column chart. The data includes countries and corresponding IQ scores with no
  missing values. The chart should display the country names on the x-axis and the
  average IQ values on the y-axis. Make sure each country's average IQ is calculated
  and represented with a separate column for easy comparison. The chart should include
  appropriate labels for the axes and a clear title like "Average IQ by Country".
  Use a color scheme that makes it easy to distinguish each country's column. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the title and axis
  labels?

  2. Would you like the country names on the x-axis to be rotated for better readability?
  If so, at what angle?

  3. Do you have a specific color scheme or palette in mind for the columns?

  4. Should the columns have borders or outlines for differentiation, and if so, what
  color?

  5. Would you like to include data values on top of each column to show the exact
  average IQ numbers?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout for the legend, such as at the top, bottom, left,
  or right of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight with different colors
  or annotations?

  8. Do you have a preference for gridline style and color on the chart background?

  9. Should the chart include a subtitle or any additional text annotations for context?

  10. Do you want to implement any specific sorting order for the countries on the
  x-axis (e.g., alphabetical or by IQ value)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure if rotation is needed. Maybe a slight angle, like 45 degrees?

  3. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  4. I am not sure if columns should have borders.

  5. I think including data values on top of each column would be helpful.

  6. I do not have a preference for the legend layout.

  7. I do not want to highlight any specific countries.

  8. I do not know about the gridline style and color.

  9. I do not think a subtitle or additional annotations are necessary.

  10. Please sort the countries by IQ value.'
