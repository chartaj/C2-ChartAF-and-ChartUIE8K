initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the IQ distribution across three countries.
  The x-axis should represent the different countries, and the y-axis should show
  the IQ scores. Highlight specific data points to emphasize notable IQ values. Use
  text annotations to display the exact IQ scores for the highlighted points. The
  visualization aims to provide insight into how IQ is distributed among the countries,
  focusing attention on certain data points to aid in comparative analysis. Ensure
  the plot is easy to understand for social science research purposes.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different countries\
  \ represented on the x-axis?\n2. How many specific data points would you like to\
  \ highlight, and do you have specific criteria for selecting them?\n3. Do you prefer\
  \ a particular style or font for the text annotations displaying the exact IQ scores?\n\
  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the plot to enhance readability? If so,\
  \ should they be dashed or solid?\n5. Do you have a preferred size for the dots\
  \ representing the IQ scores on the plot?\n6. Is there any additional labeling or\
  \ legend information you would like included in the chart?\n7. Do you have a preference\
  \ for the orientation and position of the x-axis and y-axis labels? \n8. Would you\
  \ like to add a title or subtitle to the plot? If so, do you have specific text\
  \ in mind for these titles?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Three to five data points would be good to highlight. The criteria should be
  the highest, lowest, and median IQ scores if possible.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful. Solid lines would be preferred.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, a title would be helpful. Please use "IQ Distribution Across Three Countries"
