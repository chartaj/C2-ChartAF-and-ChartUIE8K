initial_prompt: Create a box plot diagram to visualize the IQ distribution across
  different countries. Ensure you include text annotations highlighting the average
  IQ per country to help focus attention. Make use of highlights to distinguish countries
  by altering the box colors. The practical purpose of this visualization is to compare
  and contrast the IQ levels between the countries effectively. This helps in understanding
  the social science aspect of IQ distribution. Annotations should help in quickly
  conveying key statistical insights to viewers, aiding in better data interpretation.

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box plot, horizontal or vertical?

  5. Should the countries be ordered in a specific way (e.g., alphabetically or by
  average IQ)?

  6. Do you want a specific title or labels for the axes?

  to enhance the interpretation of the chart?'
