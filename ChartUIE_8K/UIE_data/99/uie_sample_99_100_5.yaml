initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various metrics
  like Suscribers, Visits, Likes, and Comments for the top 1000 YouTube channels.
  Use colors to indicate the intensity of the correlation. For instance, strong positive
  correlations should be in bold colors and weak or negative correlations in lighter
  shades. Make sure to label the axes clearly with the metrics and include a legend
  to explain the color coding. Display countries on the y-axis and metrics on the
  x-axis to explore regional trends. This will help identify patterns and insights
  in YouTube channel performance.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for indicating the intensity\
  \ of the correlation? \n2. Do you prefer categorical colors (for distinct regions)\
  \ or a gradient scale (for correlation strength)?\n3. Are there any specific colors\
  \ you want to avoid in the heatmap?\n4. How would you like the legend to be formatted\
  \ (e.g., specific ranges for color intensity)?\n5. Do you have any preference for\
  \ the order in which countries are displayed on the y-axis (e.g., alphabetical order,\
  \ based on another metric)?\n6. Are there specific countries or metrics you want\
  \ to highlight or emphasize in the heatmap?\n7. Do you have a preference for the\
  \ font size or style for the axis labels and legend to ensure readability?\n8. Are\
  \ there any additional annotations or overlays you would like to include in the\
  \ heatmap?\n9. How detailed do you want the tooltip or hover information to be,\
  \ if applicable?\n10. Would you like grid lines to be present in the heatmap to\
  \ separate the cells clearly?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Gradient scale for correlation strength.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Alphabetical order would be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Ensure readability, but I do not know the specifics.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not need tooltips or hover information.

  10. Yes, include grid lines to separate the cells clearly.'
