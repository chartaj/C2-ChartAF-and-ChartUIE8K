initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between subscribers
  and visits for the top 1000 YouTubers. Highlight YouTubers from the "Música y baile"
  category and annotate the top three YouTubers ("tseries," "MrBeast," and "CoComelon")
  with their subscriber and visit counts. The purpose is to visualize the correlation
  between a YouTuber's subscriber base and video visits, emphasizing key players in
  the entertainment industry. This can help identify trends and standout performers
  in the YouTube landscape.

  scatter plot?

  4. Should we include grid lines, and if so, their style (e.g., dashed, dotted, solid)?

  5. What font and size would you prefer for the annotations of the top YouTubers?

  6. Do you want any specific axis titles or labels on the scatter plot?
