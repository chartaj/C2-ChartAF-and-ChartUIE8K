  subscriber count, highlighting the remarkable differences. Include data-driven text
  annotations to display exact subscriber numbers on top of each bar. This will help
  us understand the scale and popularity across different categories and countries.
  Additionally, use color highlights to distinguish the countries of the YouTubers.
  This chart can serve to inform about the leading figures in the YouTube community,
  their content diversity, and geographic origins.
