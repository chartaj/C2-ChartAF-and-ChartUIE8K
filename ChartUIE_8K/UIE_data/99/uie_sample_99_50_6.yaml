questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include annotations to display the correlation values on the
  cells?

  3. Would you like to cluster the variables to highlight groups with similar correlation
  profiles?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range for the color scale, such as from -1 to 1 for
  correlation values?

  5. Should we include a color bar to indicate the range of correlation values?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels, such as font size or orientation?

  7. Would you like to highlight the diagonal cells of the heatmap where variables
  correlate with themselves?

  8. Should the heatmap grid lines be visible or hidden?

  9. Do you require a particular aspect ratio for the heatmap (e.g., square cells)?'
