initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualization of the "Suscribers" column
  from the Top 1000 Youtubers statistics data. I want to see how the subscriber counts
  are distributed across these top channels. Make sure to include appropriate labels
  and a title for the histogram to indicate that it is showing the distribution of
  Youtuber subscriber counts. If possible, color-code the histogram bars to enhance
  readability and visual appeal. This will help me better understand the range and
  frequency of subscriber counts among these popular channels. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include a legend for any additional information in the histogram?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  5. Do you want to include any specific annotations or markers to highlight particular
  sections of the histogram?'
