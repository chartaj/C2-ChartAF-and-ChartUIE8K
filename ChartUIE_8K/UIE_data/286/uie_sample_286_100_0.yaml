initial_prompt: '<start of instruction>

  Create a bubble chart to visualize key features from the breast cancer dataset.
  Use ''radius_mean'' and ''texture_mean'' for the X and Y axes. The bubble size should
  represent ''area_mean'', and the color should differentiate between ''M'' (Malignant)
  and ''B'' (Benign) diagnoses. Add text annotations to highlight the largest and
  smallest bubbles. This will help emphasize variations in tumor characteristics and
  diagnose focus areas. Add highlights to the ''radius_mean'' for easy distinction.
  Ensure the chart is clear for healthcare professionals to analyze tumor data effectively.

questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to differentiate
  between ''M'' (Malignant) and ''B'' (Benign) diagnoses?

  2. What size range would you prefer for the bubbles to ensure they are visually
  distinct?

  3. Do you have any specific fonts or styles for the text annotations highlighting
  the largest and smallest bubbles?

  4. How would you like the highlights on ''radius_mean'' to be represented? (e.g.,
  specific markers, additional color coding)

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like added to the axes or the
  chart overall?

  6. Do you have preferences for the layout of the legend explaining the color coding
  for diagnoses?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure about the color palette; something that makes the difference clear
  would be great.

  2. I do not know the size range, but they should be distinct enough to see variations.

  3. I do not have any specific fonts or styles for the text annotations.

  4. Specific markers to highlight ''radius_mean'' would be helpful.

  5. Yes, please add informative labels for the axes and a clear title for the chart.

  6. I have no specific preference for the layout of the legend.
