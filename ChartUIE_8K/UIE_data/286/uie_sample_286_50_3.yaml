initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of 'radius_mean' for benign
  and malignant tumors, using data from the Breast Cancer dataset. Make sure to distinguish
  between the two diagnosis categories with different colors. This will help in visualizing
  the spread and central tendency of the tumor sizes.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the benign and malignant
  categories?

  2. What bin size or number of bins do you prefer for the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles for the axes and the
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the histogram (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, scientific)?

  5. Should any statistical measures (like mean, median) be annotated on the histogram?'
