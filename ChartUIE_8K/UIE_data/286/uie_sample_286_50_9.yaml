initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between the different
  numerical features (like radius_mean, texture_mean, area_mean, etc.) in the breast
  cancer dataset to identify strong relationships among variables.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include annotations displaying the correlation values?

  3. Do you have a preferred range for the correlation values (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  4. Would you like a specific correlation method to be used (e.g., Pearson, Spearman)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific ordering or clustering of the features in the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific labels or headers you would like to include on the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a specific size or aspect ratio in mind for the heatmap?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included in the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the font type and size used in the heatmap?

  11. Do you want to highlight specific ranges of correlation values with distinct
  colors?

  12. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like for the heatmap?'
