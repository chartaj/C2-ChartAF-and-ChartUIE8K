initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the mean texture values ('texture_mean')
  for different patients categorized by their diagnosis ('diagnosis'), either 'M'
  for malignant or 'B' for benign. Ensure each bar represents an individual patient's
  mean texture value, and use different colors to distinguish between malignant and
  benign cases. Additionally, include labels and a legend for clarity. This will help
  in comparing the texture characteristics of cancerous and non-cancerous diagnoses
  efficiently. Ensure the chart is easy to read, informative, and appropriately represents
  the health data context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between malignant
  and benign cases?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., ascending,
  descending)?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like to include any additional annotations or reference lines in the
  chart?

  5. Do you want to display the exact mean texture values on top of each bar?

  6. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels (e.g., specific wording, font
  size)?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?

  9. Would you like to include a grid to facilitate reading the values?

  10. Do you have any preference for the layout of the legend within the chart?'
