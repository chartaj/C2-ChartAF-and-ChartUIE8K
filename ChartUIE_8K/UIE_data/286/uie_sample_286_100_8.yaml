initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'radius_mean'
  and 'texture_mean' for different 'diagnosis' categories in the breast cancer dataset.
  The chart should help in comparing these metrics between malignant (M) and benign
  (B) diagnoses. This will provide insights into how these features vary between different
  diagnoses, aiding in the identification of patterns. Ensure the chart is clear and
  labels are properly annotated for easy interpretation of results.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  2. Are there any particular colors you would like to use for the malign (M) and
  benign (B) categories?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the variables (e.g., ''radius_mean'' and ''texture_mean'')
  on the x-axis?

  4. Would you like to display any additional statistical information (e.g., mean,
  median) on the box chart?

  5. How detailed should the axis labels be? Would you prefer short labels or more
  descriptive ones?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be included for better readability?

  7. Would you prefer the chart to be in a specific orientation (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include on
  the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred font style or font size for the labels and title?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I am not sure, maybe "Distribution of Radius_mean and Texture_mean by Diagnosis"?

  2. I am not sure, use what you think is best.

  3. I do not know, no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please display the mean and median.

  5. More descriptive labels would be appreciated.

  6. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  7. Vertical orientation is fine.

  8. No, I don''t think any additional information is necessary.

  9. I do not have a specific preference on font style or size.
