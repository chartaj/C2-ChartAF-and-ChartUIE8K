initial_prompt: Visualize the breast cancer data in a bubble chart showing radius_mean,
  texture_mean, and perimeter_mean. Use text annotations for outliers and highlights
  for significant data clusters. This will help identify patterns and anomalies in
  the health dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the bubble chart and highlights?

  2. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Is there a specific threshold or criteria you would like to use to identify outliers?

  4. Would you like to add a legend explaining the significance of the data clusters
  and outliers?

  5. Do you have a specific title or labels for the axes you would like to use?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or a background pattern in the chart?

  7. How would you prefer the data clusters to be highlighted (e.g., different colors,
  larger bubbles, or specific shapes)?

  8. Is there a specific order or range for the data that you would like to focus
  on or filter out in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I don''t have a specific threshold in mind.

  4. Yes, please add a legend explaining the significance of the data clusters and
  outliers.

  5. I would like the title to be "Breast Cancer Data Visualization" and axis labels
  to be "Radius Mean", "Texture Mean", and "Perimeter Mean".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would prefer the data clusters to be highlighted with different colors.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
