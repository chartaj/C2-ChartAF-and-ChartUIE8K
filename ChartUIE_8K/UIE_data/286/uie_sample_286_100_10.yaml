initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the "radius_mean" against "texture_mean"
  from the Breast Cancer dataset. Color-code the points based on the "diagnosis" column
  to differentiate between malignant (M) and benign (B) cases. Include axis labels
  and a legend to help interpret the chart. This will help in understanding how these
  two features differ across the diagnosis categories in the context of breast cancer.
  Can you also add trend lines for both categories to better visualize any correlation
  between these features? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate
  between malignant and benign cases?

  2. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the trend lines (e.g., solid,
  dashed)?

  3. Would you like the scatter plot to have a particular background color or grid
  style?

  4. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Do you prefer any specific markers for the scatter plot points (e.g., circles,
  squares)?

  6. Should the trend lines be linear or would you prefer another type of fitting
  method (e.g., polynomial)?

  7. Is there a specific range you want to set for the axes limits, or should it be
  auto-scaled based on the data?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. No specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Linear trend lines would be good.

  7. Auto-scaled based on the data would be fine.'
