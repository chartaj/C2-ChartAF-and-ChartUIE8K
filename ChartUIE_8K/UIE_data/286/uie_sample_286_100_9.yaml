initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the relationships between different
  features in the breast cancer dataset. The features include measurements like radius,
  texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. Use color intensity to indicate
  the strength of the correlation between these features. The goal is to identify
  patterns and significant correlations that could help understand the factors associated
  with breast cancer diagnosis. Ensure the heatmap is clearly labeled and easy to
  interpret for medical professionals and researchers involved in breast cancer analysis.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer a specific range of colors to represent low and high correlations?

  3. Should negative correlations be highlighted differently from positive correlations?

  4. Do you have a preferred color for the background of the heatmap?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like to include annotations that show the exact correlation values
  on the heatmap?

  7. Is there a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap that would be most
  useful for your audience?

  8. Do you have a preference for how the heatmap should handle missing values, if
  any?

  9. Are there any specific features you want to be emphasized or highlighted in the
  heatmap?

  10. Would you like to include gridlines or borders within the cells of the heatmap
  for better separation of values?'
