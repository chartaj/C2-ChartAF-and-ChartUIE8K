initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the population of countries
  using the provided data. Highlight countries with the largest and smallest populations.
  Add text annotations for these highlighted countries to show their names and population
  values, drawing attention to them. The purpose is to focus on population distribution
  globally. Use color gradients to indicate population density, with a legend for
  clarity. This is for a social science project examining global population trends.
  Ensure the visualization is clear and engaging, helping viewers understand where
  populations are most and least dense.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred color gradients for indicating population density?

  2. What color do you prefer for highlighting the countries with the largest and
  smallest populations?

  3. Do you have a specific font and size preference for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like to include any specific geographic regions or focus areas on the
  map?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to see on the map
  besides country names and population values?

  6. Do you have a particular map projection preference?

  7. Would you like the legend to be placed in a specific location on the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have any specific focus areas; a global map is fine.

  5. No additional annotations are needed besides country names and population values.

  6. I do not have a particular map projection preference.

  7. I do not know.'
