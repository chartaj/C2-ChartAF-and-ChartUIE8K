initial_prompt: Create a bar chart depicting the population of different countries.
  Highlight the top 3 most populous countries to make them stand out. Use data annotations
  to display the exact population figures on the bars for these top 3 countries to
  focus the viewer's attention. The purpose of this visualization is to understand
  the population distribution across various countries. Add text annotations to provide
  context and explain any notable trends. Ensure that the data is easy to read and
