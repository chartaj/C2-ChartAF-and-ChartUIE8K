  Highlight the top 3 most populous countries to make them stand out. Use data annotations
  to display the exact population figures on the bars for these top 3 countries to
  focus the viewer's attention. The purpose of this visualization is to understand
  the population distribution across various countries. Add text annotations to provide

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
