initial_prompt: Hey, could you create a heatmap using the population data of various
  countries? The dataset has the country names, their codes, and their populations.
  Please make sure to highlight the population differences across the countries, so
  it's easy to identify which ones are more or less populated. Use color gradients
  where darker colors represent higher populations and lighter colors represent lower
  populations. I want this to be visually appealing and easy to understand, as it's
  for a social science presentation. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  to use for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include country codes along with the country names on the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the country names and population
  numbers?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to have a legend explaining the color gradient used?

  5. How would you prefer the countries to be ordered on the heatmap (e.g., alphabetically,
  by population size, or by geographic region)?

  6. Do you want to include any specific labels or annotations on the heatmap to highlight
  particular countries or population thresholds?

  7. Should the heatmap have any boundary lines to separate the countries visually?

  8. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the heatmap? If so, what should
  they say?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include country codes along with the country names on the
  heatmap.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  4. Yes, I would like the heatmap to have a legend explaining the color gradient
  used.

  5. By population size would be preferred.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, it would be good to have boundary lines to separate the countries visually.

  8. Yes, please add a title. The title should be "Global Population Heatmap."'
