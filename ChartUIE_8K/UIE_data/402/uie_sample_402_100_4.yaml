initial_prompt: I have a dataset that provides population information for different
  countries including their names, codes, and population counts. I need a choropleth
  map to visualize this data, showing country population sizes with varying color
  intensities. The countries should be color-coded based on their population, with
  darker shades representing higher populations and lighter shades indicating lower
  populations. Also, ensure the map includes a legend to denote the population ranges
  corresponding with the colors. This will help in easily identifying which countries
  have larger or smaller populations. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you prefer any specific range or thresholds for the population values in
  the legend?

  3. Are there any particular geographical regions you want to highlight or emphasize?

  4. Do you want the country names to be displayed directly on the map?

  5. Should the map include borders or boundaries for countries for better visual
  separation?

  6. Are there any reference lines or markers you would like added to the map?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference for geographical regions.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, the map should include borders or boundaries for countries.

  6. I am not sure.'
