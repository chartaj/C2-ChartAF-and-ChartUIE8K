initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Rolling Stone Album Rankings
  data. Plot "release_year" on the x-axis and "rank_2020" on the y-axis to visualize
  how album rankings have changed over time. Annotate significant data points, such
  as high-ranking albums, with their "clean_name" and "rank_2020". Highlight albums
  from the "Rock n' Roll/Rhythm & Blues" genre for emphasis. The chart should help
  identify trends and the influence of specific genres across different years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different genres,
  particularly for highlighting the "Rock n'' Roll/Rhythm & Blues" genre?

  2. What threshold do you consider for an album to be labeled as ''high-ranking''
  for annotation purposes?

  3. Do you prefer a title for the chart? If so, please provide the preferred title.

  4. Would you like to include axis labels, grid lines, or background color customization?

  5. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the annotations and axis
  labels?

  6. Should there be a legend to differentiate genres or highlighted data points?

  7. Do you prefer the data points to be circles, squares, or another shape for better
  visualization?'

  2. High-ranking could be within the top 20, I think.

  4. Yes, please include axis labels and grid lines. I am not sure about the background
  color.
