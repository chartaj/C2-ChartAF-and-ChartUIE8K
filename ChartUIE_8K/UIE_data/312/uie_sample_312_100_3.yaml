initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the Rolling Stone Album Rankings dataset.
  Plot the 'sort_name' on the x-axis and 'differential' on the y-axis. This visualization
  will help us see how rankings have changed for different artists over the years.
  Make sure the bars are color-coded based on the 'genre'. Also, add a legend for
  the genres and label each bar with the 'clean_name' for clarity. This chart will
  help us quickly understand which artists' rankings have improved or declined the
  most over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the genres?

  2. How would you like the bars to be labeled with the ''clean_name'' (e.g., at the
  top of the bar, inside the bar, etc.)?

  3. What font type and size would you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the x-axis labels (artist names) be displayed at a specific angle (e.g.,
  horizontal, 45 degrees)?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, in what color and style?

  6. Do you have a specific title for the bar chart, and would you prefer any subtitle?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines for the chart background color?

  9. Do you prefer the bars to have any specific width or spacing between them?

  10. Would you like to highlight specific artists or genres in the chart with distinct
  colors or styles?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette; any visually distinct colors work.

  2. Label the bars at the top with the ''clean_name''.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for font type and size.

  4. The x-axis labels can be displayed at a 45-degree angle.

  5. I am not sure about gridlines.

  6. No specific title or subtitle is necessary.

  7. Place the legend at the bottom.

  8. I do not have specific guidelines for the background color.

  9. I do not have a preference for bar width or spacing.
