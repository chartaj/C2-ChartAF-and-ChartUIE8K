initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of differential rankings
  for albums between 2003, 2012, and 2020 from the Rolling Stone Album Rankings dataset.
  The chart should display the range, median, and any outliers of differentials for
  these years. Label the x-axis with 'Year', using 2003, 2012, and 2020 as categories,
  and the y-axis with 'Differential in Rankings'. Include a title to indicate the
  comparison of album rank changes over the years. This will help us understand how
  album rankings have shifted over time.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the box chart?\n2. Would\
  \ you like specific annotations on any of the data points?\n3. Should the chart\
  \ include gridlines for better readability?\n4. Do you prefer any specific font\
  \ style or size for the labels and title?\n5. Do you need a legend to explain any\
  \ specific elements of the chart?\n6. Is there a specific width or height you prefer\
  \ for the box chart?\n7. Would you like any additional statistical details displayed\
  \ on the chart, such as quartiles or mean values? \n8. Is there any specific ordering\
  \ of the years (2003, 2012, 2020) you prefer on the x-axis?\n9. Are there any specific\
  \ outliers you want to highlight or annotate?\n10. Do you prefer a particular software\
  \ or tool for creating the visualization (e.g., Matplotlib, Tableau)?"
