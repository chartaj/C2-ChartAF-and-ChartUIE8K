initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the Rolling Stone Album Rankings dataset.
  I want to see the distribution of album release years. This histogram should have
  the x-axis representing the release years and the y-axis showing the number of albums
  released in those years. Make sure to include appropriate axis labels and a title
  for clarity. Also, color the bars to make them visually appealing. Thank you!

  2. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the histogram? If so, do you have a specific
  style in mind?

  6. Do you prefer a specific bin width or number of bins for the histogram?'
