initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart showing students' grades (James, Michael,
  Elizabeth, Paul, Ashley) over the months. Highlight Elizabeth's and Michael's grades
  since they're top performers. Include text annotations for their grades in March.
  This chart will help visualize the monthly performance trends for each student throughout
  the year and identify patterns or areas needing improvement. Ensure that the colors
  are distinct for each student and the months clearly labeled. The chart should emphasize
  differences among students and across time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used for
  each student?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  3. Should we include a legend to indicate which bar color corresponds to which student?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for text annotations (e.g., font size, color,
  format)?

  5. Are there specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the axis labels
  and chart title?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the bar heights?

  7. Should the bar chart be displayed in a specific orientation (e.g., vertical or
  horizontal)?

  8. Are there any specific months or ranges that need to be emphasized or highlighted
  besides March?

  9. Would you like to display data values at the top of each bar for better readability?

  10. Do you have any preference for the range of the y-axis based on the students''
  grades?

  11. Would you like the chart to include tooltips or hover information for additional
  details?

  12. Is there a specific format or styling you prefer for distinguishing highlighted
  grades of Elizabeth and Michael?'
