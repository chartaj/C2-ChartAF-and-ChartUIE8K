initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot that visualizes the students' grades
  over the year. I want each student's performance (James, Michael, Elizabeth, Paul,
  Ashley) to be represented with different markers and colors. The x-axis should be
  the months (1 to 12) and the y-axis should be the grades. Make sure to include a
  legend to identify each student. Overall, the scatter plot should help us easily
  compare how each student's grades have varied throughout the year. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different students?

  2. Do you have specific marker shapes you would like to use for each student?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines on the scatter plot?

  4. Do you want specific axis labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  6. Do you want the chart to include a title or subtitle? If so, please provide the
  wording.

  7. Should the chart background be a specific color or transparent?

  8. Do you want to add any annotations or notes on specific data points?

  9. Do you prefer the markers to be connected with lines to show the trends more
  clearly?

  10. Are there any specific stylistic elements you wish to include in the legend?'
