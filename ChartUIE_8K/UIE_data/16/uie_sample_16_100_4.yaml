initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart that visualizes the stats of the Pokémon.
  The x-axis should represent the Pokémon''s "#", and the y-axis should represent
  their ''Total'' stats. Each line in the chart should represent a different stat
  category: ''HP'', ''Attack'', ''Defense'', ''Sp. Atk'', ''Sp. Def'', and ''Speed''.

  you use different colors for each stat category line for clarity. Include proper
  labels and a legend for the chart. Thank you!'
