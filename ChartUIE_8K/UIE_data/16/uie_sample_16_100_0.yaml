initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the total stats of the Pokemon, categorized
  by their primary types. Highlight the top 3 Pokemon with the highest total stats
  in each type category. Add text annotations showing their total stats to emphasize
  their prominence. The aim is to identify which Pokemon excel within their primary
  types, making comparisons straightforward. The chart should also indicate the types
  that generally have the highest stats overall. The context is for people interested
  in seeing how Pokemon types stack up in terms of their overall strength.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  differentiating the various Pokemon types?

  2. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations
  showing the total stats?

  3. Would you like to include any titles or labels for the chart, axes, and legend?
  If so, please specify.

  4. Do you want the chart to display gridlines or any other background elements to
  aid in comparison?

  5. Should the chart have a specific order for displaying the types (e.g., alphabetical,
  by average total stats)?

  6. Are there any specific design elements (e.g., borders around bars, shadows) you
  would like to include or avoid?

  7. Would you like to add a legend to the chart to explain the highlighted top 3
  Pokemon in each type category?

  8. Do you need any additional annotations or markers on the chart, such as the average
  total stats per type?

  9. What dimensions (width and height) do you prefer for the chart to ensure clarity
  and readability?'
