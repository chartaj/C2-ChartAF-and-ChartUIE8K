initial_prompt: Hi, Iâ€™d like a Pie chart based on the data provided about Pokemon
  stats. Specifically, I want the chart to show the distribution of different primary
  types (Type 1) of Pokemon. Each slice of the Pie chart should represent a different
  primary type, demonstrating how frequently each type appears in the dataset. This
  will help me visually understand the commonality of each primary Pokemon type. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different slices of the pie
  chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include labels with percentage values or frequencies
  for each type?

  3. Is there a specific order in which you would like the slices to be arranged (e.g.,
  ascending/descending by frequency)?

  4. Do you want a legend accompanying the chart to display the types and their corresponding
  colors?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to have a title? If yes, please specify the title.

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  title?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s overall layout (e.g., a 3D pie chart)?

  8. Would you like to highlight or emphasize any particular type in the chart?'
