initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the given Pokémon data. The box chart
  should visualize the distribution of 'Total', 'HP', 'Attack', 'Defense', 'Sp. Atk',
  'Sp. Def', and 'Speed' for each 'Generation'. This will help to compare the spread
  and central tendencies of these stats across different generations of Pokémon. Ensure
  that each generation is a separate category on the x-axis, and each box represents
  one of the seven stats mentioned above on the y-axis. The chart should be clear
  and include appropriate labels for better understanding. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different generations
  or stats?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Should outliers be highlighted in the box plots?

  4. Do you prefer a specific order for the stats to be displayed on the y-axis?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to include on the
  chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the labels and title?

  7. Should the chart include a legend explaining the different stats?'
