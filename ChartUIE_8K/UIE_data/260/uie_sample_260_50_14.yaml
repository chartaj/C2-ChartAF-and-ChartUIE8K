initial_prompt: Create a Connected Scatter Plot using the 'pl_orbper' and 'pl_orbsmax'
  data from the Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries dataset. Each point should
  represent an exoplanet, with lines connecting points discovered by the same method
  'pl_discmethod'.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating the discovery
  methods?

  2. Should the lines connecting exoplanets discovered by the same method have different
  styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for better distinction?

  3. Do you prefer specific shapes for the scatter plot points to represent different
  discovery methods?

  4. What level of axis smoothing or scaling (e.g., logarithmic, linear) would you
  prefer for ''pl_orbper'' and ''pl_orbsmax''?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  6. Should there be annotations on the chart for specific exoplanets of interest?

  7. Do you require a legend to clearly identify the different discovery methods used?

  8. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  9. Should the chart include axis titles for ''pl_orbper'' and ''pl_orbsmax'' with
  specific descriptions?

  10. Would you like to highlight any specific range or value on the chart for ''pl_orbper''
  or ''pl_orbsmax''?'
