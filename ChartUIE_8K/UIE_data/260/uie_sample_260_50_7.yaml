initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the distribution of exoplanet
  discoveries by their host star's right ascension (ra) and declination (dec) coordinates
  from the Kepler Telescope exoplanet dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Choropleth map (e.g.,
  sequential, diverging, or qualitative colors)?

  2. What range of data values would you like the color scale to represent? Should
  it be based on the number of discoveries or normalized in some way?

  3. Do you have a preferred geographic projection for the map?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the map?

  5. Should the map include a legend to indicate the color scale and its corresponding
  data values?

  6. Are there any particular regions or coordinates you want to highlight on the
  map?

  7. Would you prefer to see the data presented with a certain level of detail (e.g.,
  aggregated to specific celestial regions)?

  8. Do you want to overlay any additional data points or markers that provide context
  to the distributions?

  9. Should the map include grid lines for right ascension and declination?

  10. Is there a preferred orientation for the map (e.g., North at the top, South
  at the top)?'
