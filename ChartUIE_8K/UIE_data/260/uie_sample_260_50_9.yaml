initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of the orbital periods
  (pl_orbper) of exoplanets discovered by the Kepler Telescope. Include error margins
  (pl_orbpererr1, pl_orbpererr2) as whiskers. Highlight the central tendency and outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have a color preference for highlighting the central tendency
  and outliers?

  2. Would you like to label the outliers with specific data points or identifiers?

  3. Do you prefer specific axis labels or titles for the chart?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the error margins and central tendency?

  5. Do you have a preferred scale (linear or logarithmic) for the y-axis representing
  the orbital periods?

  6. Would you like to include a grid in the background of the chart?

  7. Is there a particular font preference for the text elements in the chart?

  8. Should the chart include any annotations or notes to provide additional context?

  9. Do you have any specific width and height dimensions for the chart?

  10. Would you prefer specific interval ranges for the y-axis to make the chart easier
  to read?'
