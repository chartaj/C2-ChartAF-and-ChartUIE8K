initial_prompt: I want a Bubble chart visualizing exoplanet discoveries using Kepler
  Telescope data. X-axis should be 'ra' (right ascension), and Y-axis should be 'dec'
  (declination). The bubble size should reflect 'pl_bmassj' (planet mass in Jupiter
  masses). Additionally, color the bubbles based on 'st_teff' (star effective temperature).
  Please ensure that the chart also has a legend indicating the temperature scale
  and axis titles for clarity. This chart should help understand the spatial distribution
  of exoplanets in relation to their host star's properties. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the temperature scale?

  2. Would you like any specific markers or symbols for the bubbles?

  3. Should the bubble size have a specific range or scale?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis titles and labels?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better reference, and if so, should
  they be styled in any particular way?

  6. Do you want any annotations or data labels on the bubbles themselves?

  7. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any specific background or border style for the chart?

  9. Should the chart include titles or subtitles? If so, what should the title/subtitle
  be?

  10. Do you want any specific zoom level or focus area by default for the chart?'
