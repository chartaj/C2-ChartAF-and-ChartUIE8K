initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of "pl_orbper"
  (Orbital Period) and "pl_orbsmax" (Orbital Semi-Major Axis) for different exoplanets
  discovered by the Kepler Telescope. Use "pl_discmethod" (Discovery Method) to categorize
  the data. Represent different discovery methods with distinct colors for clarity.
  Ensure the plot highlights the density of data points across the range for each
  category. Also, include appropriate axis labels, a title, and a legend for easy
  interpretation. This will help in comparing different discovery methods based on
  orbital periods and semi-major axes distributions.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for representing different discovery
  methods?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style of the violin plot (e.g., smooth vs. jagged
  edges)?

  3. Would you like any specific range limits for the axes?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font or style for the axis labels, title, and legend?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  plot?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Should the plot display grid lines, or would you prefer a plain background?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart, or should it be a generic
  title like ''Distribution of Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes by Discovery Method''?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. I am not sure, please use a range that best represents the data.

  4. I do not know.

  5. No specific labels or annotations needed.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. A plain background would be fine.

  8. A generic title like ''Distribution of Orbital Periods and Semi-Major Axes by
  Discovery Method'' is good.'
