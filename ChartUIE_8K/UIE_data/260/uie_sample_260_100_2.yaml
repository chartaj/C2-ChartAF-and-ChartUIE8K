initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries.
  Plot 'ra' (Right Ascension) on the x-axis and 'dec' (Declination) on the y-axis
  to represent the 3 detected exoplanets. Annotate each point with 'pl_hostname' to
  highlight specific stars hosting planets. Highlight points based on the 'pl_pnum'
  to distinguish between stars with different numbers of planets. Include 'pl_letter'
  as text annotations to indicate different planets around the same star, if multiple
  exist. This visualization aims to illustrate the spatial distribution and discovery
  methods of Kepler Telescope findings.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to highlight
  points based on the ''pl_pnum'' attribute?

  2. Is there a specific shape or marker type you prefer for the scatter plot points?

  3. How would you prefer the annotations for ''pl_hostname'' to be displayed (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the text annotations for ''pl_letter'' (e.g., font
  size, positioning relative to the points)?

  5. Is there a specific title or labels you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Do you prefer the background of the plot to be a specific color or style (e.g.,
  grid lines, no grid lines)?

  7. How would you like legends to be displayed (if required to distinguish multiple
  planets around the same star)?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the overall layout or size of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer the font size for ''pl_hostname'' annotations to be readable but
  not too large; maybe a medium size in a dark color like black or navy blue.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. The x-axis label should be ''Right Ascension'' and the y-axis label should be
  ''Declination''.

  6. I prefer the background to have grid lines for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have specific requirements for the overall layout or size of the chart.'
