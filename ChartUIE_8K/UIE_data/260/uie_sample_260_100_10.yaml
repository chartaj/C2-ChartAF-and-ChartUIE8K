initial_prompt: Create a donut chart showing the proportion of different planet discovery
  methods from the Kepler Telescope Exoplanet Discoveries dataset. The chart should
  segment the discoveries by the 'pl_discmethod' field. Each segment represents a
  discovery method, with the size of the segment corresponding to the number of planets
  discovered by each method. The chart should highlight key discovery methods like
  'Radial Velocity' and 'Transit'. Use contrasting colors for each segment for clearer
  differentiation. Include a legend explaining each color and segment. Use the latest
  available data for accuracy.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the different segments?

  2. What colors would you like to use to highlight ''Radial Velocity'' and ''Transit''
  methods?

  3. Do you prefer any particular order for displaying the discovery methods in the
  legend?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart?

  7. Are there any particular requirements for the chart''s size or aspect ratio?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific color preferences for the different segments.

  2. I am not sure, just use contrasting colors to highlight ''Radial Velocity'' and
  ''Transit''.

  3. I have no specific preference for the order of displaying the discovery methods
  in the legend.

  4. I do not know, standard font styles and sizes should be fine.

  5. “Proportion of Kepler Exoplanet Discoveries by Method”

  6. No specific annotations or notes are needed.

  7. No particular requirements for the chart''s size or aspect ratio.'
