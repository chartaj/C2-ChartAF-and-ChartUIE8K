initial_prompt: Create a Box chart to visualize the distribution of the stellar distances
  (st_dist) of planets discovered by the Kepler Telescope. The chart should display
  the interquartile range, median, and potential outliers of the distances. Highlight
  any significant variability or outliers to demonstrate the spread of stellar distances.
  This visualization will provide insights into the typical range and extraordinary
  values, aiding in understanding the diversity of stars hosting exoplanets. Ensure
  that axis labels, units of measurement, and a title are clearly defined to improve
  readability and context.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme or style of the box
  chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  3. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the title, axis labels, and
  units of measurement?

  4. Should the chart have specific annotations highlighting significant outliers
  or variability?

  5. Do you want to include a legend or any other descriptive text in the chart?

  6. Are there specific formats for the title, axis labels, or any other text elements
  that you prefer?

  7. Would you like to set a custom range for the y-axis to focus on a specific range
  of stellar distances?

  8. Do you prefer the box plots to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  9. Should the whiskers of the box plot represent the full data range or a specific
  percentile range?'
