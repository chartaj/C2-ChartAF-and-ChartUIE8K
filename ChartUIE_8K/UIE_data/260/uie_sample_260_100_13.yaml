initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the orbital period ('pl_orbper')
  of the exoplanets discovered by the Kepler Telescope over time. On the x-axis, plot
  the 'rowupdate' dates, and on the y-axis, plot the 'pl_orbper' values. Make sure
  to include data points for each entry and connect them with lines. Highlight notable
  discoveries or anomalies with different colors or markers. The chart should provide
  a clear trend line showing the progression of orbital period discoveries made by
  Kepler. Ensure axis labels are readable, and include a legend if multiple data sets
  or categories are depicted.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the title of the chart?

  2. What specific colors would you like for highlighting notable discoveries or anomalies?

  3. Do you want any specific markers for notable anomalies? If yes, please specify.

  4. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the x-axis?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines in the chart? If yes, should they be both horizontal
  and vertical?

  6. Should the trend line be smoothed (e.g., a moving average) or raw (connecting
  each data point directly)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the line style or thickness?

  8. Would you like to display data point values or tooltips when hovering over data
  points?

  9. Should we include labels or annotations for notable discoveries directly on the
  chart?

  10. If there are missing values in the data, do you prefer to interpolate these
  points or leave gaps in the line?'
