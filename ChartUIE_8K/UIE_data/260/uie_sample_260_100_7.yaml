initial_prompt: I’d like to visualize the exoplanet discoveries data via a Choropleth
  map showing the density of discovered exoplanets per star mass in different regions
  of the sky. Utilize the 'ra' and 'dec' coordinates for the map's spatial aspect.
  Highlight areas with dense discoveries in darker shades. Include a color legend
  to easily interpret the density levels. The map should be interactive, allowing
  zoom and hover-over details for specific star masses and exoplanet counts. Ensure
  it’s user-friendly for both amateur astronomers and the general public interested
  in Kepler Telescope discoveries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Choropleth map?

  2. What level of granularity do you prefer for the density shading?

  3. Would you like labels for specific points or regions on the map?

  4. Do you have a specific scale or unit preference for star mass?

  5. Should the color legend be placed at a particular position on the map?

  6. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, equirectangular)?

  7. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the map?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the legend and labels?

  9. Should there be specific thresholds for highlighting different density levels?

  10. Are there any additional details you want to include in the hover-over tooltips?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer a medium level of granularity for the density shading.

  3. Yes, labels for specific points or regions on the map would be good.

  4. I do not have a specific scale or unit preference for star mass.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Include star mass and exoplanet counts in the hover-over tooltips.'
