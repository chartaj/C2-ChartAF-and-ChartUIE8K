initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualization of exoplanet discoveries by the Kepler
  Telescope. Use the columns 'pl_hostname' and 'pl_discmethod' to differentiate the
  exoplanets and their discovery methods. Highlight discoveries with rare methods
  to draw user attention. Add text annotations for notable discoveries to give context.
  Aim to show patterns in discovery methods and correlate with planet hostnames. This
  will help identify any common traits or unique findings among the exoplanets detected.
  Also, include color coding to represent the number of planets discovered by each
  method to emphasize trends and outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a gradient scale or discrete colors for different discovery
  methods?

  3. How would you like the rare methods to be highlighted (e.g., bold colors, borders)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the annotations include detailed information or just notable discovery
  names?

  6. Do you have a preference for the ordering of hostnames and discovery methods
  on the axes?

  7. Would you like the heatmap to include gridlines or be gridline-free?

  8. Would you like to customize the title and axis labels for clarity?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding?

  10. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., square, rectangular, aspect
  ratio)?'
