02_initial_prompt: Visualize park scores in San Francisco using a heatmap that highlights
  parks by score and facility type. Include annotations for top-scoring parks to draw
  attention to high-quality facilities. Use color variations to emphasize park scores,
  and text annotations for key data points, noting their names and locations. Aim
  for clear representation of both park quality and geographical distribution to aid
  in real-estate decisions. Include a legend for score interpretation and ensure clear
  labeling of facilities and PQ scores. Highlight outliers and ensure the map is user-friendly
  for quick insights on park quality across the city.
