initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing San Francisco Park Scores.
  Each bar represents a different park (use the 'Park' column), and the stacks within
  each bar represent the various 'Facility Types' at that park. The height of each
  stack should correlate to the 'Score' associated with each facility type. Group
  the data by 'PSA' regions to compare the scores across different regions. The chart
  should be clearly labeled with axes, a legend for the facility types, and different
  colors for the stacks.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the colors used for the different facility
  types?

  2. Are there any specific parks or PSA regions you would like to highlight?

  3. Do you prefer the scores to be displayed as labels on top of each stack in the
  bar charts?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the chart for easier
  comparison?

  5. Do you want any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  6. Should the chart include a title? If yes, do you have a specific title in mind?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or notes you want to include on the chart?'
