initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the average park scores for
  different facility types in San Francisco parks. The x-axis should display the various
  facility types, and the y-axis should show the average score for each type. Use
  data from the given CSV file, including information such as the ParkID, PSA, Park,

  will help illustrate which facility types consistently score higher in park evaluations.
