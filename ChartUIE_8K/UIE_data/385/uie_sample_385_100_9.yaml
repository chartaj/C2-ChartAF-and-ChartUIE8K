initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart that visualizes military expenditure by country
  and continent. Each bubble should represent a country, with the size of the bubble
  showing the military expenditure in million USD. The chart should also differentiate
  bubbles by continent, possibly using different colors for each continent like North
  America, Europe, etc. The y-axis can display the military expenditure, while the
  x-axis represents the countries. Please ensure the chart is easy to understand and
  includes a legend explaining the colors for each continent. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the different continents?

  2. Would you like to display the exact military expenditure value within or next
  to each bubble?

  3. Do you have a preference for the format or style of the chart legend?

  4. Should the countries be sorted in a specific order on the x-axis, such as alphabetically
  or by military expenditure?

  5. Are there any specific countries or continents you want to highlight or emphasize
  in the chart?

  6. Would you prefer a specific font or style for the labels and legends on the chart?

  7. Is there a maximum or minimum size you would like the bubbles to be?'
