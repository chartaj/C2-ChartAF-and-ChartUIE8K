  Please create a heatmap where the x-axis represents the countries and the y-axis
  represents the continents. The color intensity should reflect the military expenditure,
  with higher values showing darker colors. This way, I can easily compare the spending
  across different regions and countries. Make sure the heatmap is clear and labels
  are readable. Thanks!
