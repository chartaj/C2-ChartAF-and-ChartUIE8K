  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between
  continents?

  2. Do you want the bubble sizes to be proportional to the exact expenditure amounts,
  or would you prefer a logarithmic scale for better visual differentiation?

  3. Are there any specific annotation requirements, such as displaying country names
  or exact expenditure amounts on the bubbles?

  4. Is there a preferred order for listing or displaying the continents in the legend?

  5. Do you prefer any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  6. Would you like gridlines or background shading for better readability of the
