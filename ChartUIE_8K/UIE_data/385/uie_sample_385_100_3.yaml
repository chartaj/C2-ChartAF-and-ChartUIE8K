initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualization to show the military expenditure of
  various countries across different continents. The data has columns for the country,
  their military expenditure in millions of USD, and the continent they belong to.
  Please create a heatmap where the x-axis represents the countries and the y-axis
  represents the continents. The color intensity should reflect the military expenditure,
  with higher values showing darker colors. This way, I can easily compare the spending
  across different regions and countries. Make sure the heatmap is clear and labels
  are readable. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for indicating
  the range of military expenditure?

  2. How would you like the countries and continents to be sorted or organized on
  the axes?

  3. Do you want specific labels or annotations on the heatmap to highlight certain
  countries or continents?

  4. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the axis labels and numbers to
  ensure they are readable?

  5. Would you prefer any borders or gridlines to separate the individual cells in
  the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific color intensity levels or thresholds you have in mind
  for indicating low, medium, and high expenditures?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or color bar on the heatmap to indicate the
  expenditure values corresponding to different colors?'
