initial_prompt: Visualize the military expenditure across different countries and
  continents with a column chart. Emphasize the figures for top spenders (like the
  United States and Russia) by using text annotations to highlight their expenditure
  in million USD. Utilize different colors for countries to distinguish them and highlight
  data on Europe as a key region. Annotations should focus on drawing attention to
  the highest and lowest expenditures. Aimed at providing a clear comparison of military
  spending, this chart could be used for governmental or educational purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a color palette preference for the countries?

  2. Would you like any particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Should specific countries in Europe be highlighted differently from other countries?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the column chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal columns)?

  5. Are there any additional elements you would like to include in the chart, such
  as a legend or titles for specific sections?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  8. Should the chart include labels for all columns, or only for the top and bottom
  spenders?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be sorted (e.g., from highest
  to lowest expenditure)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or theme?'
