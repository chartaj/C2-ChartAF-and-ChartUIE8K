initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot visualizing the military expenditure by country
  and continent. Each dot should represent a country, placed on the x-axis by "Military
  Expenditure (Million USD)" and color-coded by "Continent." Include a legend to indicate
  which color corresponds to which continent. Make sure to label the axes and provide
  a title that reflects the data scope, such as "Military Expenditure of Various Countries

  interested in government and defense budgets.
