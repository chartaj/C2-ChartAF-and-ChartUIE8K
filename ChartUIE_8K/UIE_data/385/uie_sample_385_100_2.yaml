initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize military expenditure by country, categorized
  by continent (e.g., North America, Europe). Highlight the United States, Russia,
  and Germany as key countries by emphasizing their slices with distinct colors. Provide
  text annotations showing the exact expenditure in million USD for these highlighted
  countries to draw attention to their spending. Use additional non-data-driven annotations
  to give context about the overall expenditure trends across different continents.
  This chart will help in comparing military expenditures and understanding the global
  distribution of military spending.
