initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showcasing military expenditure by country, grouped
  by continent. Annotate the bars representing the top three highest expenditures
  with their values to highlight the most significant spenders. Use different colors
  for each continent to visually distinguish them. The purpose of this visualization
  is to compare military spending across countries and continents effectively. Ensure
  the chart is clear and emphasizes the countries with the highest expenditures while
  providing a comprehensive view of global spending trends in military budgets.
