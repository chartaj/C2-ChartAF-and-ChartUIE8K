initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the Heart Failure Prediction
  Dataset. The x-axis should represent the 'Age' groups, and different bar segments
  should differentiate 'Sex' (M/F). Annotate each segment with values to highlight
  the distribution of 'ChestPainType' within each age group. Use color highlights
  to distinguish between 'HeartDisease' (0/1). This chart will help identify correlations
  between age, sex, chest pain type, and heart disease prevalence. Emphasize data-driven
  and purposeful annotations to draw attention to significant differences or patterns
  in the data. This is for health research analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different segments based
  on ''Sex'' and ''HeartDisease''?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be segmented on the x-axis (e.g., in 5-year
  intervals, 10-year intervals)?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the font size or style of the annotations?

  4. Would you like the bars to be sorted in any particular order, such as ascending
  or descending order of age groups?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the legend to be displayed or positioned
  on the chart?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be for each segment (e.g., only percentages,
  raw counts, or both)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific type of border or separation between the different
  segments within the stacked bars?

  8. Are there any additional statistical indicators or benchmarks you would like
  to include on the chart (e.g., mean age, median age, etc.)?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  10. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. In 10-year intervals, please.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. No specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Both percentages and raw counts, please.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, no additional statistical indicators needed.

  9. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  10. Title: "Heart Failure Prediction: Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, and Heart Disease
  Prevalence"'
