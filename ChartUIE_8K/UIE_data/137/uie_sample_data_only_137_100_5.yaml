  create a line chart using the provided data? Specifically, I would like to visualize
  the trend of MaxHR (maximum heart rate) across different ages for both males and
  females. Additionally, it would be great to differentiate between those who have
  heart disease and those who do not. This will help me understand how heart rate
  varies with age and gender in relation to heart failure. Please make sure the line

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
