initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  the number of pages and average rating of books from the given dataset. The x-axis
  should represent the number of pages, and the y-axis should represent the average
  rating. Ensure each data point is labeled with the book title for clarity. Use color
  coding to differentiate between books by different authors. Additionally, highlight
  any outliers where ratings are extremely high or low compared to the number of pages.
  This will help identify any interesting patterns or anomalies in book lengths and
  their respective ratings for arts and entertainment books.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the color coding to
  differentiate between authors?

  2. Would you like any specific symbols or shapes to represent the data points on
  the scatter plot?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the titles and labels
  on the scatter plot?

  4. Should the outliers be highlighted in a specific color or with a specific marker?

  5. Do you prefer a plain background or one with grid lines for easier interpretation?

  6. Is there a specific range that you would like the x-axis and y-axis to cover?

  7. Would you like any specific information to be included in the chart legend?'
