initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'average_rating'
  from the Goodreads-books dataset related to arts-and-entertainment. Highlight sections
  of the histogram to emphasize groupings of ratings like 4.5-5.0, 4.0-4.5, etc. Add
  annotations in the form of color changes for different rating ranges to make distinctions
  clear. Include shape annotations like lines to denote average ratings and arrows
  to highlight specific points of interest. The purpose of this visualization is to
  understand how book ratings are distributed and identify trends or outliers in the
  data.
