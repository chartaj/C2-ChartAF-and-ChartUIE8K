  from the Goodreads-books dataset related to arts-and-entertainment. Highlight sections
  of the histogram to emphasize groupings of ratings like 4.5-5.0, 4.0-4.5, etc. Add
  annotations in the form of color changes for different rating ranges to make distinctions

  ranges.

  2. I do not know the exact number of bins; I trust your expertise for a suitable
  choice.

  3. For the lines denoting average ratings, I have no specific preference for the
  style but maybe use a contrasting color.

  4. I am not sure which specific points of interest to highlight with arrows.

  5. I have no specific preference for the overall color scheme or theme of the histogram.

  6. I would like annotations to indicate the different rating ranges clearly.'
