02_initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset.
  Use 'Age' on the X-axis and 'ALB' on the Y-axis. The size of bubbles should represent
  'CHOL' levels. Include text annotations for key data points to highlight unusual
  'CHOL' levels, and add highlights to emphasize trends or anomalies in 'ALB' values.
  This will help to identify patterns related to age, albumin, and cholesterol levels
  among the different categories like 'Blood Donor'. Utilize color coding to distinguish
  between 'Sex' (male/female) for better clarity.

  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a bubble chart to visualize the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset. Use ''Age''
  on the X-axis and ''ALB'' on the Y-axis. The size of bubbles should represent ''CHOL''
  levels. Include text annotations for key data points to highlight unusual ''CHOL''
  levels, and add highlights to emphasize trends or anomalies in ''ALB'' values. This
  will help to identify patterns related to age, albumin, and cholesterol levels among
  the different categories like ''Blood Donor''. Utilize color coding to distinguish
