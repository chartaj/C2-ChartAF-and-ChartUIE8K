initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset
  focusing on health parameters. Use Age on the x-axis and AST levels on the y-axis.
  Color code the data points based on the Category (e.g., Blood Donor, Suspect Blood
  Donor, Hepatitis). Include data labels for Sex and add a legend. Ensure missing
  values are handled appropriately. Use different marker shapes to represent unique
  values in Sex. The scatter plot should help visualize any correlation between Age
  and AST levels across the different categories in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different categories\
  \ (e.g., Blood Donor, Suspect Blood Donor, Hepatitis)?\n2. What style or types of\
  \ marker shapes would you prefer to represent unique values in Sex (e.g., circles\
  \ for male, squares for female)?\n3. Would you like the axes to have a uniform scale,\
  \ logarithmic scale, or any other specific type of scaling?\n4. Do you have any\
  \ preferences for the size or appearance of the data labels for Sex?\n5. Are there\
  \ any specific legend positions or styles you would prefer (e.g., top-right, bottom,\
  \ outside the plot)?\n6. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles\
  \ for the chart and axes? \n7. Do you have any preferences for handling missing\
  \ values (e.g., omit, impute with mean, median)?\n8. Would you like grid lines in\
  \ the background, and if so, any specific style (e.g., solid, dashed)?"
