initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset.
  Use 'Age' on the X-axis and 'ALB' on the Y-axis. The size of bubbles should represent
  'CHOL' levels. Include text annotations for key data points to highlight unusual
  'CHOL' levels, and add highlights to emphasize trends or anomalies in 'ALB' values.
  This will help to identify patterns related to age, albumin, and cholesterol levels
  among the different categories like 'Blood Donor'. Utilize color coding to distinguish
  between 'Sex' (male/female) for better clarity.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color palette for distinguishing between
  ''Sex'' categories?

  2. How would you like the key data points with unusual ''CHOL'' levels to be annotated
  (e.g., specific labels, symbols)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the size scale of the bubbles representing ''CHOL''
  levels?

  4. Should the highlights for trends or anomalies in ''ALB'' values be in a specific
  color or style?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style of the text annotations?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be positioned
  on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the chart?

  8. Is there a specific range or format you prefer for the ''Age'' and ''ALB'' axes?

  9. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart, and if so, any specific styling?

  10. Should there be any specific titles or labels for the axes and chart?'
