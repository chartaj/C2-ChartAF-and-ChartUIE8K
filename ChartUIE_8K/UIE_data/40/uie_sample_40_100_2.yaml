initial_prompt: 'I want to create a box chart using the Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset.
  Please visualize the distribution of the following variables: Age, ALB, ALP, ALT,
  AST, BIL, CHE, CHOL, CREA, GGT, and PROT. I want to compare the statistical spread
  and identify any potential outliers for each of these variables. The data is classified
  by Category, and I''d prefer it to be color-coded based on Sex. This will help in
  analyzing the variances and outlier detections within the different demographics,
  specifically for each health marker. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to represent different
  sexes?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background to assist in reading
  the values?

  3. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color coding for Sex?

  4. Should the box plots be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the variables to be displayed on
  the chart?

  6. Would you like to include mean or median markers in the box plots?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the inclusion and style of data labels or annotations
  for the outliers?

  8. Should the y-axis be the same scale for all variables, or customized for each
  variable?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitles for the chart? If so, do you
  have any specific text in mind?'
