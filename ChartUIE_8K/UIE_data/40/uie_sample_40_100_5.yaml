initial_prompt: 'I''d like to visualize the distribution of liver enzymes in the Hepatitis
  C Prediction Dataset. Specifically, create histograms for the following columns:
  ALB (Albumin), ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase), ALT (Alanine Aminotransferase), AST (Aspartate
  Aminotransferase), BIL (Bilirubin), CHE (Cholinesterase), CHOL (Cholesterol), CREA
  (Creatinine), and GGT (Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase). The histograms should show the
  frequency of values for each enzyme, enabling me to see the spread and central tendencies.
  Use different colors for each histogram for clarity.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used for
  the histograms?

  2. How many bins would you prefer for each histogram, or should the number of bins
  be automatically determined?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines in the histograms for better readability?

  4. Should the histograms include annotations for mean or median values to highlight
  central tendencies?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style for the histograms (e.g., bar width, border
  color)?

  6. Would you like the histograms to be displayed in a single combined figure or
  as separate figures for each enzyme?

  7. Do you have preferences for the labeling style for the axes and titles?

  8. Should we include any reference lines or markers to indicate specific thresholds
  or clinical norms in the histograms?

  9. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the legends and axis labels
  (e.g., font size, font type)?

  10. Would you like to display any additional statistical information (such as standard
  deviation or interquartile range) on the histograms?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, please choose an appropriate number of bins automatically.

  3. Yes, I would like to include gridlines for better readability.

  4. Yes, including annotations for mean values would be helpful.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. A single combined figure would be fine.

  7. I do not have any specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have any specific formatting requirements.

  10. I do not need additional statistical information displayed on the histograms.'
