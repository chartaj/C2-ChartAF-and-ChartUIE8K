initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between different
  blood test parameters (ALB, ALP, ALT, AST, BIL, CHE, CHOL, CREA, GGT, PROT) in the
  Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset. The heatmap should help to easily identify which
  parameters have strong positive or negative correlations with each other. Make sure
  to highlight both strong correlations and weak or no correlations in the heatmap
  for a comprehensive analysis. Use shades of blue for positive correlations and shades
  of red for negative correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific range of correlations that you would like to
  be highlighted as strong?

  2. What threshold values would you prefer for distinguishing between strong, weak,
  and no correlations?

  3. Do you have a preference for the color intensity for both strong positive and
  negative correlations?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to include numerical values within each cell to represent
  the correlation coefficient?

  5. How would you prefer the correlation matrix to be sorted (e.g., alphabetical
  order of parameters, by strength of correlation, etc.)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the size and dimensions of the heatmap?

  7. Should axis labels be oriented in a specific way (e.g., horizontal, vertical,
  diagonal)?

  8. Is there any specific title or labeling you would like for the heatmap and its
  axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like the heatmap to include numerical values within each cell to
  represent the correlation coefficient.

  5. By strength of correlation would be preferable.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No specific title or labeling preferences.'
