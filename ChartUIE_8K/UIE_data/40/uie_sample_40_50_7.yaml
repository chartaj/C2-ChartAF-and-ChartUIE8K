initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing trends of ALT, AST, and BIL levels in
  different Age groups. Use different colors for each category.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different categories (ALT,
  AST, BIL)?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which colors correspond to which
  categories?

  3. How should the age groups be segmented (e.g., by decade, specific age ranges)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the appearance of the lines (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines to make it easier to read the trends?

  6. Should the chart include data point markers along the lines?

  7. Do you have specific labeling preferences for the axes (e.g., ''Age Group'' for
  the x-axis, ''Level'' for the y-axis)?

  8. Would you like any specific titles or annotations included on the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  10. Should the chart include error bars to represent variability or uncertainty
