initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart to compare the worldwide gross
  ($m), domestic gross ($m), and international gross ($m) for each film in the dataset.
  The X-axis should represent the films, and each stack should show the breakdown
  of these three gross categories. Include labels showing the percentage each part
  contributes to the total gross. Highlight different categories like "Ant-Man," "Avengers,"
  etc., with distinct color coding. Title the chart "Marvel Superhero Movies Box Office
  Performance" and ensure the legend is clear.
