initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart visualizing the worldwide gross ($m)
  for Marvel superhero movies over the years. Plot the 'worldwide gross ($m)' on the
  y-axis and 'year' on the x-axis. Use different colored lines for each 'category'
  to distinguish between the various superhero franchises. Include data labels for
  'film' at each data point for clarity. Additionally, use markers to identify the
  'opening weekend ($m)' on the spline chart. Make sure the chart is easy to read
  and highlights trends in gross revenue over the specified years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  categories?

  2. What specific font style and size would you like for data labels?

  3. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style and size of the markers identifying ''opening
  weekend ($m)''?

  5. How should the y-axis and x-axis be labeled? Do you have a preferred font style
  and size for these labels?

  6. Would you prefer any specific gridlines or background style for the chart?

  7. Is there a particular way you want the trend lines to be smoothed in the spline
  chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences regarding the inclusion or exclusion of axis lines
  or tick marks?'
