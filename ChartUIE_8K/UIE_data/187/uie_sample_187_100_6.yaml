initial_prompt: I want a range chart to visualize the performance of Marvel Superhero
  Movies. This chart should showcase 'worldwide gross ($m)' on a vertical axis and
  'year' on the horizontal axis. Each movie's range should show the opening weekend
  and final worldwide gross. Include markers for the 'budget' to compare with the
  worldwide gross. I also want different colors for each 'category' to differentiate
  movies like Ant-Man and Avengers. Make sure the drop-off percentages and budget
  recovery percentages are shown as tooltips when hovering over the data points. Use
  clear labels and a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to represent different
  categories?

  2. Do you want the budget markers to be represented as a specific shape or size?

  3. How detailed should the tooltips be? Should they include other additional data
  points like ''domestic gross ($m)'' and ''international gross ($m)''?

  4. Would you prefer the range chart to be a specific type such as a bar range, line
  range, or area range?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and legend?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines or specific background styles to enhance
  readability?

  7. Is there a preferred order for the categories to appear in the legend?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights for key movies or specific
  years?'
