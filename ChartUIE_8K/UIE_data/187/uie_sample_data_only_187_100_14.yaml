02_initial_prompt: I'd like a Treemap chart that visualizes the "Marvel Superhero
  Movies" dataset. This chart should display the different categories of films (like
  "Ant-Man," "Avengers") as separate sections. Each section should be sized based
  on the "worldwide gross ($m)" values of the films. Additionally, color-code the
  sections by the "critics % score" to see the correlation between the critics' scores
  and the gross earnings. This will help in understanding how well different categories
  and movies within those categories performed financially and critically.

  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
