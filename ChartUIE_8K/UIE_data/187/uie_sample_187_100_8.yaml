initial_prompt: I have a dataset about Marvel superhero movies, focusing on their
  financial and critical performance. Could you create a box chart for me? I want
  the chart to show the distribution of the worldwide gross ($m) and budget for the
  different movie categories, like "Ant-Man" and "Avengers." The box chart should
  help me easily compare these values across the two categories. Please ensure the
  categories are clearly labeled and include any outliers and medians in the data.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart categories?

  2. Would you like to see individual data points used to calculate the box plots,
  or should I keep the focus on summaries such as quartiles, medians, and outliers?

  3. Should the y-axis be scaled to include the full range of data, or would you prefer
  a zoomed-in view to focus on a specific range?

  4. Do you want gridlines enabled on the chart for better readability?

  5. How much emphasis would you like on the outliers? Should they be prominently
  highlighted?

  6. Would you like any additional annotations or labels on the chart to highlight
  key findings or significant data points?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the style of the box plot, such as traditional
  Tukey boxes, notched boxes, or violin plots for density estimation?

  8. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, please provide the
  exact text.

  9. Do you require any specific margins or padding around the chart for any reason?'
