initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of worldwide gross ($m)
  for Marvel superhero movies. Include all 30 films in the dataset. Use the "worldwide
  gross ($m)" column for the x-axis and the frequency of movies for the y-axis. The
  chart should help visualize how many movies fall into different grossing ranges.
  Highlight the highest-grossing films. Include a title and labels for clarity. Use
  different colors or shades to distinguish between different categories, like "Ant-Man"
  and "Avengers." This will give a clear distribution of Marvel films' worldwide earnings.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the histogram?\n\
  2. How would you like the highest-grossing films to be highlighted (e.g., with a\
  \ different color, a bold outline, annotation)?\n3. Are there specific color preferences\
  \ for distinguishing between different categories, such as \"Ant-Man\" and \"Avengers\"\
  ?\n4. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?\n5. Should\
  \ there be a specific order for the categories in the legend? \n6. Do you want to\
  \ include any specific labels or annotations for the highest-grossing films?\n7.\
  \ Would you prefer the x-axis and y-axis labels to follow a specific format or style?\n\
  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the histogram, or should it simply\
  \ be \"Distribution of Worldwide Gross ($m) for Marvel Superhero Movies\"?"
