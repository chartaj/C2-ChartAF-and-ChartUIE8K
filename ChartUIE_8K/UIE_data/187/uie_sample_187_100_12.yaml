initial_prompt: I want a dumbbell chart that shows the % budget recovered for Marvel
  superhero movies, comparing their first and second weekends' gross. Use different
  colors for each movie. The x-axis should be the percentage of budget recovered,
  and the y-axis should show the movie titles. Include data points for the first and
  second weekends. Make the chart interactive, so I can hover over the points to see
  detailed information like domestic and international gross, critics' and audience
  scores, and the year of release.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to represent each movie?

  2. How would you like the axes labeled or formatted?

  3. Are there any specific fonts, font sizes, or styles you prefer for the chart?

  4. Would you prefer the data points to be displayed with any specific markers or
  shapes?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you would like the movies to be listed on
  the y-axis (e.g., alphabetically, by release year, by % budget recovered, etc.)?

  6. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  7. Would you like any legends or annotations to be included on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the background style or color of the chart?

  9. How would you like the tooltip information to be structured (e.g., order of details,
  any specific data highlighting)?

  10. Are there any specific styling requirements for grid lines or axis lines on
  the chart?'
