initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the worldwide gross of Marvel superhero
  movies. Annotate values for each bar to highlight key figures and add contextual
  text annotations for budget recovery percentages. Utilize color highlights to distinguish
  different movie categories, like 'Ant-Man' and 'Avengers,' to compare their performance
  effectively. The chart should serve to analyze the financial success of these films,
  emphasizing opening weekend figures and the split between domestic and international
  gross. The chart should make it easier to grasp the overall performance and differences
  among these blockbuster movies from Marvel.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title?

  2. What font size and style do you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight different movie
  categories?

  4. Should the bars be sorted in any particular order, such as by worldwide gross
  or release date?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout of the axis labels and legends?

  6. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the annotated values (e.g.,
  nearest million)?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines or other reference lines for better readability?

  8. Do you want to include a specific subtitle or caption for additional context?

  9. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the bar chart?

  10. Are there any specific accessibility considerations you would like us to include
  in the chart design?'
