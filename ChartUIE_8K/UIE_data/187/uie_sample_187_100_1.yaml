initial_prompt: 'Create a radial bar chart to visualize the financial performance
  and audience reception of Marvel Superhero Movies. Highlight critical metrics like
  ''worldwide gross ($m)'', ''% budget recovered'', ''critics % score'', and ''audience
  % score''. Use text annotations to emphasize notable data points such as ''Ant-Man'',
  ''Ant-Man & The Wasp'', and ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''. Include highlights to differentiate
  between movies based on budget and gross revenue. The chart should help compare
  the box office success and audience response, focusing viewer attention on key figures.'

  based on budget and gross revenue?

  2. What style or font would you like for the text annotations on notable data points?

  date, alphabetical order of film names, or by performance metrics)?

  4. Are there any additional metrics or data points you would like to include or
  emphasize in the chart?

  5. Do you have any specific size or aspect ratio preferences for the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any specific labels or legends to distinguish between
  different metrics more clearly?

  between movies (e.g., thicker lines, different shades, or patterns)?'
