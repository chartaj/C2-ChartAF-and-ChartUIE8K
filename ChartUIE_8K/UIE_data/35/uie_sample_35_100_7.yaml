initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the "Customer_Age"
  of Credit Card customers. Make sure to use data from the CSV file provided to create
  the age bins for the histogram. This will help us understand the age demographics
  of our customer base more effectively. Include labels for the x-axis as "Customer
  Age" and for the y-axis as "Number of Customers." Also, title the chart as "Age
  Distribution of Credit Card Customers." Thank you.
questions: '1. What bin size or range would you prefer for the age bins in the histogram?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the histogram?

  3. Should the x-axis or y-axis have a specific scale (linear, logarithmic)?

  4. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the labels and title?

  5. Do you prefer to have any grid lines displayed on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific age ranges you would like to highlight or annotate in
  the histogram?

  7. Should the histogram display cumulative frequencies, or just the count for each
  bin?

  8. Is there a particular layout or dimension you would like the chart to have (e.g.,
  aspect ratio)?

  9. Do you require any additional legends or markers on the histogram?'
