initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that shows the average credit limit and
  the total transaction amount by customer age group for our credit card customers.
  Use the sample data provided. The X-axis should represent customer age groups (e.g.,
  40-45, 46-50, 51-55), and the Y-axis should show the average credit limit on one
  column and the total transaction amount on another. Separate the columns by age
  group and color them differently for clarity. This will help us visualize the spending
  behavior and credit limits across different age groups in our customer base.
questions: '1. Do you have specific age groups in mind, or should the standard groups
  (e.g., 40-45, 46-50, 51-55) be used?

  2. Do you prefer any specific colors for the columns representing average credit
  limit and total transaction amount?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the columns to show the exact values?

  4. Is there a specific order you want the age groups displayed in on the X-axis?

  5. Do you need any specific formatting or scales for the Y-axis (such as currency
  format for average credit limit and total transaction amount)?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should there be any additional elements like gridlines or annotations on the
  chart?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the columns for average
  credit limit and total transaction amount?

  9. Do you require any specific title for the chart?

  10. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?'
