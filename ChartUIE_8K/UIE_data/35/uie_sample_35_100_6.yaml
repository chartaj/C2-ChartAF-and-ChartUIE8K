initial_prompt: I want a grouped bar chart that compares the average credit limit,
  total revolving balance, and average open-to-buy among different income categories
  for credit card customers. Please group the bars by income category and use different
  colors for each measured value. Also, include a legend to clarify which color represents
  each value (credit limit, revolving balance, open-to-buy). Make sure the X-axis
  represents different income categories and the Y-axis shows the monetary values.
  This will help visualize financial behavior differences across various income levels.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars representing ''credit
  limit'', ''total revolving balance'', and ''average open-to-buy''?

  2. What title would you like to display on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font types or sizes for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the income categories on the X-axis be sorted in any specific order (e.g.,
  ascending, descending)?

  5. Would you like to display data labels on the bars indicating the exact values?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the style and thickness of the bar borders?

  7. Should the Y-axis be formatted in a particular way, such as including currency
  symbols?

  8. Do you want gridlines in the background of the chart, and if so, should they
  follow a specific style or color?

  9. Is there a specific range you would like to set for the Y-axis?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or additional text on the chart?

  11. Do you have a preference for the chart size or aspect ratio?'
