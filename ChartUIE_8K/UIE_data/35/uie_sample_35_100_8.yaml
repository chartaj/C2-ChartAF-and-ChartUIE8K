initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the 'Attrition_Flag' column
  from the provided credit card customers dataset. I want to see the proportion of
  "Existing Customer" versus "Attrited Customer". This will help illustrate the overall
  customer retention rate. Make sure the chart has labels indicating the percentage
  or the number of customers in each category. Could you color-code each section for
  better distinction, perhaps using contrasting colors like blue and red? Lastly,
  include a title like "Customer Attrition Distribution" for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the font style or size used for the chart
  title and labels?

  2. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  3. Would you like to include data labels inside the pie slices, outside, or both?

  4. Do you prefer any particular pie chart style (e.g., 3D effect, exploded slices)?

  5. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the percentages or numbers
  (e.g., decimal places, percentage symbol)?

  6. Any preference for the overall color scheme or background color of the chart?

  7. Do you require any additional annotations or textual explanations within the
  chart?

  8. Should there be any specific margin or padding settings around the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Both inside and outside would be nice.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Just the percentage symbol will be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
