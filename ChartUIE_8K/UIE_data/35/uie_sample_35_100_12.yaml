initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize credit card customer data using a scatter plot.
  Please create a scatter plot showing the relationship between 'Customer_Age' and
  'Total_Trans_Amt'. Use different colors to distinguish between 'Marital_Status'
  categories ('Married', 'Single', etc.). Also, vary the size of the scatter points
  based on the 'Credit_Limit'. The x-axis should be 'Customer_Age' and the y-axis
  'Total_Trans_Amt'. This will help in understanding how transaction amount varies
  with age and marital status. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer for each ''Marital_Status''
  category?

  2. What range of sizes do you prefer for the scatter points based on ''Credit_Limit''?

  3. Should the scatter plot include a legend indicating the ''Marital_Status'' categories
  and point sizes?

  4. Would you like any specific markers or shapes for the scatter points?

  5. Do you prefer any specific type of gridlines or background?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or labels on specific data points?

  7. Do you want to include any trend lines or regression lines in the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any particular axis labels or titles you''d like to use?

  9. Do you have preferences for the font type and size used in the chart?

  10. Would you like to set any specific axis limits for ''Customer_Age'' and ''Total_Trans_Amt''?'
