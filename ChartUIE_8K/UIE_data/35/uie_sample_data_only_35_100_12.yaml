  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  <start of user request>

  I''d like to visualize credit card customer data using a scatter plot. Please create
  a scatter plot showing the relationship between ''Customer_Age'' and ''Total_Trans_Amt''.
  Use different colors to distinguish between ''Marital_Status'' categories (''Married'',
  ''Single'', etc.). Also, vary the size of the scatter points based on the ''Credit_Limit''.
  The x-axis should be ''Customer_Age'' and the y-axis ''Total_Trans_Amt''. This will
  help in understanding how transaction amount varies with age and marital status.
  Thank you!
