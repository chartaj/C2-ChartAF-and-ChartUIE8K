initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between income levels
  and the amount spent on wines among customers. On the x-axis, plot 'Income', and
  on the y-axis, plot 'MntWines'. Each dot should represent an individual customer,
  with color coding based on 'Education' level to provide additional insights into
  any patterns or clusters. This will help in understanding if education level influences
  spending on wines relative to income. Data points with missing 'Income' values should
  be excluded. Ensure the plot clearly labels each axis and includes a legend for
  educational levels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the dot colors representing
  different education levels?

  2. Would you like the plot to include gridlines for better readability? If yes,
  which style do you prefer?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the axis labels
  and legend?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the dots in the plot?

  5. Should the income axis be in linear scale, log scale, or any other preferred
  scale?

  6. What title would you like to have for the plot, if any?

  7. Would you prefer any annotations or data labels for the dots?

  8. Do you have a preferred orientation for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?'

  2. Yes, gridlines would be helpful. I do not know which style to prefer.
