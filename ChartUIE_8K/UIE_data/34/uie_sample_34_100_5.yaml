initial_prompt: I need a pie chart visualizing the distribution of different education
  levels among customers. The chart should show the proportion of people with various
  education backgrounds (Graduation, PhD, Master, Basic, 2n Cycle). This will help
  analyze the customer base's education diversity. Use the 'Education' column from
  the data. Please make sure each education category is represented clearly, with
  a legend or labels indicating the percentage or count for each segment. This visualization
  is for a business report on customer personality analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the pie
  chart?

  2. Do you prefer the segments to be labeled with percentages, counts, or both?

  3. How detailed do you want the legend to be?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a title and subtitle? If so, what should
  they be?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the order of the segments (e.g., descending order
  of size)?

  7. Should the pie chart include any special effects such as 3D or shadows?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the size and aspect ratio of the chart?

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the chart? If yes, please specify.'
