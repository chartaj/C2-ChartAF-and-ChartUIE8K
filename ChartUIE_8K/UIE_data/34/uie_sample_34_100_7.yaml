initial_prompt: I want a treemap to analyze customer personality traits from the dataset.
  The treemap should categorize customers based on their marital status and education
  level. Each inner box should represent education, and its size should reflect the
  average income within each marital status category. Additionally, color-code the
  boxes based on the average amount spent on wines (MntWines) to indicate different
  spending levels. This visualization should help us understand the relationship between
  marital status, education level, income, and spending on wines in a concise manner.
  Use data from '../Extra_datas/data/34.csv' for this analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to represent
  different spending levels on wines?

  2. How would you like the income ranges to be displayed within each education level?
  Should it be in specific intervals?

  3. Do you prefer any particular labels or annotations to be included in the treemap,
  such as average income values or marital status categories?

  4. Is there a specific order in which the marital status categories should be displayed
  in the treemap?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style and size of the text within the
  treemap boxes?

  6. Should the treemap include a legend to explain the color-coding based on the
  spending levels on wines?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would prefer average income values and marital status categories to be included.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Yes, the treemap should include a legend to explain the color-coding based on
  the spending levels on wines.'
