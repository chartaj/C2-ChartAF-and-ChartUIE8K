initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between Income and
  various amounts spent on different product categories (e.g., MntWines, MntFruits).
  Use color coding to differentiate between Education levels and shape coding for
  Marital_Status. This will help analyze spending behavior across different demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to be used
  for different Education levels?

  2. Is there a preferred shape for each Marital_Status category (e.g., circles for
  single, squares for married)?

  3. What title would you like the scatter plot to have?

  4. Should axes include specific labels or units?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  6. Should the plot include a legend for color and shape coding? If so, do you have
  a preferred position for the legend?

  7. Would you like to include any grid lines or background features on the scatter
  plot?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or limits you would like to set for the axes?

  9. How would you like the data points to be displayed when multiple product categories
  (e.g., MntWines, MntFruits) are plotted? Should each category be plotted separately
  or combined?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall aspect ratio or dimension of the scatter
  plot?'
