  Create a grouped bar chart to compare customer spending across various product categories
  based on their marital status from the Customer Personality Analysis data. Use ''Marital_Status''
  as the grouping variable on the x-axis, with bars representing average spending
  in ''MntWines'', ''MntFruits'', ''MntMeatProducts'', ''MntFishProducts'', ''MntSweetProducts'',
  and ''MntGoldProds''. This visualization will help identify spending trends and
  preferences among different marital status groups.
