initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between different columns
  such as Income, MntWines, MntMeatProducts, and NumWebPurchases. Focus specifically
  on finding patterns that could provide insights into customer spending behaviors
  and preferences. Highlight any significant correlations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include annotation of correlation values on the
  cells?

  3. Should the heatmap display only significant correlations, or all correlation
  values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific scaling method (e.g., standardization) applied to
  the data before visualization?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or size for the heatmap?

  6. Would you like a specific title or labels for the heatmap axes?

  7. Should the heatmap include axis labels or legends to explain the color intensity?

  8. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the correlation values (e.g.,
  rounding to a certain number of decimal places)?

  9. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or notes alongside
  the heatmap?'
