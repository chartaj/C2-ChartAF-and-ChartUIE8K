initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  "Income" and "MntWines" spending by customers. This will help me understand how
  income impacts wine expenditure. Use "Income" for the x-axis and "MntWines" for
  the y-axis. Differentiate the points by "Education" levels to see if education influences
  spending habits. Also, use different colors for different "Marital_Status" categories
  to identify any patterns or trends based on marital status. The data comes from
  a Customer Personality Analysis, so tailor the chart to reflect these customer insights
  accurately.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels or formatting?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer any particular color palette for differentiating the "Marital_Status"
  categories?

  5. Should the legend be positioned in any specific location on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred shape for the points representing different "Education"
  levels?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes within the chart to highlight
  specific trends or data points?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the labels and
  title?

  9. Do you want the chart background to be in a specific color or style?

  10. Are there any additional elements or features you would like to include to enhance
  the visualization?'
