initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare customer spending across various
  product categories based on their marital status from the Customer Personality Analysis
  data. Use 'Marital_Status' as the grouping variable on the x-axis, with bars representing
  average spending in 'MntWines', 'MntFruits', 'MntMeatProducts', 'MntFishProducts',

  trends and preferences among different marital status groups.
