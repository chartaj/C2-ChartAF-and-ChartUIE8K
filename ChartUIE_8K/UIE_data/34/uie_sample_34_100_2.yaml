initial_prompt: I need a line chart for visualizing customer spending trends over
  various product categories in the year. Use columns like 'MntWines', 'MntFruits',
  'MntMeatProducts', 'MntFishProducts', 'MntSweetProducts', and 'MntGoldProds'. Highlight
  notable spikes or dips in spending to identify key purchasing seasons or trends.
  Add text annotations for data points where there is a significant change in spending.
  This will help in understanding customer personality and preferences over time.
  Make sure the chart clearly distinguishes each product category for easy comparison
  and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing each product
  category?

  2. Should the x-axis represent time in months, quarters, or some other interval?

  3. Are there any specific labels or text annotations you want to include for significant
  changes in spending?

  4. Do you prefer markers for data points where spending changes significantly, in
  addition to text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which line corresponds to which
  product category?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)
  for different product categories?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines or background shading to enhance readability?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for text annotations and
  axis labels?'
