initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization using the data from "../Extra_datas/data/4.csv".
  The treemap should display the hierarchy of 'isic_section', 'isic_division', 'industry_name',
  and 'Industry_group_name'. Each rectangle's size should represent the number of
  industries within each group. This will help in understanding the distribution and
  concentration of different industry sections and divisions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different sections or
  divisions?

  2. Would you prefer the labels to be displayed inside the rectangles or outside?

  3. Should the rectangles be sized strictly proportional to the number of industries,
  or should there be a minimum size for readability?

  4. Do you want to include the exact count of industries within each rectangle as
  a label?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels?

  6. Are there any particular sections or divisions you want to highlight using a
  different color or border?

  7. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color codes for the sections
  and divisions?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout style for the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  9. Should the treemap include tooltips for additional information on hover?'
