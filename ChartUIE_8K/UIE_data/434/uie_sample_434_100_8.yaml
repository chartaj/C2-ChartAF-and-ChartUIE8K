initial_prompt: Create a box chart that visualizes the distances covered in each Tour
  de France edition from 1903 to 2019. Ensure the chart displays the distribution
  and variance of the distances. Also, add box plots to represent the winner's age
  and weight in each edition, so we can compare the ranges and find outliers. Modify
  the color of the boxes to differentiate between distance, age, and weight datasets
  clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the chart?

  2. Is there a specific color scheme you would like to use for the distance, age,
  and weight box plots?

  3. Would you like to add grid lines to the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you want the data points (outliers) to be marked in a specific way?

  5. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  6. Should the chart include specific annotations or comments on notable data points
  or outliers?

  7. Would you like the axes to have logarithmic scaling or any specific range settings?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If so, what should the title be?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding?'
