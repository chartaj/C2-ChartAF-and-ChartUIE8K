  Y-axis label should be either "Overall Time" or "Distance".

  3. Yes, please highlight famous winners like Lance Armstrong, Eddy Merckx, and the
  oldest winner.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Circles are fine.

  6. Yes, include a legend to explain the different colors and sizes.

  7. Yes, please include a trendline.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.
