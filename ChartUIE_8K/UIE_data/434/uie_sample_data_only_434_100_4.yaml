02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset about the Tour de France from 1903 to 2019. I
  want to create a geographic heatmap that visualizes the birth towns of the winners.
  The map should show the density of winners from different towns around the world.
  It should highlight towns based on the number of winners born there. I am particularly
  interested in seeing which towns and countries have produced the most winners. Please
  use the "birth_town" and "birth_country" fields from the dataset to create the heatmap.
  Make sure to use a color gradient to represent the density.
