initial_prompt: Create a histogram using the Tour de France data from 1903 to 2019.
  The x-axis should represent the years (edition) and the y-axis should show the number
  of stage wins. Use text annotations to highlight the years with the highest and
  lowest stage wins. Additionally, employ highlights to distinguish the years with
  significant differences in data, such as the year with the shortest time margin
  between the winner and the runner-up. The purpose is to identify trends and significant
  events throughout the history of the race. The chart should visually capture the
  evolution of the race in terms of challenging stages.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlights on the
  chart?

  2. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the chart for easier visualization of values?

  4. Is there a specific format you want the year (edition) labels on the x-axis to
  follow?

  5. How detailed should the y-axis scale be to represent stage wins (e.g., every
  1 stage win, every 5 stage wins, etc.)?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  7. Should the legend include a description of the highlighted years with significant
  differences (e.g., shortest time margin)?

  8. Do you want to include any additional notes or captions below the chart?'
