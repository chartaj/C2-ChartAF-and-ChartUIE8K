initial_prompt: I would like a stacked bar chart visualizing the Tour de France winners
  from 1903 to 2019. Each bar should represent an edition of the race, stacked by
  the winner's stage wins and stages led. Annotations should highlight the winner's
  name, team, and age for key years like 1903, 1957, and 2019. The chart should emphasize
  unique achievements and trends in winners' performance over time. Use different
  colors to distinguish between the stage wins and stages led in each bar to make
  the chart more informative and visually engaging.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  the stage wins and stages led?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the annotations?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or theme (e.g.,
  light, dark, or specific colors)?

  4. Is there a particular order you would like the bars to be displayed in (e.g.,
  chronological, reverse chronological)?

  5. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?

  6. Should the annotations for key years be prominently displayed with a specific
  color or style?

  7. Would you like any grid lines or axis labels to be customized in a particular
  way?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the placement of the legend or other chart elements?

  9. Should the bars have any specific visual effects (e.g., shadows, borders)?

  10. Are there any additional data points or details you would like to be included
  or emphasized in the visualization?'
