initial_prompt: I have a dataset about the Tour de France from 1903 to 2019. I want
  to create a geographic heatmap that visualizes the birth towns of the winners. The
  map should show the density of winners from different towns around the world. It
  should highlight towns based on the number of winners born there. I am particularly
  interested in seeing which towns and countries have produced the most winners. Please
  use the "birth_town" and "birth_country" fields from the dataset to create the heatmap.
  Make sure to use a color gradient to represent the density.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color gradient preference for representing the
  density on the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include country borders or other geographical boundaries on
  the map?

  3. Do you prefer any specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.) for
  the geographic heatmap?

  4. Should the map also display labels for towns and/or countries, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without labels?

  5. Are there any particular regions or towns you would like to be highlighted or
  focused on more prominently?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the base map style (e.g., satellite view,
  street view, terrain view, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include country borders.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer a cleaner look without labels.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
