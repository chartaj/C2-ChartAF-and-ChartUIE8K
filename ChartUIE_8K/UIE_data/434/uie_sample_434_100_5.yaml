initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart visualizing the average distance and time overall
  per edition of the Tour de France from 1903 to 2019. Use ''edition'' on the x-axis
  and plot two lines: one for ''distance'' and another for ''time_overall'' on the
  y-axis. Ensure to label the axes and include a legend to distinguish between the
  two lines. Highlight any missing data points or gaps in the series. This chart should
