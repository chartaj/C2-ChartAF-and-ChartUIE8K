initial_prompt: I want a heatmap showing the correlation between different Pokémon
  stats. The data includes columns like hp, attack, defense, sp_attack, sp_defense,
  and speed. Highlight key areas with strong positive or negative correlations, with
  clear text annotations for values above 0.7 or below -0.7. The purpose is to visualize
  how different stats are related to each other, which would be useful for understanding
  Pokémon strengths and weaknesses. Make sure to highlight any significant findings
  so they're easily noticeable in the heatmap. This is for a Pokémon game analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want the heatmap to include a color legend to indicate the strength of
  the correlations?

  3. Should the heatmap display grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the font style or size for the text annotations
  in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include axis labels and titles for the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap be oriented in a specific way (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for highlighting the significant findings?

  8. Do you want to include any additional information or context (e.g., Pokémon types)
  in the visualization?'
