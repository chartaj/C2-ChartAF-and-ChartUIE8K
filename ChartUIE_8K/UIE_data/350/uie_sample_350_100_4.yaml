initial_prompt: I have a dataset that provides detailed stats about various Pokémon,
  such as their number, name, types, total stats, individual stats (hp, attack, defense,
  etc.), generation, and whether they are legendary. I want to create a box chart
  to visualize the distribution of the main stats (total, hp, attack, defense, sp_attack,
  sp_defense, speed) of different Pokémon. Please also include separate boxes for
  legendary and non-legendary Pokémon to compare their stats. The box chart should
  help identify the range, median, and any potential outliers for each stat category.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the chart?

  2. Would you like the boxes for legendary and non-legendary Pokémon to have distinct
  colors or patterns?

  3. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should the chart include individual data points overlaid on the box plots?

  5. Do you have any specific preference for the axis labels'' format and style?

  6. Would you like to include a title and subtitle on the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Do you prefer to display the median value explicitly on the box chart?

  8. Should the chart legend include specific details or be formatted in a particular
  way?

  9. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the text on the chart?

  10. Do you want to include annotations for any particular data points or outliers?'
