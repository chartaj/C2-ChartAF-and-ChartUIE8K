initial_prompt: I need a line chart of life expectancy over the years for each country
  from the data. The x-axis should represent the year (use 'year' and 'year_a' data)
  and the y-axis should represent the life expectancy in years. Different countries
  should be represented with different colored lines. This is for a social science
  project, so the visualization needs to be clear and emphasize changes over time.
  Make sure missing population data is handled appropriately. Labels and a legend
  are necessary to identify each country clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used for different
  countries?

  2. Should the labels for each axis be in a specific format or style?

  3. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight prominently?

  5. How should missing population data be indicated or handled on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and legend?

  7. Would you like any annotations or markers on significant data points?

  8. Should the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) differ across countries or data segments?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, grid lines on the chart for better readability would be helpful.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Missing population data should be interpolated or handled in a way that doesnâ€™t
  disrupt the line trends.

  6. I do not have any specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
