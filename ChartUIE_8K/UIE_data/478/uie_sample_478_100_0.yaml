initial_prompt: Visualize the data using a stacked bar chart. The chart should display
  'Life expectancy in years' and 'Income (GDP per capita)' for each country. Use different
  colors for each metric to distinguish them. Ensure missing values are handled appropriately
  by noting them in annotations. Highlight countries with significantly lower life
  expectancy or income. Include text annotations to emphasize the figures for underrepresented
  continents and unique countries. The chart should provide insights into the socio-economic
  conditions across different continents in 1800, helping viewers to quickly grasp
  disparities and unique characteristics in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating ''Life expectancy
  in years'' and ''Income (GDP per capita)''?

  2. Would you like the countries with significantly lower life expectancy or income
  to be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., bold borders, different colors)?

  3. Are there any specific continents or countries you want to emphasize with text
  annotations?

  4. How should missing values be annotated on the chart?

  5. Do you have a preference for the arrangement of the bars (e.g., sorted by life
  expectancy, GDP per capita, or alphabetically)?'
