initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map illustrating the "Life expectancy in years"
  across different countries. The map should visually distinguish countries using
  color gradients to represent varying life expectancies. Incorporate text annotations
  for countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy to draw attention. Additionally,
  highlight countries with missing population data differently for clarity. The map's
  primary purpose is to offer a global perspective on life expectancy trends in 1800,
  providing a comparison between continents and drawing insights into historical health
  patterns. Ensure the map is accessible for social-science research and educational
  purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradient preferences for representing
  varying life expectancies?

  2. Would you prefer any particular color scheme or style for highlighting countries
  with missing population data?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations indicating
  countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy?

  4. Should the map include a legend, and if so, do you have any preferences for its
  position or design?

  5. Do you have any preference for the geographic projection used in the map (e.g.,
  Mercator, Robinson)?

  6. Are there any specific countries or continents you want to emphasize or make
  more prominent on the map?

  7. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or annotations
  on the map (e.g., historical events, economic data)?

  8. Do you prefer a specific background color or texture for the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include a legend. I don''t have any preferences for its position
  or design.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No, just the life expectancy data is enough.

  8. No specific preference.'
