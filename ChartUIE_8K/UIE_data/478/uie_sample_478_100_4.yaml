initial_prompt: I need a grouped column chart showing the life expectancy and income
  (GDP per capita) for different countries grouped by continent. The x-axis should
  have the country names, and the y-axis should represent the values for life expectancy
  and income. Use different colors for life expectancy and income. Additionally, indicate
  the continents with labels or color coding in the background to differentiate the
  countries based on their continents. Make sure to handle the missing population
  data carefully and mention it if it impacts the visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the life expectancy
  and income (GDP per capita) bars?

  2. How would you like the continents to be indicated in the background â€“ through
  specific color coding or labeled regions?

  3. Should the missing population data be explicitly mentioned in a legend or as
  a footnote in the chart?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to include data labels on the bars for precise values of life
  expectancy and income?

  7. Should the chart include a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  8. Are there any particular dimensions you have in mind for the chart (e.g., width
  and height)?

  9. Would you like to apply any specific sorting order for the countries on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical or by continent)?'
