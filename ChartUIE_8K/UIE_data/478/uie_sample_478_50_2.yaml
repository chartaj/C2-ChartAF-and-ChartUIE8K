initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing Life expectancy in years across different
  countries in 1800, highlighting specific areas based on income levels. Add text
  annotations for regions with notably high or low life expectancy. Focus on making
  Africa and Australia stand out clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the choropleth
  map?

  2. Would you like to use a specific color gradient for highlighting income levels?

  3. Are there any particular color preferences for making Africa and Australia stand
  out?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for the text annotations?

  5. Should the text annotations include additional details apart from high or low
  life expectancy, such as GDP per capita or population size?

  6. Do you have a preferred font size or style for the country names and annotations
  on the map?

  7. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include on the map
  for better clarity?

  8. Would you prefer the highlighting of life expectancy extremes to be based on
  absolute values or relative to the regional data?

  9. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  10. Would you like any additional visual aids, such as markers or symbols, to further
  emphasize areas with extreme values?'
