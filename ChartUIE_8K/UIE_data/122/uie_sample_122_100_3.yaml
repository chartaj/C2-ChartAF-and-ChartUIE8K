initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart to visualize the "Global_Sales" over "Year"
  for the top-selling video games. Plot the "Name" of the games on the legend to differentiate
  each line. Ensure the x-axis represents "Year" and the y-axis shows "Global_Sales"
  in millions. Highlight significant sales trends and peaks for major titles across
  the years. This will help analyze the popularity and success of different games
  over time. Please ensure the data points are easy to distinguish with markers and
  make the chart color-coded for better clarity and engagement.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the lines representing each
  game?

  2. Would you like to customize the markers on the data points (e.g., shape, size)?

  3. Are there specific years you want to highlight, perhaps with annotations?

  4. Would you prefer a particular font type or size for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Is there a specific way you''d like the legend to be positioned?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart background color or gridlines'' appearance?

  7. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Would you like the chart to include any reference lines or zones to emphasize
  significant trends or peaks?

  9. Is there a preferred format for displaying the y-axis values (e.g., with thousand
  separators, abbreviations)?

  10. Do you want the axis range to be fixed or adaptive to the data provided?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences.

  2. I do not know, any default markers should be fine.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure about the font type or size.

  5. I do not know, any standard positioning for the legend is acceptable.

  6. I have no specific preference for the background color or gridlines.

  7. Yes, please title it "Top-Selling Video Games Global Sales Over the Years".

  8. I am not sure, perhaps some significant trends or peaks could be highlighted
  if it''s clear.

  9. Yes, please display the y-axis values with million abbreviations (e.g., 1M for
  one million).

  10. I do not know, adaptive to the data provided sounds good.'
