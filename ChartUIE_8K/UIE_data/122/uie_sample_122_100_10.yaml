initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of video game
  sales. Specifically, I want to see how many games fall into different global sales
  brackets. Use the "Global_Sales" column from the data. Also, add a separate histogram
  for visualizing the distribution of video game releases by year, using the "Year"
  column. Make sure to label the axes clearly and provide appropriate titles for the
  histograms. The charts should help in understanding trends in global sales and the
  number of game releases over time.
questions: '1. What bin size or range would you prefer for the histograms?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the histograms?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like for the titles and
  axis labels?

  4. Should there be any annotations or data labels on the histograms for additional
  clarity?

  5. Would you like any specific grid lines or background styles to be included in
  the charts?

  6. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the global sales brackets in the histogram?

  7. Is there a particular way you want the years to be grouped in the histogram (e.g.,
  by decade, by five-year intervals)?

  8. Do you want any specific highlights or markers for significant events or trends
  within the histograms?'
