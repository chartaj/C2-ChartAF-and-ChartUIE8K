initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot illustrating video game sales data. Each point
  should represent a video game, with 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Global_Sales' on the
  y-axis. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight the top 3 games with the highest
  global sales. These annotations should display the game name and sales figures.
  Highlight data points for Nintendo-published games in a different color to distinguish
  them from others. This visualization will help analyze trends over time and highlight
  top-selling games and publishers in the video game industry.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the data points representing
  Nintendo-published games?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the other data points?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size of the data points?

  4. How would you like the top 3 games with the highest global sales to be highlighted?
  Specific color or shape?

  5. Do you prefer the text annotations to be positioned in a particular way relative
  to the data points?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart? If so, where should it be
  positioned?

  7. Should the axis labels have a specific font size or style?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot? If yes, should they be for both x
  and y axes or just one?'
