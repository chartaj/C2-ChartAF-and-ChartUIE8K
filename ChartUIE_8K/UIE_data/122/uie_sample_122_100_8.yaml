initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart visualizing global video game sales
  data from the provided dataset. The x-axis should represent the different game titles,
  while the y-axis should show the sales figures. Each game title should have grouped
  bars representing sales in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions. Additionally,
  include global sales as another grouped bar for each title. Make sure the chart
  is colorful and easy to read, with a legend indicating the regions. Include the
  top five games based on global sales for clearer comparison.
