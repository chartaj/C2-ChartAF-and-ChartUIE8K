initial_prompt: I need a histogram using data from the Hotels in India Dataset (2023).
  Please create a histogram to show the distribution of total rooms available across
  different hotels. The x-axis should represent the number of rooms in bins, and the
  y-axis should show the frequency of hotels falling into each bin. This will help
  visualize how room availability varies among different hotels in diverse states
  and cities. Also, please ensure to label the axes appropriately for clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins on the x-axis?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for the bars in the histogram?

  4. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Do you want gridlines displayed in the background of the histogram?

  6. Do you need any annotations or labels on the bars themselves?

  7. Should the histogram include a legend, even if it''s only representing one data
  attribute?

  8. Would you like to display the data values along with the y-axis frequency?

  9. Is there a specific way you prefer the axes to be scaled (e.g., logarithmic)?

  10. Do you have any preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
