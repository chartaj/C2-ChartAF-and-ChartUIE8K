initial_prompt: <start of the annotation list> Create a Choropleth map of India showing
  hotel distribution per state. Use color gradients to represent the number of hotels
  per state, highlighting states with the most hotels in darker shades. Include data-driven
  text annotations for states with the highest and lowest number of hotels. Highlight
  the top five cities with the most hotels on the map. Provide context about the alcohol
  availability column, specifying that many entries have missing values. The map will
  help identify geographic patterns in hotel spread and show regional differences.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  to use for the color gradient on the Choropleth map?

  2. Should the color gradient be simple (e.g., shades of a single color) or more
  complex (e.g., a multi-color gradient)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular type of text annotation style for states with the
  highest and lowest number of hotels (e.g., font size, font color, or background
  color)?

  4. How would you like the top five cities with the most hotels to be highlighted
  on the map (e.g., markers, icons, or different color)?

  5. Would you like the map to include a legend explaining the color gradient and
  other visual elements?

  6. Is there any specific format or placement for the context about the alcohol availability
  column and missing values?

  7. Do you have preferences for the overall layout or orientation of the map (e.g.,
  portrait or landscape)?

  8. Should the map display additional geographic features (e.g., rivers, mountains)
  to provide more context?'
