initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the total number of hotel rooms across
  different cities in India for each state. Use the "State" column for the x-axis,
  the "Total Rooms" column for the y-axis, and color-code the dots by the "City" column.
  This will help identify which states have more hotel rooms and see the distribution
  of rooms among different cities within each state. Include a legend for the cities
  and ensure the plot is clear and easy to interpret. Use data from the Hotels in
  India Dataset (2023).
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the city dots?

  2. Would you like the dots to be different shapes based on any specific criteria
  (e.g., hotel category)?

  3. Should the x-axis have any specific ordering (alphabetical or by number of rooms)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines to make it easier to read the plot?

  6. Do you have a preferred way of displaying the legend (e.g., location, size)?

  7. Should any specific states or cities be highlighted in the chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred size for the dots based on any additional attribute,
  like "Category" or "Hotel Name"?

  9. Would you prefer the axes labels to be horizontal or vertical?

  10. Do you want any annotations or markers for specific data points?'
