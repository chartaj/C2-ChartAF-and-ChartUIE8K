initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the distribution of hotels in India
  by state and city. Use color intensity to represent the number of hotels in each
  city within a given state. Include categories, but emphasize states and cities.
  Exclude the Alcohol column, but ensure key details like Hotel Name, Address, and
  Room Counts are accounted for. Use unique colors for different states to make it
  visually appealing. Ensure the heatmap helps identify hotspots for hotels across
  India. Including start and expiry dates in tooltips would add value by showing the
  license validity period. Please ensure it's intuitive and comprehensive.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used in
  the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer a specific layout for the heatmap (e.g., grid size)?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  tooltips?

  4. Would you like the cities and states to be sorted in a specific order?

  5. Do you have any preference for the threshold of color intensity representing
  different ranges of hotel counts?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color intensities?

  7. Are there any specific label formats you prefer for the start and expiry dates
  in the tooltips?

  8. Do you have any preference for how detailed the tooltips should be (e.g., how
  much information to display)?'
