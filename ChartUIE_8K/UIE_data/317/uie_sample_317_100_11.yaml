initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of hotel categories
  across different cities from the provided Hotels in India dataset (2023). Focus
  on showcasing the variability and concentration of total rooms within each category.
  Highlight any outliers and ensure the cities are clearly labeled for better understanding.
  The chart should also include a comparison between cities with and without listed
  alcohol availability, and highlight the number of unique hotels. Ensure the start
  and expiry dates are not included as they are not relevant for this visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to display the number of unique hotels as an additional label
  or annotation on the chart?

  3. How would you prefer the categories within the cities to be ordered (e.g., alphabetically,
  by the number of rooms, etc.)?

  4. Should the outliers be highlighted with a specific shape or color? If yes, do
  you have any preference?

  5. Do you want any specific font styles or sizes for the city labels and category
  labels?

  6. Would you like a legend that distinguishes cities with and without alcohol availability
  through a specific marker or color?

  7. Should the box charts for cities be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart to emphasize certain points or findings?

  10. Do you have a preference for the overall layout (e.g., single chart or multiple
  subplots for each city)?'
