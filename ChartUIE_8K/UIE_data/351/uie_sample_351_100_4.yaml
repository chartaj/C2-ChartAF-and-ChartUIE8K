initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the relationship between game
  platforms and genres based on their global sales. Use the "Platform," "Genre," and
  "Global_Sales" columns from the dataset "Global Video Game Sales and Ratings." The
  heatmap should help identify which gaming platforms are most successful for specific
  genres in terms of sales. The colors in the heatmap should represent sales values
  to highlight the intensity of sales performance where platforms and genres intersect.
  Ensure the visual is clear and provides insights into sales distribution across
  different combinations of platforms and genres.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations on the heatmap for better clarity?

  3. Should the color intensity follow a linear or logarithmic scale?

  4. Do you have any preference for the layout of the heatmap, such as aspect ratio
  or size?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or color bar to indicate sales values?

  6. Are there any specific platforms or genres you want to highlight or focus on?

  7. Should the heatmap include grid lines to separate different genres and platforms?

  8. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and annotations
  on the heatmap?'
