initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap showcasing the correlation between different
  numerical features like NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, and Global_Sales along with
  Critic_Score and User_Score from the provided dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include numerical values within the cells of the heatmap for
  precise correlations?

  3. Do you have any preferences regarding the color gradient (e.g., blue to red,
  green to yellow) for the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include axis labels and/or a legend explaining the correlation
  values?

  5. Would you like to apply any specific threshold for highlighting strong correlations
  (e.g., only show correlations above 0.7 or below -0.7)?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., hierarchical
  clustering)?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to see on the heatmap?

  8. Do you have any preferences on the size or resolution of the heatmap for presentations
  or reports?'
