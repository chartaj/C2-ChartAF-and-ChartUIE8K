initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart illustrating the distribution of game genres
  from the global video game sales dataset. Highlight the genre with the highest sales
  using a distinct color and include text annotations for each genre's proportion.
  Ensure the chart is visually appealing and easy to interpret. Use the data for "Genre"
  and "Global_Sales" to reflect this information. This visualization aims to provide
  a clear insight into the popularity of various game genres, helping to focus on
  market trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Is there a specific format for the text annotations you would like to use?

  3. Would you like to include a legend in the pie chart, or should the genre names
  be directly labeled on the slices?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations to maintain consistency
  with other visualizations?

  5. Should the pie chart include percentage values, raw sales numbers, or both in
  the annotations?

  6. Is there a specific style (e.g., 2D or 3D) you prefer for the pie chart?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a title? If so, what would you like it to
  be?

  8. Are there any specific elements you would like to highlight in the chart aside
  from the genre with the highest sales?'
