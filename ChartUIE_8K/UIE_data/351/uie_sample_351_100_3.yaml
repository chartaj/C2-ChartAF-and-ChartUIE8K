initial_prompt: I want to visualize the global video game sales and ratings data with
  a box chart for better insights. Could you please create a box chart that highlights
  the distribution of sales across different platforms, genres, and years of release?
  Additionally, include the ratings (both critic and user scores) to show how they
  correlate with sales. Make sure to include labels on both axes and a legend to differentiate
  the categories clearly. This will help me understand the sales trends and ratings
  in the video game industry more effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the box chart?

  2. Would you prefer the data to be grouped by platform, genre, or year of release
  on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want to show outliers in the box chart?

  4. Should the legend include color differentiations for different platforms, genres,
  or years of release?

  5. Do you have any specific labels or titles for the x and y axes?

  6. Are there any specific platforms, genres, or years you want to highlight or focus
  on?

  7. Do you prefer any specific style or font for the text labels and legends?'
