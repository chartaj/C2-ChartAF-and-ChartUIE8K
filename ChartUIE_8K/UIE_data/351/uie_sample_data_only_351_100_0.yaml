  1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the format for text annotations.

  3. I would like the genre names to be directly labeled on the slices.

  4. I do not have a specific font style or size in mind.

  5. Both percentage values and raw sales numbers would be good.

  6. I have no specific preference for the style.

  7. Yes, please include a title. The title can be "Global Video Game Sales by Genre".

  8. No, just highlighting the genre with the highest sales is enough.
