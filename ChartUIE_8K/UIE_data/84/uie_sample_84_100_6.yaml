initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the water quality data. The
  x-axis should indicate different water quality parameters like pH, Hardness, Solids,
  Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and Turbidity.
  The y-axis should represent the average values of these parameters. Show different
  colors for potable and non-potable water to distinguish them easily. Include labels,
  a title, and a legend to help understand the chart better. Make sure to account
  for missing values intelligently in your visualization. This will help us understand
  the overall water quality trends in our dataset.
questions: '1. What color preferences do you have for distinguishing potable and non-potable
  water?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and legends?

  4. How would you like to handle missing values in the visualization?

  5. Do you have a preference for the axis label orientation (horizontal/vertical)?

  6. Would you like any specific gridlines or background color for the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like on the chart?

  9. Would you like to include error bars or confidence intervals for the averages?

  10. Do you prefer specific dimensions or aspect ratios for the bar chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Please handle missing values by calculating the average of the available data.

  5. Horizontal orientation for axis labels would be fine.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Bottom layout for the legend would be great.

  8. No additional annotations or markers are needed.

  9. No need to include error bars or confidence intervals.

  10. I do not know.'
