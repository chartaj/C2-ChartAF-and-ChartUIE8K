initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize Water Quality data over time.
  Focus on variables like pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, and Sulfate to show trends
  and inconsistencies. Highlight missing values for clarity. Annotate notable peaks
  and troughs to emphasize significant changes. Ensure the potability status is also
  represented. The intent is to understand fluctuations and identify potential water
  quality issues.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Should each variable have a different line style (e.g., solid, dashed) or color?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be indicated on the chart?

  4. Do you have a specific format for annotating notable peaks and troughs?

  5. Is there a preferred way to represent potability status on the chart?

  6. Should the x-axis be formatted in a particular way (e.g., date format)?

  7. Would you like a legend to identify the different variables?

  8. Do you have specific axis labels or chart title in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Each variable having a different color would be good.

  3. I''m not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific format in mind.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, the x-axis should be formatted as dates.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful to identify the different variables.

  8. No, I do not have specific axis labels or a chart title in mind.'
