initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the water quality data. Highlight missing
  values for columns like 'ph' and 'Sulfate', and use text annotations to display
  unique values. Color-code each cell based on 'Potability' to differentiate potable
  and non-potable water. Display the data types and emphasize missing values with
  highlights to capture the viewer's attention for better data quality assessment
  and energy analysis. This will help in identifying which areas have incomplete data
  and need attention for better water quality management. Show sample data points
  for context and clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for highlighting missing values and
  representing different potability statuses (potable vs non-potable)?

  2. Would you prefer a specific scale or gradient for the heatmap colors?

  3. Should the annotations display the full unique value or can they be abbreviated?

  4. Do you want any specific format or style for the text annotations?

  5. Is there a preferred label or legend setup for better readability and understanding
  of the chart?

  6. Do you need any additional markers or indicators other than highlights for missing
  values?

  7. Should the sample data points be displayed in a specific format or area on the
  chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines or cell borders on the heatmap
  for better visual clarity?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or notes directly
  on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. The annotations can display the full unique values.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the text annotations style.

  5. I prefer a clear and concise label or legend setup for readability.

  6. I do not know.

  7. The sample data points should be displayed clearly alongside the heatmap.

  8. I do not have any specific preference for the gridlines or cell borders.

  9. I do not know.'
