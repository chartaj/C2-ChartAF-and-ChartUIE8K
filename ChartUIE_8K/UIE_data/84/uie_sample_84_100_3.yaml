initial_prompt: I have a dataset on water quality. I need a box plot to visualize
  the distribution and range of different water quality parameters like pH, Hardness,
  Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, and
  Turbidity. The y-axis should represent the values of these parameters, while the
  x-axis should list each parameter. Make sure to handle missing values appropriately
  and include data points for each category. The goal is to easily see the variability
  and any potential outliers in the water quality attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plot?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations for outliers?

  3. Should the box plot include notches to show the confidence interval around the
  median?

  4. How would you like the missing values to be handled (e.g., removal, substitution)?

  5. Do you have any specific range or scale preferences for the y-axis?

  6. Would you prefer horizontal or vertical box plots?

  7. Should the box plot include a mean marker within each category?

  8. Do you want gridlines or a specific background for the plot?

  9. Are there any specific legends or titles you would like to include on the chart?

  10. Would you like the data points to be jittered for better visibility?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include notches to show the confidence interval around the median.

  4. Please remove the missing values.

  5. I do not have any specific range or scale preferences for the y-axis.

  6. I would prefer vertical box plots.

  7. Yes, please include a mean marker within each category.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No specific legends or titles are needed.

  10. Yes, jitter the data points for better visibility.'
