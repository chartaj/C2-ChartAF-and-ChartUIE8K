initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that shows the count of missing values for
  each column in the water quality data. I want to visualize how data completeness
  varies across different water quality parameters.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be labeled with the exact count of missing values?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for easier interpretation of the values?

  5. Do you want a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you require axis labels? If so, what should the labels for the X and Y axes
  be?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  8. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the chart?'
