initial_prompt: 'I need a histogram using the provided water quality data. Please
  create separate histograms for each of the numeric columns: ''ph'', ''Hardness'',
  ''Solids'', ''Chloramines'', ''Sulfate'', ''Conductivity'', ''Organic_carbon'',
  ''Trihalomethanes'', and ''Turbidity''. Each histogram should show the distribution
  of values and include appropriate labels for the axes. Make sure to handle missing
  values gracefully, perhaps removing or filling them before plotting. An additional
  histogram for ''Potability'' should show the frequency of potable vs non-potable
  water instances. The goal is to visualize water quality characteristics clearly.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. How would you like us to handle missing values? Should we fill them in with the
  mean/median or simply remove them?

  3. What labels would you like on the x-axes and y-axes?

  4. Do you have a specific bin size or number of bins in mind for the histograms?

  5. Would you like the histograms to be displayed separately or as a part of a single
  multi-panel figure?

  6. Should there be any annotations or markers on the histograms to highlight specific
  values or ranges?

  7. Do you want the frequency counts on the y-axes to be displayed in absolute numbers
  or percentages?

  8. Are there any particular text fonts or sizes you prefer for axis labels, titles,
  or other texts in the charts?

  9. Would you like legend information on the histogram for ''Potability'' to differentiate
  potable vs non-potable water instances?

  10. Should the background of the histograms be plain or with grid lines?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Please fill in missing values with the mean.

  3. For labels, use the column name for the x-axis and "Frequency" for the y-axis.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I don''t have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Absolute numbers, please.

  8. I do not have any specific preference.

  9. Yes, include legend information for ''Potability''.

  10. Plain background.'
