initial_prompt: Create a line chart displaying Spotify's subscribers and non-subscribers
  from 2015 to 2020. Use different colors for each group to distinguish them. Include
  text annotations highlighting significant milestones (e.g., the highest and lowest
  points in subscribers and non-subscribers). Add a title, axes labels, and a legend
  for clarity. The chart should help visualize the growth trends and compare subscribers
  against non-subscribers over time, emphasizing key changes or notable periods in
  user growth dynamics for better insight into Spotify's market performance.
questions: '1. What specific title would you prefer for the chart?

  2. Do you have any preference for the colors used to represent subscribers and non-subscribers?

  3. Should the x-axis represent each year (2015-2020) as individual points or aggregated
  in a specific way (e.g., quarters)?

  4. Do you have any specific milestones or events to highlight with text annotations
  apart from the highest and lowest points?

  5. What style of text annotations do you prefer (e.g., bold, italic, colored)?

  6. Should the y-axis show the data in absolute numbers, or would you prefer percentages
  or another format?

  7. Where should the legend be placed on the chart (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)?

  8. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the title, axes labels,
  and legend?

  9. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better visual alignment, and if so, in
  which style?'
answers: '1. The title could be "Spotify Subscribers and Non-Subscribers Growth (2015-2020)".

  2. I am not sure about the specific colors; maybe one bright color for subscribers
  and a contrasting color for non-subscribers?

  3. I do not know.

  4. No specific milestones or events come to mind apart from the highest and lowest
  points.

  5. I am not sure, maybe just something easily readable.

  6. Absolute numbers would be great.

  7. The legend could be placed at the top.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.
