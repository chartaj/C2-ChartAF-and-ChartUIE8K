initial_prompt: 'Please create an area chart to visualize the data on Spotify users
  and subscriber growth over the period from 2015 to 2020, divided by quartals. The
  chart should have the x-axis representing quartals, labeled as ''2015-Q1'', ''2015-Q2'',
  etc., and the y-axis representing the number of users in millions. The chart should
  have three areas: one for subscribers, one for non-subscribers, and one for the
  total number of users. Differentiate the areas with distinct colors and include
  a legend. This way, we can easily see the trends and compare subscribers versus
  non-subscribers.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for the areas representing
  subscribers, non-subscribers, and the total number of users?

  2. Would you like to include specific grid lines or tick marks on the x-axis or
  y-axis for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart title and axis titles be styled in a specific way?

  5. Would you like the data values to be displayed on the chart for each quartal
  or data point?

  6. How detailed should the legend be (e.g., include total, subscribers, and non-subscribers
  counts)?

  7. Would you like any annotations or specific markers for significant data points
  or trends?

  (such as rotation or alignment)?'
