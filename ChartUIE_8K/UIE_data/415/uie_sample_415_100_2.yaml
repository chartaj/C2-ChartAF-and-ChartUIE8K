initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart to compare Spotify users, subscribers,
  and non-subscribers from 2015 to 2020 based on quarterly data. Highlight differences
  between subscribers and non-subscribers. Use data-driven annotations to show exact
  subscriber and user counts for each quarter. Provide non-data annotations to contextualize
  Spotify's growth trends and emphasize key periods. Make sure the visualization clearly
  shows the changes in user and subscriber numbers over the years, drawing attention
  to how subscriber rates contribute to overall user numbers. Tailor the colors and
  visual elements for intuitive understanding.
