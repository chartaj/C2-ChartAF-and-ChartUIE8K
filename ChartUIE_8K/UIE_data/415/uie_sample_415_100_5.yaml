initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing Spotify users, subscribers,
  and non-subscribers over different quarters from 2015 to 2020. The x-axis should
  represent the "step" (e.g., 2015-Q1, 2015-Q2), and the y-axis should show the count
  in millions. Each quarter should have three columns representing "subscribers,"
  "users," and "non_subscribers" for comparison. Include a legend to differentiate
  between these three categories. Make sure the chart is clear, with distinct colors
  for each column and properly labeled axes. This will help in analyzing user trends
  over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the columns representing ''subscribers,''
  ''users,'' and ''non_subscribers''?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on top of each column to show exact values?

  3. Should the y-axis have a specific range, or is an auto-scaling option acceptable?

  4. Are there any specific font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart to enhance readability?

  6. Is there a need for annotations or highlighted sections to mark important trends
  or events?

  7. Would you like any specific formatting for the ''step'' labels on the x-axis
  (e.g., rotated, bold)?'
