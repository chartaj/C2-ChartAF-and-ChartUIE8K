initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'temp_max'
  and 'temp_min'. Color code the points based on the 'weather' categories. Ensure
  the x-axis represents 'temp_min' and the y-axis represents 'temp_max'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  between different ''weather'' categories?

  2. Would you like to add gridlines to your scatter plot?

  3. Do you want to include a title for the scatter plot? If so, please specify the
  title.

  4. Is there a specific label format you want for the axes?

  5. Do you prefer data point symbols to be different shapes for different ''weather''
  categories in addition to color coding?

  6. Should the size of the data points be uniform, or do you want to encode another
  variable (e.g., wind speed) using point size?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for the ''weather''
  categories?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or text you would like to add to highlight
  certain data points or trends?'
