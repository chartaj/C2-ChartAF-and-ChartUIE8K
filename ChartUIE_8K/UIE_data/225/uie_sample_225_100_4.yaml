initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the given weather data.
  The x-axis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should show the precipitation,
  temp_max, temp_min, and wind, each as separate lines. I'm especially interested
  in tracking how these variables change over time. Make sure each line is clearly
  distinguishable with different colors and a legend to identify them. The goal is
  to help analyze the weather trends from this dataset, which will be useful for weather
  prediction purposes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme of the lines?

  2. What style or format do you prefer for the legend?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Any specific font style or size?

  4. Is there a preferred range or scale for the y-axis values?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, any specific style?

  6. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines? If so, any specific marker
  style?

  7. Do you prefer the chart background to have a particular color or pattern?

  8. Should there be any annotations, such as important dates or weather events, highlighted
  on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like for the chart?

  10. Do you want any specific margin or padding settings around the chart?

  11. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  12. Do you have a preferred line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  13. Would you like to include a trendline or moving average line for any of the
  variables?'
