initial_prompt: Create a line chart depicting weather patterns over time using the
  precipitation, temp_max, temp_min, and wind columns from the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to display all four weather attributes (precipitation, temp_max,
  temp_min, and wind) on one combined line chart, or would you prefer separate line
  charts for each attribute?

  3. Should the x-axis be labeled with specific intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be included on the chart?

  5. Should the y-axis scale be the same for all attributes, or should each attribute
  have its own scale?

  6. Would you like to add data points to the lines to highlight specific values?

  7. Do you prefer any specific type of line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the different attributes?

  9. Would you like to include annotations or markers for significant events or outliers
  in the data?
