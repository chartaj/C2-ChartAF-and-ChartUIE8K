initial_prompt: Create a heatmap displaying the correlation between weather parameters
  over time. Highlight areas with significant precipitation, temperature variations,
  and wind speed. Annotate specific dates where weather patterns such as 'drizzle'
  and 'rain' were observed. This should help identify trends and anomalies in weather
  conditions throughout the year. Ensure the heatmap effectively emphasizes unique
  and recurring weather events for better predictive insights and decision-making
  related to weather forecasts. Visualizing this will aid in understanding the interaction
  between different weather elements and their seasonal impact.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap display a particular time granularity (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  3. Are there specific thresholds for precipitation, temperature variations, and
  wind speed that you want to highlight?

  4. Would you like the annotated dates for weather patterns (''drizzle'', ''rain'')
  to have specific markers or colors?

  5. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., chronological
  order, grouped by seasons)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend or specific labels for better interpretability?

  7. Are there any additional weather parameters you would like to include or exclude
  from the visualization?

  8. Do you have preferences for the font style or size for annotations and labels
  on the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to see any trend lines or additional statistical indicators (e.g.,
  average lines) overlaid on the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Daily would be ideal.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, specific markers or colors would be great for the annotated dates.

  5. Chronological order sounds good.

  6. Yes, please include a legend or specific labels.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for additional weather parameters.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.'
