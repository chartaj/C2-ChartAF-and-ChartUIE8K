initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the popularity of different obstacle
  courses across various locations and seasons in Ninja Warrior. Use 'location' on
  the y-axis and 'season' on the x-axis. The intensity of the heatmap should indicate
  the frequency of different 'obstacle_names' appearing in each 'round_stage' and
  'obstacle_order' should be taken into account. This will help identify which obstacles
  are most commonly featured in each location over the seasons. Ensure the heatmap
  is color-coded to easily distinguish the frequency of occurrence.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the heatmap?

  2. What range of color intensity would be most effective for distinguishing frequencies?

  3. Do you prefer any specific label formatting or font style on the axes?

  4. Would you like to include axis titles and/or gridlines for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include annotations on cells to display frequency values explicitly?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like to handle the display of zero frequencies
  or missing data?

  8. Would you prefer a specific ordering for the locations and/or seasons other than
  alphabetical or chronological?'

  1. I do not have a specific color palette in mind.

  2. I am not sure about the range of color intensity, whatever you think is best.

  3. I have no specific preference for label formatting or font style on the axes.

  4. Yes, including axis titles and gridlines would be great for better readability.

  5. I do not have a preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap.

  6. Yes, it would be helpful to include annotations on cells to display frequency
  values explicitly.

  7. I am not sure how to handle zero frequencies or missing data.

  8. No specific ordering preference other than alphabetical for locations and chronological
