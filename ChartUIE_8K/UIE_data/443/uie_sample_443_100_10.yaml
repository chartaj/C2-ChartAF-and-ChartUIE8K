initial_prompt: 'Please create a radar chart to visualize the performance data of
  obstacles in the Ninja Warrior seasons. Each axis should represent one of the attributes:
  season, location, round_stage, obstacle_name, and obstacle_order. I am interested
  in seeing how these attributes differ across various obstacles and stages. The chart
  should display data distribution and highlight any notable patterns or anomalies
  among the different obstacles. Make sure to include markers and labels for better
  clarity and understanding. Ideally, the chart should help in comparing the difficulty
  and frequency of each obstacle in different seasons and locations.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the radar chart?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled (e.g., font size, font style)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific markers for the data points (e.g., circles, triangles)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  5. Are there any specific line styles you prefer for connecting the data points
  (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  6. Would you like any specific gridlines to be highlighted?

  7. Is there a particular order in which you want the axes to be arranged?

  8. Do you have any preference for the scale or range of each axis?

  9. Should the chart include titles or subtitles, and if so, what should they be?

  10. Are there any specific data points or categories you want to be emphasized or
  highlighted on the chart?'
