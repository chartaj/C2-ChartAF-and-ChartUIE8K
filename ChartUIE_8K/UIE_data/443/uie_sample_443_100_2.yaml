initial_prompt: Create a histogram that visualizes the frequency of obstacles encountered
  in different seasons of Ninja Warrior games. The x-axis should list the obstacle
  names, and the y-axis should show the number of occurrences of each obstacle. Use
  text annotations to highlight key obstacles that frequently appear across multiple
  seasons. Add some visual highlights to memorable obstacles like 'Quintuple Steps,'
  'Rope Swing,' and 'Rolling Barrel' to make them stand out. This chart should help
  understand which obstacles are most common and their distribution across various
  stages and locations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histogram bars?

  2. Would you like the colors of the highlighted obstacles to be distinct from other
  obstacles? If yes, please specify the colors.

  4. Do you have a preferred style for the chart title and axis labels?

  dark, light, classic)?

  8. Would you like any specific margin or padding settings around the histogram?'
