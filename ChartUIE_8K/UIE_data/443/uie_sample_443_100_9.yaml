initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the progression of obstacle courses
  over different seasons in Ninja Warrior games. The x-axis should represent the seasons,
  and the y-axis should show each obstacle type's appearance, with different lines
  for each location and round stage. This will help identify trends in the usage of
  specific obstacles over time. Please incorporate color coding for various locations
  and round stages for easier interpretation. The chart should help us understand
  how obstacle course configurations evolved season by season across different venues
  and competition stages.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the line style or thickness in the
  chart?

  2. What specific color schemes or palettes would you like to use for different locations
  and round stages?

  3. Should there be any specific markers for data points on the lines, such as circles
  or squares?

  4. Would you like to display any grid lines on the chart for better readability?
  If so, should they be dotted or solid?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on certain data
  points or trends?

  6. How should the legend be positioned or styled in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any reference lines or bands to highlight specific
  seasons or stages?

  8. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want to include for the chart
  and axes?

  9. Should the axes be in a linear or logarithmic scale?

  10. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text elements in the chart?'
