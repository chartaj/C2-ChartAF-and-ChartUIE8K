initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of unique obstacle
  names encountered in different seasons of the Ninja Warrior games. The chart should
  display the percentage of obstacles used in each of the 10 seasons, highlighting
  the variety and frequency of obstacle courses. Use different colors to represent
  each season and ensure the chart is clearly labeled for better understanding. The
  chart should provide insights into the most common obstacles and how frequently
  they appear across different stages and locations in the data provided.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to represent
  each season?

  2. How would you like the labels to be displayed on the chart (inside the donut
  slices, outside, or in a legend)?

  3. What style of font and font size would you prefer for the labels and titles?

  4. Should the chart include information on the number of occurrences of each obstacle
  name in addition to the percentage?

  5. Do you have preferences for the background color or the overall theme (light,
  dark, neutral, etc.) of the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers to highlight
  certain data points or trends?

  7. Do you prefer a specific arrangement for the order of the seasons around the
  donut chart (chronological, most frequent to least frequent, etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what text would you like
  these to display?'
