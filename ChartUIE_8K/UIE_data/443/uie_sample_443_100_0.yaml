initial_prompt: Create a treemap chart visualizing the data to show the distribution
  of obstacles used in different locations and stages of the Ninja Warrior games across
  seasons. Annotate the map with obstacle names, highlighting frequently used obstacles
  and differentiating them by color based on their order within the course. This will
  help in identifying the diversity and prevalence of obstacles in various game settings,
  and highlight the prominence or uniqueness of certain obstacles. The annotations
  should help viewers quickly grasp which obstacles are most significant in different
  contexts, aiding in strategic analysis and course planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different obstacle orders
  within the course?

  2. How would you prefer the frequently used obstacles to be highlighted? (e.g.,
  bold text, larger font size, different color)

  3. Should the annotations for obstacle names include any additional information,
  such as the frequency of use or the stage of the game?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size requirements for the annotations?

  5. Are there any particular color schemes or palettes that should be avoided or
  preferred for the chart?

  6. Should the seasons be represented differently in the chart, and if so, how?

  7. Are there any specific locations or stages that you want to be emphasized more
  prominently in the chart?'
