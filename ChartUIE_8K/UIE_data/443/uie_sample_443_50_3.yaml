initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the frequency of obstacles per round stage
  for different locations and seasons. Use obstacle_name as the primary axis, and
  categorize by round_stage and location to observe trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer a sequential or diverging color scale?

  3. Do you want to include annotations in the cells to show the exact frequency values?

  4. Should the heatmap display only the top or most frequent obstacles, or include
  all obstacle names?

  5. Do you want to add any labels or titles to the axes and heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend for better understanding of the color scale?

  7. Would you like to apply any specific clustering or ordering for the rows (obstacle
  names) and columns (round stages and locations)?

  8. Is there any preferred layout for the categorization by ''round_stage'' and ''location''
  - side-by-side or stacked?

  9. Do you need any specific information or captions to be added to the heatmap for
  better context?

  10. Should the seasons be represented in any specific order (chronological or custom)?'
