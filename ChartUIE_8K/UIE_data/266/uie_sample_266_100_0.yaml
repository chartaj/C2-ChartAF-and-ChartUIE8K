initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between concrete
  compressive strength (csMPa) and the age of the concrete samples. Use different
  colors to highlight the data points for various ages. Provide text annotations for
  specific data points, particularly the highest and lowest csMPa values, to draw
  focus. The purpose of this plot is to help urban planners visualize how concrete
  strength develops over time, which is crucial for infrastructure projects. The chart
  should be clear and easy to read, with the x-axis representing the age in days and
  the y-axis showing the compressive strength in MPa.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  highlight different ages of the concrete samples?

  2. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be both horizontal and
  vertical?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for text annotations and
  axis labels?

  4. Do you want the legend to be displayed on the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for its location?

  5. Should the chart have a title? If yes, do you have a preferred title in mind?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the marker style (e.g., circles, squares)
  in the scatter plot?

  7. How would you like the axes to be labeled specifically? Would you like any additional
  information included in the labels?

  8. Is there a specific background color preference for the chart area or the entire
  plot?

  9. Should the axes have fixed scales, or should they adjust based on the data range?

  10. Would you prefer data point annotations to be displayed always or only upon
  hovering/clicking?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, gridlines would be helpful. Both horizontal and vertical.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please display the legend. I have no specific preference for its location.

  5. Yes, "Concrete Strength Development Over Time".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. X-axis: "Age (days)", Y-axis: "Compressive Strength (MPa)"

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. The axes should adjust based on the data range.

  10. I would prefer data point annotations to be displayed always.
