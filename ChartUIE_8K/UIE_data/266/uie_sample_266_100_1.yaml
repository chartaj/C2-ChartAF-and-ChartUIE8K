initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'csMPa'
  values, representing the concrete compressive strength data. Use text annotations
  to highlight key data points, such as the maximum and minimum strength values. Additionally,
  apply highlights to distinguish data points from different ages to show the variation
  in concrete strength over time. This visualization is intended to support urban
  planning decisions by illustrating the variability and reliability of concrete strength
  for different compositions and curing periods. Add text annotations to provide context
  about the different materials used, like cement and slag, in the samples.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the different
  ages of the concrete samples?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the different age group highlights?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for how the text annotations should look
  (e.g., font size, color, background)?

  4. Would you like the maximum and minimum strength values to be highlighted in a
  specific color?

  5. Is there a particular format in which you would like the context about the different
  materials (like cement, slag) to be displayed?

  6. Are there any specific age ranges or groupings you want to focus on for highlighting
  the data points?

  7. Do you have any preference for the ordering of the box plots (e.g., by age, by
  strength values)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, please highlight the maximum and minimum strength values in red.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
