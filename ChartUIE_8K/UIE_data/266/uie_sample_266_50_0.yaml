  4. Is there a specific range you want to set for the axes (cement, water, csMPa)?

  5. Do you have preferences for the shape or size of the scatter plot markers?

  6. Should a trend line be included in the scatter plot, and if so, what type (linear,
  polynomial, etc.)?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the plot, and if so, do you have a preference on their
