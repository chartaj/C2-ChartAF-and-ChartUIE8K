initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the relationship between different
  concrete mixture components (cement, slag, flyash, water, etc.) and compressive
  strength (csMPa). Use text annotations to highlight unique data points and apply
  color highlights for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme or palette to
  use in the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted? Do you prefer certain

  3. Should the unique data points highlighted with text annotations also have specific
  color highlights or markers?

  4. Would you like the bars in the chart to be grouped or stacked by different concrete
  mixture components, or displayed side by side?

  5. Do you want a legend included in the chart to distinguish different concrete
  mixture components?

  6. Do you have a preference for the axis labels, including font size or style?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines or a background to enhance readability?

  8. Do you prefer any specific type of title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Is there a particular order you would like the concrete mixture components to
  appear in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any specific source information or footnotes in the
  chart?'
