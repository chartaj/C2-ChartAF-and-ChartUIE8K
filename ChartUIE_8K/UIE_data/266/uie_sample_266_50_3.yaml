initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the concrete compressive strength
  ('csMPa') over different ages ('age'). Use cement, slag, flyash, water, superplasticizer,
  coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate as segmented lines in the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the segmented
  lines representing different materials?

  2. Should the chart include markers on the data points for better visibility, or
  would you prefer smooth lines?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between the various materials?

  4. Would you like to have grid lines in the chart to enhance readability?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to include on the
  chart (e.g., highlighting key ages or compressive strengths)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale type of the axes (linear, logarithmic,
  etc.)?

  7. Would you like to include a title and axis labels for better context and understanding?

  8. Should the chart have any specific size or aspect ratio?

  9. Is there a need for including error bars or confidence intervals for more detailed
  analysis?

  10. Are there any specific guidelines or standards that the chart should adhere
  to for your audience?'
