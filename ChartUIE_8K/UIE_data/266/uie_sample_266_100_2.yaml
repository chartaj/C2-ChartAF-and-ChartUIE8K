initial_prompt: Create a bar chart from the concrete strength dataset to visualize
  the average compressive strength (csMPa) at different ages. Highlight the bars representing
  the ages 28 and 270 days for emphasis. Add text annotations showing the exact csMPa
  values for these bars. This chart will help in understanding how concrete strength
  develops over time, important for urban planning and construction decisions. Make
  sure the x-axis represents the age in days and the y-axis represents the compressive
  strength in MPa. Provide a title that reflects the relevance to concrete strength
  and urban planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for highlighting the bars representing
  the ages 28 and 270 days?

  2. What specific font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations showing
  the exact csMPa values?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart? If so, should they be
  for both axes or just one?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the chart title''s font style, size, and color?

  5. Should the bars be displayed with any specific style, such as with borders or
  gradient fills?

  6. Would you like to include any additional labels or legends to further clarify
  the data?

  7. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the x-axis (age) and the y-axis
  (compressive strength in MPa)?

  8. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., should the y-axis show every potential
  compressive strength value or only specific intervals)?

  9. Do you prefer a specific alignment or angle for the x-axis labels to enhance
  readability?'
