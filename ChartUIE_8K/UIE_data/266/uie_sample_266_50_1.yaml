initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of concrete compressive
  strength (csMPa) against age. Highlight the median values and annotate significant
  data points for csMPa.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box plot?

  2. Would you like the age axis to be logarithmic or linear?

  3. Do you prefer any specific annotations for the significant data points (e.g.,
  symbols, texts)?

  4. How would you like the median values to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  bold line, etc.)?

  5. Should the whiskers of the box plot represent all data points, percentiles, or
  adjustable parameters?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labels or titles for the axes and the plot?

  8. Should outliers be marked in a specific way, or follow the standard box plot
  convention?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical information (e.g., mean, standard deviation)
  to be displayed on the plot?

  10. Is there a preferred style for the box and whisker elements (e.g., dashed lines,
  solid lines)?'
