initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing Malaria death rates from 1990
  to 2016 globally. Highlight changes over time for each country and use color codes
  for different years. Annotate key years with the highest and lowest death rates.
  The purpose is to understand trends and identify critical periods for targeted interventions.
  The chart should focus on overall changes and specific anomalies in the data. Include
  a legend for clarity. Use text annotations and highlights to emphasize significant
  data points.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for specific color codes to represent different\
  \ years?\n2. Would you like a specific color scheme for highlighting key years with\
  \ the highest and lowest death rates?\n3. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical stacked\
  \ bar charts?\n4. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for text\
  \ annotations?\n5. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart\
  \ (e.g., top, right, bottom)?\n6. Are there specific countries you want to focus\
  \ on or highlight in the chart?\n7. How detailed should the annotations be for the\
  \ key years with significant changes? \n8. Do you prefer any specific chart title\
  \ or axis labels?"

  1. I do not have any specific preference for color codes to represent different
  years.

  2. I am not sure about the color scheme for highlighting key years with the highest
  and lowest death rates.

  3. I prefer vertical stacked bar charts.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the font style and size for text annotations.

  5. The legend can be placed at the bottom of the chart.

  6. I do not know if there are specific countries to focus on or highlight in the
