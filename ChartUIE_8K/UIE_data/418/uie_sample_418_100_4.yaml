initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the age-standardized malaria death
  rates per 100,000 people from 1990 to 2016. Use the ''Entity'' column for identifying
  countries on the x-axis and the ''Deaths - Malaria - Sex: Both - Age: Age-standardized
  (Rate) (per 100,000 people)'' column for the y-axis. Highlight data for notable
  years and countries to show trends or outliers in malaria death rates. Ensure the
  plot is clear and labeled for health data analysis purposes. Use different colors
