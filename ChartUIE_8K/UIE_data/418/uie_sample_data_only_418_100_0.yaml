  1. I do not have any specific preference for color codes to represent different
  years.

  2. I am not sure about the color scheme for highlighting key years with the highest
  and lowest death rates.

  3. I prefer vertical stacked bar charts.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for the font style and size for text annotations.

  5. The legend can be placed at the bottom of the chart.

  6. I do not know if there are specific countries to focus on or highlight in the
  chart.

  7. The annotations for key years should be detailed enough to show significant changes
  but not overly complex.

  8. I have no specific preferences for the chart title or axis labels.
