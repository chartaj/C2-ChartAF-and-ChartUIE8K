initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map visualizing the age-standardized death
  rates from malaria per 100,000 people globally between 1990 and 2016. The map should
  show data for both sexes combined. Use color gradients to represent different rates,
  with darker colors indicating higher death rates. Include a legend to interpret
  the rates and enable users to interact with the map by hovering over countries to
  see detailed data for each year. The map should allow for year selection to observe
  changes over time. Make sure to handle missing values appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient scheme to be used
  for representing different death rates?

  2. Would you like specific endpoints or value ranges for the color gradient, or
  should it be auto-calculated based on the data?

  3. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  etc.)?

  4. Should the legend be discrete (categorical) or continuous?

  5. Do you want to include any particular labels or annotations on the map?

  6. How would you like to handle the missing values in visualization? Should they
  be marked in a specific way?

  7. Do you have any preference for the placement and design of the legend on the
  map?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific regions or countries on the map?

  9. Do you prefer a specific design for the year selection tool (e.g., slider, dropdown
  menu)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. The endpoints or value ranges can be auto-calculated based on the data.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the map projection type.

  4. Continuous, please.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Marking missing values in a specific way would be helpful.

  7. I am not sure about the placement and design of the legend.

  8. No need to highlight specific regions or countries.

  9. A slider for the year selection tool would be good.'
