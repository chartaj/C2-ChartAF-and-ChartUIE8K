initial_prompt: I have a dataset that contains information on malaria death rates
  (age-standardized per 100,000 people) from 1990 to 2016. The relevant columns are
  Entity (country name), Code (country code), Year, and Deaths - Malaria (rate per
  100,000 people). Could you create a line chart that plots the malaria death rates
  over the years for each country? Please make sure that the x-axis represents the
  years and the y-axis represents the death rates. It would be great if each country
  could be distinguishable with different colored lines. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  countries?

  2. Would you like to include data labels for specific data points on the chart?

  3. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight in the visualization?

  4. What title would you like for the chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you need a legend to identify the countries by color?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specified range or should it adjust automatically based
  on the data?

  9. Are there any specific milestones or events you want to annotate on the chart?

  10. Would you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for any of the
  countries?'
