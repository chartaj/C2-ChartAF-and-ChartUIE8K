initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the trade data of India
  from 1997 to July 2022. The x-axis should represent the Financial Year(start) and
  the y-axis should represent the values. Plot separate scatters for Export, Import,
  Total Trade, and Trade Balance. Please use different colors or markers for each
  type of trade value. This will help in understanding the variation of exports and
  imports over the specified time period clearly. Also, ensure to label the axes and
  provide a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different trade values
  in the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a grid for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer specific marker styles (e.g., circle, square, triangle) for each
  trade value?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and legend?

  5. Should the Financial Year(start) on the x-axis display every year or can it be
  grouped (e.g., every 5 years)?

  6. Do you need any annotations or additional information on the chart?

  7. Is there a specific chart title you would like to use?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, a grid would help with better readability.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Displaying every 5 years is fine.
