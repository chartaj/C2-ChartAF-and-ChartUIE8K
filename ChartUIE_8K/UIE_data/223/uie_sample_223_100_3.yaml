initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart that visualizes the exports and imports of
  India from 1997 to July 2022. The chart should have the financial years on the x-axis
  and the values of exports and imports on the y-axis. Please differentiate exports
  and imports using different colors or patterns, and clearly indicate any missing
  data points. Additionally, please include a legend and appropriate labels for clarity.
  Highlight the trade balance as well, either with another bar series or by using
  annotations. This will help in understanding the overall trade performance over
  the given period.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating exports and
  imports?

  2. Would you prefer the bars representing exports and imports to be side-by-side
  or stacked?

  3. Is there a specific style or pattern you would like to use for the bars representing
  missing data points?

  4. How would you like the trade balance to be highlightedâ€”using another bar series
  or annotations?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout and positioning of the legend?

  6. Should the y-axis use a linear or logarithmic scale for the values of exports
  and imports?

  7. Are there specific labels or annotations you would like to be included on the
  chart for clarity?'
