02_initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart that visualizes the exports and imports
  of India from 1997 to July 2022. The chart should have the financial years on the
  x-axis and the values of exports and imports on the y-axis. Please differentiate
  exports and imports using different colors or patterns, and clearly indicate any
  missing data points. Additionally, please include a legend and appropriate labels
  for clarity. Highlight the trade balance as well, either with another bar series
  or by using annotations. This will help in understanding the overall trade performance
  over the given period.
