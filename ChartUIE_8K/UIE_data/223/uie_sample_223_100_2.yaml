initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing India's exports and imports from 1997
  to July 2022. Use data-driven annotations to highlight key data points, such as
  years with highest and lowest trade values. Emphasize the trade balance by color-coding
  the histogram bars. Highlight years with significant trade imbalances using distinct
  colors. Add text annotations to provide context on notable years or trends, such
  as economic events impacting trade. The primary purpose is to provide a clear visual
  comparison of exports and imports over the years and to identify trends and significant
  changes in trade balance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  between exports and imports?

  2. Are there specific economic events or time periods you would like highlighted
  with annotations?

  3. Should the histogram bars be displayed with a particular bin size (e.g., yearly,
  monthly)?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color-coding and annotations?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for text annotations?

  6. Would you like to add gridlines or a background that emphasizes the comparison?

  7. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the histogram (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Are there any additional data points or external references you want included
  in the visualization?

  9. Do you have a preference for the layout and positioning of the title, axis labels,
  and annotations?

  10. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for the y-axis to better visualize
  trade values?'
