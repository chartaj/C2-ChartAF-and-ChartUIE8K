initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the export and import values
  of India over different financial years from 1997 to July 2022. The x-axis should
  represent the financial years, while the y-axis should display the trade values.
  Each box should represent the range of export and import values for that year. I
  am particularly interested in identifying trends, outliers, and variations in trade
  values over the years. Additionally, it would be helpful if you could highlight
  any significant changes or anomalies in the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between export
  and import values?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be specifically highlighted in a distinct color
  or symbol?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability of the y-axis values?

  4. Do you have a specific format or style preference for the financial year labels
  on the x-axis?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to include for significant
  changes or anomalies in the data?

  6. Should the y-axis be scaled to accommodate potential outliers, or do you prefer
  a more zoomed-in view for typical trade values?

  7. Do you want to include a legend that clearly defines the box plot elements (e.g.,
  median, quartiles, whiskers) for export and import values?

  8. Would you prefer any additional statistical summaries, such as mean or standard
  deviation, to be included on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to add to the chart for
  context or clarification (e.g., chart title, axis titles)?'
