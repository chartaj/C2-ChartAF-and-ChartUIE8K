02_initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart showcasing the comment activity over time
  for the song 'Shape of You'. Highlight key dates with spikes in comments. Annotate
  points with unusually high likes or reply counts. The chart should focus on drawing
  attention to the engagement trends to understand community interest and interaction
  over time. Use one line representing total comments and another for replies. Ensure
  the data points are clearly marked, showing trends from the provided sample data.
  Emphasize the relationship between comment volume, likes, and replies to help analyze
  engagement patterns.
