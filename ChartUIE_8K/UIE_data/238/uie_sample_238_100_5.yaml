initial_prompt: I need an area chart displaying the trend of engagement over time
  for 'Shape of You' comments. The chart should use data from the CSV file and include
  variables like published date, likes, and reply count. Ensure the x-axis represents
  'Published At' dates, and the y-axis shows engagement metrics (likes and reply counts).
  Highlight the aggregated likes and reply counts to visualize peaks and troughs in
  interactions over the given timeframe. This chart will help us understand patterns
  in user engagement and how it changes over time for the song's comment section.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the area chart?

  2. Would you prefer to display the likes and reply counts as separate areas within
  the same chart, or should they be stacked?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between likes and reply counts?

  4. Is there a specific date range you want to focus on in the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred format for the date display on the x-axis (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY,
  Month Year)?

  6. Do you want the peaks and troughs to be highlighted in a specific way (e.g.,
  different colors or markers)?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles on the
  chart?

  9. Would you like tooltips or data labels to display the exact values when hovering
  over the chart areas?

  10. Should the chart include a title and, if so, do you have a preferred title for
  it?'
