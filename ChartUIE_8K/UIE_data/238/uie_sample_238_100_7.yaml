initial_prompt: I'd like a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between 'Published
  At' and 'Likes' for comments on the song "Shape of You." The x-axis should represent
  the 'Published At' timestamps, and the y-axis should represent the number of 'Likes'
  each comment received. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between comments
  with and without replies. Ensure that the scatter plot captures the range of dates
  effectively and that the points are clearly visible even if many overlap. Include
  labels and a legend to make the chart easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing comments with
  and without replies?

  2. Would you like specific shapes or markers for different categories (with replies
  vs. without replies)?

  3. Is there a specific date range you want to focus on for the ''Published At''
  timestamps?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the scatter plot?

  5. Should the labels for the axes include specific formatting or additional information?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use different shapes for different categories (e.g., circles for
  comments with replies and triangles for comments without replies).

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  7. I do not know.'
