initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart that visualizes the sentiment and engagement
  of comments on the 'Shape of You' song over time. The X-axis should represent the
  "Published At" dates, and the Y-axis should show the number of "Likes" each comment
  received. The size of the bubbles should reflect the "Reply Count" to each comment.
  Additionally, color-code the bubbles based on the uniqueness of the comments (perhaps
  using the unique values in the "Comment" column). This visualization should help
  analyze how different comments are received and their level of engagement over time.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the chart?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used for the bubble colors?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Would you like to include tooltips to display details of each comment when hovering
  over the bubbles?

  6. Should there be a legend explaining the color-coding of the bubbles?

  7. Do you prefer a particular order for the dates on the x-axis (e.g., ascending
  or descending)?

  8. Is there a specific range for the y-axis (number of likes) you want to set?

  9. Do you want to include data labels directly on the bubbles?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the title, maybe something simple like "Shape of
  You - Comment Sentiment and Engagement Over Time".

  2. I do not have any specific preference for the color palette.

  3. X-axis label: "Published At", Y-axis label: "Likes".

  4. Yes, gridlines would be helpful for readability.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, a legend explaining the color-coding of the bubbles would be good.

  7. I have no specific preference for the order of dates.

  8. I do not know if there should be a specific range for the y-axis.

  9. I am not sure about including data labels directly on the bubbles.

  10. I have no specific preference for fonts or styles.'
