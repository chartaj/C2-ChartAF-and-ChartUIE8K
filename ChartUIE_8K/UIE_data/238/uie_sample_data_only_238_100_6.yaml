02_initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart that visualizes the sentiment and engagement
  of comments on the 'Shape of You' song over time. The X-axis should represent the
  "Published At" dates, and the Y-axis should show the number of "Likes" each comment
  received. The size of the bubbles should reflect the "Reply Count" to each comment.
  Additionally, color-code the bubbles based on the uniqueness of the comments (perhaps
  using the unique values in the "Comment" column). This visualization should help
  analyze how different comments are received and their level of engagement over time.
