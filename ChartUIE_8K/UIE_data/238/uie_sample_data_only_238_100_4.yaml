02_initial_prompt: I need a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of unique values
  in the 'Reply Count' column from the user comments about the 'Shape of You' song.
  This chart should show the relative proportions of comments with different reply
  counts, providing a clear view of interaction levels within the community. Use varied
  colors to differentiate each segment, and include labels for each reply count category.
  Ensure the pie chart is easy to read, with a legend that helps identify each segment
  accurately. This will help understand how actively users are engaging with each
  other through replies.
