- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually.\n<end of the annotation\

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need an area chart displaying the trend of engagement over time for 'Shape of
  You' comments. The chart should use data from the CSV file and include variables
  like published date, likes, and reply count. Ensure the x-axis represents 'Published
  At' dates, and the y-axis shows engagement metrics (likes and reply counts). Highlight
  the aggregated likes and reply counts to visualize peaks and troughs in interactions
  over the given timeframe. This chart will help us understand patterns in user engagement
  and how it changes over time for the song's comment section.
