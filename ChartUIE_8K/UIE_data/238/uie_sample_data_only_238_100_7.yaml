02_initial_prompt: I'd like a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between 'Published
  At' and 'Likes' for comments on the song "Shape of You." The x-axis should represent
  the 'Published At' timestamps, and the y-axis should represent the number of 'Likes'
  each comment received. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between comments
  with and without replies. Ensure that the scatter plot captures the range of dates
  effectively and that the points are clearly visible even if many overlap. Include
  labels and a legend to make the chart easy to interpret. Thank you!
