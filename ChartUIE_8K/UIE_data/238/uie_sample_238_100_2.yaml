initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the buzz around the song 'Shape of You'
  in online communities. Use data on comments, anonymized authors, published timestamps,
  likes, and reply counts. Annotations should highlight comments with the highest
  likes and reply counts to draw attention to significant interactions. This visualization
  will help understand engagement patterns and the song's impact over time. Additionally,
  use color gradients to indicate varying levels of interaction metrics. This will
  provide a clear visual representation of active periods and popular comments, making
  it easier to identify trends and key moments in the discussion.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for indicating varying
  levels of interaction metrics?

  2. Would you prefer the heatmap to be segmented by specific time intervals (e.g.,
  hours, days, weeks)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the type or style of annotations used to highlight
  comments with the highest likes and reply counts?

  4. Is there a specific layout or format you prefer for displaying the timestamps?

  5. Are there any particular fonts, sizes, or styles you prefer for the text in the
  visualization?'
