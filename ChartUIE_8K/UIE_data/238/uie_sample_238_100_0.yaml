initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart showcasing the comment activity over time for
  the song 'Shape of You'. Highlight key dates with spikes in comments. Annotate points
  with unusually high likes or reply counts. The chart should focus on drawing attention
  to the engagement trends to understand community interest and interaction over time.

  points are clearly marked, showing trends from the provided sample data. Emphasize
  the relationship between comment volume, likes, and replies to help analyze engagement
  patterns.

  comments and replies?

  markers, different colors)

  4. Would you like the annotations for high likes or reply counts to include specific
  text or labels?

  5. Should the y-axis be kept at a fixed scale or allow for automatic scaling based
  on data range?

  (e.g., daily, monthly)?

  7. Do you want grid lines to be displayed in the background for better readability?

  8. Is there a specific font type or size you would prefer for the labels and annotations
  on the chart?

  9. Would you like a legend to distinguish between total comments and replies? If
