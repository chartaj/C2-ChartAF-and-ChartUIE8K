initial_prompt: Create an area chart using the 'time' column for the x-axis and 'signal'
  column for the y-axis. Highlight specific data points with text annotations to draw
  attention to significant peaks in the signal. Use color variations to emphasize
  changes in signal strength over time. This will help in easily identifying trends
  and anomalies within the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart?

  2. Would you like to specify the threshold for significant peaks to be highlighted?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for the significant peaks to be formatted
  (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the overall style of the chart (e.g., gridlines,
  background color)?

  6. Is there a specific range of time you would like the chart to focus on?

  7. Do you want the area under the curve to be filled with a gradient color based
  on signal strength, or a solid color?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Font size should be readable, maybe a bit larger than usual, and the color should
  be noticeable against the chart background.

  4. X-axis labeled as ''Time'' and y-axis labeled as ''Signal''.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Gradient color based on signal strength sounds good.'
