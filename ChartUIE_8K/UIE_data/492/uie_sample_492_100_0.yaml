initial_prompt: Visualize a histogram using the 'time' and 'signal' data, categorizing
  signal frequency variations over time. Add text annotations to highlight key data
  points, like signal peaks and troughs, enhancing focus on these values. Use highlights
  to differentiate significant fluctuations from the rest, ensuring they stand out.
  This visualization will help analyze signal patterns and trends, providing insights
  into data distribution and assisting in anomaly detection. The histogram will serve
  both as an analytical tool and a visual summary, aiding in interpreting the dataset
  more effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the highlights used to differentiate
  significant fluctuations?

  2. Would you like specific colors for the signal peaks and troughs annotations?

  3. Should the bins in the histogram be of a specific width?

  4. Do you prefer any particular text font or size for the annotations?

  5. Is there a specific range or limit on the time axis that you would like to focus
  on?

  6. Are there any other key data points, apart from peaks and troughs, that you would
  like to be annotated?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or style of the histogram?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  9. Should there be a legend to explain the meaning of highlights and annotations?

  10. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to have for the axes
  and the chart as a whole?'
