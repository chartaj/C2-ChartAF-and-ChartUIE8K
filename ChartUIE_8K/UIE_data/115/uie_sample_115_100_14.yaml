initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize the nutritional values of different
  Indonesian foods and drinks. Specifically, I want to compare the calories, proteins,
  fat, and carbohydrate content across various items in your dataset. Each food item
  should be represented by a dot, with different colors indicating the type of nutritional
  value. Use the 'name' field for labeling the dots. Ensure the plot is clear and
  easily distinguishable. Additionally, include image URLs as tooltips when hovering
  over the dots for more context. This will help in understanding the nutritional
  distribution of Indonesian foods and drinks comprehensively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different nutritional
  values (calories, proteins, fat, carbohydrate)?

  2. What label positioning do you prefer for the dots representing each food item?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to explain the colors representing different
  nutritional values?

  4. What font size and style would you like for the labels on the dots?

  5. How would you like the axes to be scaled and labeled?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the tooltip design when hovering over
  the dots?

  7. Would you like to add any additional information or annotations on the plot?'
