initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset. I want to compare the distribution of calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates
  across the different food items in the dataset. Specifically, the x-axis should
  represent the different nutritional categories (calories, proteins, fat, carbohydrates),
  and the y-axis should show the values for these categories. This visualization should
  help in understanding the spread and density of these nutritional values for various
  food items. Make sure to include labels and a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different nutritional
  categories (calories, proteins, fat, carbohydrates)?

  2. Would you prefer the violin plots to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and legend?

  4. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer any particular kernel density estimation method for the violin
  plot?

  6. Would you like to include the median or mean markers on the violin plots?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the plot background color or overall
  theme?

  8. Should the plot include individual data points (e.g., using jitter) within the
  violin shapes?

  9. Are custom tick marks or a specific range on the y-axis necessary for clarity?

  10. Would you like to add any additional annotations or text on the plot for highlighting
  specific aspects?'
