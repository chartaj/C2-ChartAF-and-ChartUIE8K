initial_prompt: I need a column chart visualizing the nutritional content (calories,
  proteins, fat, and carbohydrate) of various Indonesian foods and drinks. The x-axis
  should have the names of the items, and there should be separate columns for each
  nutritional element on the y-axis. Please ensure that each food item is clearly
  labeled with its name and image provided as tooltips. This will help me compare
  the nutritional values of the foods easily. The dataset includes multiple types
  of foods and drinks, so please make sure all items are included in the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the columns representing different
  nutritional elements?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the labels on the x-axis?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate the nutritional elements?
  If yes, where should it be placed?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines on the y-axis for better readability? If so,
  do you prefer horizontal, vertical, or both types of gridlines?

  5. How would you like the tooltip displaying the images to be formatted? Do you
  have any specific size or style preferences for the images in the tooltips?

  6. Do you have a preference for sorting the items on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by calorie content)?

  7. Should the y-axis have a fixed range, or should it be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?

  8. Do you want to display data values on top of each column? If yes, do you prefer
  any specific style or formatting for these values?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of
  the chart?

  10. Are there any specific Indonesian foods or drinks that you would like to emphasize
  or highlight in the chart?'
