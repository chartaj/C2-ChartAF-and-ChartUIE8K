initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart visualizing the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset. Specifically, the chart should compare the average values of calories,
  proteins, fat, and carbohydrates for the different food items. Each bar should represent
  a different nutrient, allowing me to see which nutrients are most prevalent on average
  across the dataset. Additionally, please ensure that the food names are displayed
  along the x-axis and the nutrient values on the y-axis. This will help me easily
  identify nutritional content variations among different food items. Thank you!

  nutrients?

  2. Would you like to display the exact average values on top of each bar?

  4. Do you have any preference for the chart''s title and axis labels?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the text in the chart?'
