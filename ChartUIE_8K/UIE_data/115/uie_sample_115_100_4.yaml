initial_prompt: I want a grouped bar chart to compare the nutritional content of different
  Indonesian foods. The chart should display calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates
  side by side for each food item. Use the sample data to visualize foods like Abon,
  Abon haruwan, and Agar-agar. Make sure each food has a separate group and within
  each group, show bars for calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. Also, include
  the names of the foods on the x-axis and the nutrient values on the y-axis. Please
  ensure the colors of the bars for different nutrients are distinct.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for each nutrient?

  2. Do you want the bars to display the exact numerical values of the nutrients on
  the chart?

  3. Would you like any specific font or style for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Is there a particular order in which you would like the foods to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  5. Do you prefer a legend to be included for the nutrient colors, and if so, where
  should it be placed on the chart?

  6. What size would you prefer for the chart (e.g., dimensions in pixels or inches)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the thickness or spacing of the bars within each
  group?

  8. Should there be any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Will you require axis labels and gridlines, and if so, any preferences for their
  style and format?

  10. Is there a need for any annotations or additional information to be included
  on the chart?'
