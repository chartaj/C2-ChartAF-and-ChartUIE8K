initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition dataset
  using a bubble chart. The chart should display food items with calories on the x-axis,
  proteins on the y-axis, and bubble sizes representing the fat content. Each bubble
  should be labeled with the food name. The chart should help in comparing the nutritional
  values of different food items at a glance. Please use distinct colors for different
  food categories to enhance readability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used for different
  food categories?

  2. How should the food categories be differentiated visually? For example, by specific
  colors or shades?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for labeling the food names
  on the bubbles?

  4. How dense or sparse should the bubbles be to avoid overlap while maintaining
  readability?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better alignment or should they be omitted
  for a cleaner look?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors used for different food
  categories?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the axes, such as scale type (linear
  or logarithmic), label formatting, or title?

  8. Would you prefer to have tooltips or data labels directly on the chart for additional
  information when hovering over a bubble?

  9. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the bubble
  chart?'
