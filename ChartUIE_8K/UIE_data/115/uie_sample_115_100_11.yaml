initial_prompt: Create a donut chart using the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset to visualize the distribution of calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates
  for different food items. The chart should display each nutrient as a separate section
  of the donut, highlighting their proportionate values. Use contrasting colors for
  each nutrient and label each segment with the respective nutrient name and percentage
  value. Include only the first 10 food items from the dataset to keep the chart clear
  and readable. The chart should provide a visual summary of the nutritional content
  for easy comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a legend for colors, or should the segments
  be labeled directly?

  3. How would you prefer the percentage values to be displayed - inside the segments
  or outside?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the labels?

  5. Do you want the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  6. Should the chart include any additional annotations or notes for clarity?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or positioning of the chart elements
  (e.g., labels, legend)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information such as serving size or
  food category in the chart?'
