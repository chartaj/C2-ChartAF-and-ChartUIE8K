initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset. I want the x-axis to represent the different food items by their names,
  and the y-axis to show their respective nutritional values. Include separate lines
  for calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates. This will help me compare the nutritional
  content of each food item visually. Make sure to have a legend to distinguish between
  the different nutritional components. Include only a portion of the dataset for
  clarity, say the first 10 items. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the lines representing calories,
  proteins, fat, and carbohydrates?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer the data points on the lines to be marked with symbols (e.g., circles,
  squares) for each food item?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include data labels showing the nutritional values at each
  data point?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the title and axis labels of the chart?

  7. Would you like the chart to be in a specific aspect ratio (e.g., square, wide,
  tall)?'
