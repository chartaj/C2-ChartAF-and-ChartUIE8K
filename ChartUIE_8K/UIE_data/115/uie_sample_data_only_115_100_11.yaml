02_initial_prompt: Create a donut chart using the Indonesian Food and Drink Nutrition
  Dataset to visualize the distribution of calories, proteins, fat, and carbohydrates
  for different food items. The chart should display each nutrient as a separate section
  of the donut, highlighting their proportionate values. Use contrasting colors for
  each nutrient and label each segment with the respective nutrient name and percentage
  value. Include only the first 10 food items from the dataset to keep the chart clear
  and readable. The chart should provide a visual summary of the nutritional content
  for easy comparison.
