initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the data focusing on the
  'Urban' and 'Rural' values over the 'Year'. Annotate key data points to highlight
  significant changes or trends. Use highlights to emphasize years with the highest
  and lowest values for both 'Urban' and 'Rural' categories. The purpose of this visualization
  is to clearly show how urban and rural figures have evolved over the given years,
  making it easy to compare and analyze shifts. This chart should effectively help
  in understanding trends in agriculture and farming over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the highest and
  lowest values for both ''Urban'' and ''Rural'' categories?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or labels on the chart for significant changes
  or trends? If so, please specify.

  3. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the chart text and labels?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, what style or intensity do you
  prefer for them?

  6. Do you prefer seeing the exact data values on the bars themselves, or should
  they be included in a tooltip?

  7. Would you like the years with the highest and lowest values to be highlighted
  in a specific way (e.g., with different shapes, colors, or borders)?

  8. Are there any additional visual elements or decorations you would like to include
  in the chart (e.g., legend, title, subtitle)?'
