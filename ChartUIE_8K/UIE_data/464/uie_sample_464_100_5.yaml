initial_prompt: 'I need an area chart that shows the trends in urban and rural populations
  from 2000 to 2016. The data provided includes yearly values for urban and rural
  populations. For each year, plot two separate areas in the chart: one for urban
  and one for rural. The x-axis should represent the years, and the y-axis should
  represent the population values. Make sure the chart clearly differentiates between
  urban and rural areas with distinct colors. The chart should also show the combined
  growth over the years to reflect changes in population trends accurately.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for distinguishing between the
  urban and rural areas in the chart?

  2. Would you like the combined growth to be shown as an additional line or area
  on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the axis labels and chart title?

  4. Do you want any particular grid lines (horizontal, vertical, or both) to be included
  in the background for better readability?

  5. Should the chart include data point markers for each year, or should it be a
  continuous area fill without markers?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Horizontal grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  5. I prefer a continuous area fill without markers.'
