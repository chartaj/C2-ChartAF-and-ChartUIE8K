initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart visualizing the given data, which represents
  the distribution of the population between urban and rural areas over the years.
  I want to see how these trends have changed from 2000 to 2016. Plot the years on
  the x-axis and the population percentages on the y-axis. Use different colors for
  urban and rural areas to distinguish them easily. This visualization is for understanding
  how population dynamics have evolved in agricultural and farming regions over time.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easily interpretable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for representing urban and
  rural areas?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style of the lines, such as dashed or solid?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Should the chart include data labels for specific points or just the axes labels?

  5. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like to have a legend on the chart, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you want to include any annotations or markers for significant years or events
  on the chart?
