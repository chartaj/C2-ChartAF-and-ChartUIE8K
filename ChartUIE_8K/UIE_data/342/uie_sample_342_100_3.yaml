  Please visualize the distribution of "Open," "High," "Low," "Close," and "Volume"
  values over the dates provided in the dataset. It's important that each of these
  financial metrics is represented in the violin plot to show their respective data
  distributions. This will help analyze the spread and density of these values and
  gain insights into their variability. Ensure the plot highlights how these financial

  decisions in cryptocurrency trading.

  patterns in the data?
