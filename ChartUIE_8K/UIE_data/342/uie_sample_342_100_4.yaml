initial_prompt: I have cryptocurrency data including Date, Open, High, Low, Close,
  Adj Close, and Volume for Cardano. I want to visualize this data with a dynamic
  candlestick chart to track the price movements over time. The chart should display
  the daily performance, highlighting the Open, High, Low, and Close prices. Additionally,
  I need a volume overlay to correlate trading volume with price changes. Ensure the
  chart is interactive, allowing me to zoom in on specific date ranges and hover over
  data points to view details. The visualization needs to be clear and insightful
  for market analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the candlestick chart?

  2. Would you like the volume overlay to be represented as bars, lines, or another
  format?

  3. Should the chart include any specific markers or annotations for significant
  events or dates?

  4. Do you prefer the axes to be labeled in a specific way (e.g., specific date format,
  logarithmic scale for volume)?

  5. Is there a preferred time interval for the chart''s default view (e.g., one month,
  six months, one year)?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, in which style?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s title and subtitles?

  8. Should the candlestick bodies be filled in a particular style (e.g., hollow for
  rising prices, solid for falling prices)?

  9. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like to be included in the chart
  for clarity?

  10. Do you prefer the chart background to be a particular color or texture?'
