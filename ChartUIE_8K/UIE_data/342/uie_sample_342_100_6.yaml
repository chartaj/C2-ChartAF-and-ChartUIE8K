initial_prompt: I want to visualize Cardano cryptocurrency trends over time using
  a stacked area chart. The chart should display how values of 'Open', 'High', 'Low',
  'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume' evolve from date to date. This will help identify
  potential correlations and trends. Make sure each category is represented distinctly
  and the areas are stacked to show cumulative values over time. Utilize the data
  from the file for accurate plotting and ensure the x-axis represents dates while
  y-axis shows the values. It should be easy to compare these metrics over the given
  dates.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different categories?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for easier comparison of values?

  3. How should the y-axis be scaled? (Linear, logarithmic, etc.)

  4. Do you prefer to display data points along the area chart lines for precise value
  identification?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on the chart?

  6. Would you like to highlight any particular date ranges or events in the chart?

  7. Should the legend be placed inside or outside of the chart area?

  8. Do you want to include a title and subtitles for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  9. Do you want each category to have a distinct opacity level for easier differentiation?

  10. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the axes labels and legend?'
