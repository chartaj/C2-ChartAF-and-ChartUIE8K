initial_prompt: 'Hi there,


  I''d like to visualize the trading volume of Cardano over time. Could you create
  a histogram using the ''Volume'' data from the CSV file I provided? Please plot
  the trading volume along the Y-axis and the corresponding dates along the X-axis.
  I''m particularly interested in seeing the distribution and frequency of high trading
  volume days, so make sure the bins are appropriately spaced to highlight any peaks
  in trading activity. This will help me understand the trading patterns and identify
  any significant spikes in volume. Thanks!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the bins (e.g., equal-width, variable-width)?

  4. Should the x-axis labels be rotated for better readability?

  5. Do you want the chart to include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have
  any preferences for the text?

  6. Would you like to see any additional annotations or markers for high volume days?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific date ranges you would like to highlight or focus on?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please rotate the x-axis labels for better readability.

  5. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. I prefer "Cardano Trading Volume
  Over Time" as the title, and "Date" for the x-axis and "Volume" for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not know.'
