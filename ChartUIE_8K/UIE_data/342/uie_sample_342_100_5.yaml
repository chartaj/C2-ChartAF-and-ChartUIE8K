initial_prompt: Could you create a box chart for me that visualizes the historical
  price movements of Cardano, particularly using the Open, High, Low, and Close prices
  from the dataset provided? I'd like the x-axis to represent the date and the y-axis
  to show the price in USD. The box chart should help in understanding the price volatility
  and the range of prices for Cardano. Please ensure that the box plots for each of
  these prices (Open, High, Low, Close) are clearly distinguishable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the box plots
  for ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', and ''Close'' prices?

  2. Would you like to include grids for better readability of the price movements
  on the y-axis?

  3. How should the dates be presented on the x-axis? (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)

  4. Do you prefer any specific range or limit on the y-axis for the price in USD?

  5. Would you like to include annotations or labels on specific data points or outliers?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to clearly identify each type of price (Open,
  High, Low, Close)?

  7. Are there any specific time periods or date ranges you would like to emphasize
  or highlight in the chart?'

  2. Yes, including grids would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.
