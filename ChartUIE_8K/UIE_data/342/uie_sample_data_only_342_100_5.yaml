  price movements of Cardano, particularly using the Open, High, Low, and Close prices
  from the dataset provided? I'd like the x-axis to represent the date and the y-axis
  to show the price in USD. The box chart should help in understanding the price volatility
  and the range of prices for Cardano. Please ensure that the box plots for each of
  these prices (Open, High, Low, Close) are clearly distinguishable. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
