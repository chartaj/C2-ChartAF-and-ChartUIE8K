initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the historical price movements
  of Cardano. The chart should use the data from the given CSV file and include lines
  for 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Volume' over the date range. Make sure
  to color-code each line for clarity. Additionally, it would be helpful to include
  a legend and appropriate labels on the axes to clearly indicate the data being presented.
  This visualization will help in analyzing the performance trends and volatility
  of Cardano over time. Thank you!

  ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', ''Close'', and ''Volume''?

  2. What style would you like the lines to be (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  3. Are there any particular fonts you would prefer for the chart labels and legend?

  4. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability? If so,
  should they be in the background or foreground?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis scales or ranges?

  7. Would you prefer the volume to be displayed on a secondary y-axis for better
  clarity?

  8. Do you need any additional annotations or markers on the chart for significant
  events or data points?'
