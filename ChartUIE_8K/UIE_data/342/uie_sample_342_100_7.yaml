initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap that visualizes a correlation matrix for
  the Cardano cryptocurrency dataset. The heatmap should show the relationships between
  the different numerical columns: Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.
  Highlight areas of strong positive or negative correlation in contrasting colors
  to make it easier to identify these relationships at a glance. This visualization
  will help in analyzing how different variables of Cardano''s trading data are interrelated.
  Ensure that the color gradient is visually appealing and the axis labels are clearly
  readable.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient to be used
  in the heatmap?

  2. Are there any specific color schemes you would like to use for highlighting strong
  positive and negative correlations?

  3. What is your preferred range of correlation values for highlighting (e.g., >0.7
  and <-0.7)?

  4. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., font size, font type)?

  5. Do you require any additional labels or annotations on the heatmap?'
