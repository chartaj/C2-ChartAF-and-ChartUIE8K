2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart showing the number of unique news titles and descriptions over
  time, with different lines for each news channel. Highlight points where significant
  news events occurred, like a missing child, a robbery, or a fatal accident. Annotate
  these points to provide more context. This visualization will help understand trends
  in news reporting frequency by different channels and draw attention to key events.
