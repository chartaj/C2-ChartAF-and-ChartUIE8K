initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that shows the count of unique news titles
  and the number of news articles from each news channel. The x-axis should represent
  the news channel names, and the y-axis should represent the count of news articles.
  Each bar should show both the total number of unique news titles for that news channel
  and the total number of articles reported. This chart will help visualize the distribution
  of news articles across different news channels, based on the data provided in the
  Community Events Report Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels indicating the exact count of
  news articles and unique titles on each bar?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be grouped side-by-side for easier comparison or stacked
  for a more compact view?

  4. Should the y-axis be on a linear scale or a logarithmic scale?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the values?

  6. Do you want a legend to differentiate between unique news titles and the total
  number of articles?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?'
