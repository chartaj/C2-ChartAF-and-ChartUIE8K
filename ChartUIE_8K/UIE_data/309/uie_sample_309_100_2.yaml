initial_prompt: Create a pie chart titled "News Coverage Distribution" using the "News
  Channel Name" column from the dataset. This chart should illustrate the proportion
  of news stories covered by each news channel. Annotate the chart with percentages
  for each segment to highlight the distribution of news coverage among different
  news channels. This will help in understanding which channels are more active in
  reporting. Additionally, use highlights such as different colors for each channel
  to make the chart visually appealing and the distinctions clear. This visualization
  serves to quickly inform viewers about the spread of media coverage across various
  channels.
