initial_prompt: I would like to create a bar chart visualizing Reliance's stock data
  from 18 May'12 to 13 Oct'21. Each bar will represent the opening stock prices with
  separate annotations marking the opening, highest, lowest, and closing values. Highlights
  should indicate significant spikes or drops. This chart will help in understanding
  the stock performance trends over the specified period. Use text annotations to
  label significant dates. The purpose is to show trends and anomalies in stock prices
  over time, focusing on key points, making it easier to analyze the performance visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like to have grid lines to help with reading the values?

  3. Should the y-axis be automatically scaled or do you have specific limits in mind?

  4. What style of text annotations do you prefer for labeling significant dates and
  values?

  5. Are there specific dates or events you already know that you want to highlight?

  6. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical bars for the bar chart?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations?

  8. How would you like the significant spikes or drops to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, bold outlines)?

  9. Would you like to show data labels along with the bars or only on highlights
  and significant dates?

  10. Should the chart include a legend to describe the annotations for the highest,
  lowest, opening, and closing values?'
