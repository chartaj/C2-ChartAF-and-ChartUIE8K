initial_prompt: Please provide a pie chart visualization using the stock data from
  105.csv. I want to see the proportions of total volume traded across the given dates.
  Each segment on the pie chart should represent a day's trading volume. Ensure the
  chart is clear and labeled. Include a legend for the Date and any significant values
  to better understand the distribution. The business details are not required on
  the chart, just a simple yet informative pie chart focusing on Volume over the sample
  period. Thank you!
