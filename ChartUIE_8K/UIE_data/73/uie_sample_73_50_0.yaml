initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the average volume of bytes across
  different external IPs. Include annotations to highlight the highest and lowest
  average volumes. This helps illustrate potential anomalies or significant variances
  in network traffic, which could be crucial for cybersecurity analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to have grid lines for easier readability?

  3. Do you want the external IPs to be sorted in a specific order (e.g., ascending
  or descending based on volume)?

  4. Is there a specific font type and size you prefer for the annotations?

  5. Would you like to include labels on the bars to show the exact average volume
  of bytes?

  6. Should the y-axis be labeled with a specific scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (if applicable)?

  8. Are there any specific chart titles or axis labels you would like to include?

  9. Do you prefer any particular style for the annotations (e.g., arrows, highlighting,
  different color)?'
