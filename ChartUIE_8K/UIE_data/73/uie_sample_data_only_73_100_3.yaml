  1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the bin width or range; please use your best judgment.

  3. Yes, please include axis titles. "Number of TCP Packets" for the x-axis and "Count
  of Records" for the y-axis.

  4. I do not know; any position for the legend is fine.

  5. No specific title in mind.
