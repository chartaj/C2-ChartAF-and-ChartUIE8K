initial_prompt: Create a network diagram showcasing the relationships between external_ips
  and name. Highlight nodes with a higher number of tcp_packets to visually differentiate
  more active connections. Annotate nodes representing "AntiVirus" by noting their
  respective dist_port_tcp values to draw attention to specific port distributions.
  Additionally, emphasize any anomalies in the udp_packets values by changing the
  node color to prompt further investigation. Given the context of Network Traffic
  Android Malware in cybersecurity, the diagram will help in identifying potential
  malicious patterns and anomalies in network behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout style for the network diagram (e.g.,
  circular, hierarchical, force-directed)?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating node types and highlighting
  anomalies?

  3. Are there specific labels or legends you would like to include for better interpretation
  of the diagram?

  4. How would you prefer node size to be represented, given that it will reflect
  the number of ''tcp_packets''?

  5. Is there a specific threshold for what should be considered a "higher" number
  of ''tcp_packets''?

  6. What color would you like to use to highlight nodes with anomalies in ''udp_packets''?

  7. Would you like tooltips or annotations to include additional data attributes
  when hovering over nodes?

  8. Is there a particular format or content you''d like for the annotations on ''AntiVirus''
  nodes regarding their ''dist_port_tcp'' values?

  9. Are there specific visual markers or highlights you would like for connections
  originating from or terminating at ''external_ips''?

  10. Should the diagram include any filtering options to focus on specific ranges
  or categories of data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I think labels for each node reflecting their ''name'' and legends to differentiate
  node types would be helpful.

  4. Node size should be proportional to the number of ''tcp_packets''.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Perhaps a bright color like red to highlight nodes with anomalies in ''udp_packets''.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I would like the annotations to clearly indicate the ''dist_port_tcp'' values.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
