  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

09_answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like the text annotations to highlight any sudden spikes or drops and
  potentially significant events in the network traffic.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a background grid would be helpful.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between the types of network traffic.

  9. The x-axis can be labeled "Time," the y-axis labeled "Number of TCP Packets,"
  and the chart title can be "TCP Packets Over Time for Different Types of Network
  Traffic."
