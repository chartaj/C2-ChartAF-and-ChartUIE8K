initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize network traffic data from Android
  malware incidents. The x-axis should represent the timestamp of the incidents (if
  available), and the y-axis should show the volume of bytes transferred. Highlight
  different types of traffic patterns, such as 'benign' and potential 'malicious'
  activities, using different colors. Annotate key points where there are spikes in
  traffic volume, indicating potential anomalies or points of interest. This visualization
  helps in identifying unusual network behaviors and understanding traffic characteristics
  in cybersecurity context. Ensure all data columns like 'tcp_packets', 'source_app_bytes',
  etc., are clearly represented.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different types\
  \ of traffic patterns (e.g., 'benign' vs. 'malicious')?\n2. Are there specific timestamps\
  \ or time intervals that should be emphasized in the chart?\n3. Do you prefer specific\
  \ annotation styles for indicating spikes in traffic volume (e.g., arrows, labels,\
  \ markers)?\n4. How detailed should the annotations on key points with traffic volume\
  \ spikes be? \n5. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels?\n\
  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, how detailed should it be?\n7.\
  \ Are there any additional data columns you'd like to include in the chart for more\
  \ context?\n8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout and style of the\
  \ line (e.g., solid, dashed)?\n"
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; you can choose what looks best
  for distinguishing ''benign'' and ''malicious'' traffic.

  2. I do not have specific timestamps or time intervals in mind.

  3. I prefer arrows for indicating spikes in traffic volume.

  4. The annotations should be reasonably detailed to indicate the significance of
  the traffic spikes.

  5. I have no specific preference for the chart title and axis labels.

  6. Yes, the chart should include a legend, but I am not sure how detailed it should
  be.

  7. I do not know if additional data columns are necessary.

  8. I prefer a solid line for the overall layout and style of the line.'
