09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I think labels for each node reflecting their ''name'' and legends to differentiate
  node types would be helpful.

  4. Node size should be proportional to the number of ''tcp_packets''.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Perhaps a bright color like red to highlight nodes with anomalies in ''udp_packets''.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I would like the annotations to clearly indicate the ''dist_port_tcp'' values.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
