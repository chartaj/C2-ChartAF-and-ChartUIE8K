09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; you can choose what looks best
  for distinguishing ''benign'' and ''malicious'' traffic.

  2. I do not have specific timestamps or time intervals in mind.

  3. I prefer arrows for indicating spikes in traffic volume.

  4. The annotations should be reasonably detailed to indicate the significance of
  the traffic spikes.

  5. I have no specific preference for the chart title and axis labels.

  6. Yes, the chart should include a legend, but I am not sure how detailed it should
  be.

  7. I do not know if additional data columns are necessary.

  8. I prefer a solid line for the overall layout and style of the line.'
