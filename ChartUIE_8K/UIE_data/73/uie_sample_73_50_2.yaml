initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing "tcp_packets" over time for different
  "types" of network traffic (e.g., benign). Use text annotations to highlight key
  points in network traffic.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different types of network
  traffic?

  2. How would you like the time axis to be formatted (e.g., specific date/time format)?

  3. Would you like the text annotations to include specific details, and if so, what
  kind of information should they contain?

  4. Do you have any specific points in time or events that you want to ensure are
  highlighted with annotations?

  5. Would you prefer the line chart to have markers on data points, or should it
  be just lines?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size that you prefer for the text annotations?

  7. Do you want the chart to have a background grid for easier reading of values?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the types of network
  traffic?

  9. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the axes and the chart overall?

  10. Would you like to include any additional contextual information in the chart,
  such as average TCP packets over a specific period?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like the text annotations to highlight any sudden spikes or drops and
  potentially significant events in the network traffic.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a background grid would be helpful.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between the types of network traffic.

  9. The x-axis can be labeled "Time," the y-axis labeled "Number of TCP Packets,"
  and the chart title can be "TCP Packets Over Time for Different Types of Network
  Traffic."

  10. I am not sure.'
