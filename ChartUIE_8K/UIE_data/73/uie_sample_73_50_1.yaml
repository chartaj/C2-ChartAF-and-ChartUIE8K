initial_prompt: Create a network diagram visualizing Android malware traffic, highlighting
  connections between external IPs and applications. Annotate nodes with TCP/UDP packets.
  Make malicious traffic stand out by modifying their color. Ensure unique IPs and
  apps are clearly visible.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting malicious
  traffic?

  2. What colors would you like to use for benign traffic?

  3. Do you prefer certain shapes for nodes representing different types of applications
  or traffic?

  4. How would you like to annotate the nodes with TCP/UDP packets? (e.g., labels,
  tooltips, etc.)

  5. Do you have any preferred layout for the network diagram? (e.g., circular, hierarchical,
  force-directed)

  6. Would you like the network diagram to display edge weights or connection strengths?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for node labels and annotations?

  8. Should the size of the nodes represent the volume of traffic (e.g., number of
  packets)?

  9. Are there any additional legends or notes you would want to include in the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific styling preferences for the connections/edges between
  nodes?'
