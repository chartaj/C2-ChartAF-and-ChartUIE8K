initial_prompt: I want to create a stacked column chart to visualize this dataset.
  The x-axis should represent the different applications (values from the "name" column),
  and the y-axis should show the total count of packets (sum of "tcp_packets" and
  "udp_packets"). Stack the bars to differentiate the count of TCP packets versus
  UDP packets for each application. This will help in understanding the distribution
  of packet types across various applications. Label each section of the stack appropriately
  and ensure the chart is clear and easily interpretable.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the TCP and UDP
  packet sections in the stacked column chart?

  2. Would you like specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis, besides the
  default ''Application'' and ''Total Packet Count''?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and titles in the
  chart?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have specific preferences
  for its placement (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. How would you like the data values to be displayed on the chart (e.g., data labels
  on each section, tooltips, etc.)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific styles or formats for the grid lines and axes (e.g.,
  solid, dashed)?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart, and if so, what would you like
  it to be?

  8. Are there any specific applications from the dataset that you want to highlight
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, include a legend. The placement could be on the right.

  5. Data labels on each section would be great.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, the title could be "Distribution of TCP and UDP Packets Across Applications."

  8. I do not have any specific applications to highlight.'
