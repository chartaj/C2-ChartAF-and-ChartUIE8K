initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different network
  traffic features in the Android Malware dataset. Use columns like 'tcp_packets,'
  'dist_port_tcp,' 'external_ips,' 'volume_bytes,' 'udp_packets,' 'tcp_urg_packet,'
  'source_app_packets,' 'remote_app_packets,' 'source_app_bytes,' 'remote_app_bytes,'
  'duration,' 'avg_local_pkt_rate,' 'avg_remote_pkt_rate,' 'dns_query_times,' and
  'type.' Highlight which features most strongly correlate with the 'type' to identify
  patterns of benign and malicious traffic. Make sure to handle any non-numeric data
  appropriately and clearly label the axes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like non-numeric data (e.g., ''type'') to be handled or represented
  in the heatmap?

  3. Would you prefer any particular scaling method for the data (e.g., normalization,
  standardization)?

  4. Are there specific axis labels or annotations you would like to include or customize?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the display of the correlation coefficients (e.g.,
  display as text on each cell)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color gradient and correlation
  coefficients?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the network traffic features on the axes?

  8. Are there any specific features or correlations you would like to highlight or
  annotate particularly?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Please encode ''type'' as numeric values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, display the correlation coefficients as text on each cell.

  6. Yes, include a legend explaining the color gradient and correlation coefficients.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Please particularly highlight the correlations with the ''type'' feature.'
