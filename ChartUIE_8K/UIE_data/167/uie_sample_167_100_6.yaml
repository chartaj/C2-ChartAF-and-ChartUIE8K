initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart to visualize the ðŸ«€ Heart Disease Dataset. The
  x-axis should represent the ''age'' groups, and the y-axis should show the average
  ''cholesterol'' levels within each age group. Moreover, use different colors to
  distinguish between the ''sex'' categories (0: Female, 1: Male). This will help
  us understand how cholesterol levels vary with age and gender among heart disease
  patients. Make sure to include a legend for clarity. The chart should give a clear
  picture of cholesterol trends across different age groups and between males and
  females in the dataset.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  between male and female categories?

  2. What age group intervals would you like to use on the x-axis (e.g., 5-year intervals,
  10-year intervals)?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the age groups on the x-axis (ascending or
  descending)?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations added to the bars?

  5. Is there a particular font type or size you prefer for the chart labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for better readability? If
  yes, do you have a preference for their style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  7. Do you have any specific preference for the chart title and the axes titles?

  8. Should the bars be displayed as grouped bars or stacked bars for male and female
  categories?

  9. Would you like any specific legend placement (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)?

  10. Do you require any specific margin or padding settings to optimize readability
  and appearance?'
