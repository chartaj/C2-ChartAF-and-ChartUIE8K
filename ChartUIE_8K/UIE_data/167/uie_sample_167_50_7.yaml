  +/- 0.7)?

  4. Do you need a legend to explain the colors used in the heatmap?

  5. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include any annotations or notes for specific correlations?'
