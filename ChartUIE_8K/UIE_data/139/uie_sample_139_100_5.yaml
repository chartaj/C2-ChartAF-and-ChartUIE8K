initial_prompt: I want a histogram that visualizes the distribution of inflation_annual_cpi
  values from the Africa Economic, Banking and Systemic Crisis Data. The x-axis should
  represent the inflation_annual_cpi values, and the y-axis should show the frequency
  of those values. Please provide bins that properly capture the range and variability
  of the data. This will help us understand the historical inflation trends in various
  African countries over different years. Ensure that the histogram is clear and well-labeled.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  3. What should be the labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a specific number of bins for the histogram, or should it be determined
  based on the data range?

  5. Would you like to add any annotations or markers on the histogram for specific
  data points or ranges?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, even though it''s a single-variable histogram?

  8. Should the histogram include grid lines for better readability?'

  4. It should be determined based on the data range.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.
