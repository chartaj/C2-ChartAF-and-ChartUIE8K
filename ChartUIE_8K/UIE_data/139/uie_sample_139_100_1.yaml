initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the occurrences of systemic crises
  in African countries over different years. Use colors to highlight countries with
  varying numbers of crises. Include text annotations for countries with the highest
  and lowest occurrences to draw attention to these specific elements. The map should
  provide an insightful overview of economic, banking, and systemic crises across
  Africa from 1870 to 1972, helping viewers quickly identify patterns and hotspots.
  Add highlights to emphasize the years and countries with significant crisis events
  while maintaining a clear, informative layout.

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or highlights apart from

  8. Are there any specific constraints regarding the number of colors or gradients
  used in the choropleth map?'
