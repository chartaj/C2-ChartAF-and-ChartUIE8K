2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart to visualize the relationship between y, x1, and x2. Display
  y on the y-axis and both x1 and x2 on the x-axis for comparison. Add text annotations
  to highlight key data points along the lines where y changes significantly. Use
  highlights to differentiate the lines for x1 and x2, making it easy to distinguish
  them. This visualization will help analyze the correlation and trends between the
  variables, which is crucial for understanding underlying patterns and making informed
  decisions.
