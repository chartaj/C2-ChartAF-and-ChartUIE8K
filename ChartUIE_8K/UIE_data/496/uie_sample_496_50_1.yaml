initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize relationships in
  the dataset. Include text annotations highlighting key values to guide interpretation.
  Incorporate highlights to distinguish among columns y, x1, and x2. Use this to discern
  patterns and correlations effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the highlights among columns
  y, x1, and x2?

  2. Do you prefer specific text annotations for key values or should they be automatically
  generated based on the data?

  3. How would you like the axes to be scaled: independently or uniformly across all
  variables?

  4. Should we include markers or legends to identify specific data points or groups
  of data points?

  5. Do you have any preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) used to represent
  different columns?

  6. Are there any specific patterns or correlations you expect and would like to
  focus on in the visualization?'
