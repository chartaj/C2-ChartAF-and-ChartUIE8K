initial_prompt: I need a parallel coordinates plot to visualize the data where each
  line represents an observation. The lines should display how variables 'y', 'x1',
  and 'x2' change across dimensions. Include data-driven text annotations to highlight
  key observations for 'x1' and 'x2'. It's essential to draw attention to values showing
  significant differences. Also, apply highlights to these elements to make them stand
  out. The visualization should help in identifying trends or patterns in these variables,
  which is crucial for understanding the relationships among 'y', 'x1', and 'x2' in
  analytical contexts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the highlights and text annotations?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for key observations to be displayed
  (e.g., font size, placement)?

  3. Are there any specific thresholds for ''significant differences'' that should
  be highlighted?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the axis scaling or normalization for the
  parallel coordinates plot?

  5. Should the lines be smoothed or retain their raw form when representing the observations?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you want included in the chart?

  7. How detailed or granular would you like the highlights to be within the dataset
  (e.g., top 5% extremes, outliers beyond a standard deviation)?

  8. Do you prefer a certain style for the lines (e.g., dotted, solid, varying thickness)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Significant differences can be highlighted based on the top 5% extreme values.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Retain their raw form when representing the observations.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Highlight the top 5% extremes as well as any clear outliers.

  8. A solid line style would be preferred.'
