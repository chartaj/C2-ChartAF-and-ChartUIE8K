initial_prompt: Visualize the dataset using a heatmap to highlight correlations among
  'y', 'x1', and 'x2'. Use text annotations for the highest and lowest correlation
  values to draw attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Do you have a specific format or font preference for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations for the highest and lowest correlation values be
  in bold or highlighted in any way?

  5. Do you prefer a specific range of correlation values (e.g., -1 to 1) to be highlighted
  in different colors?

  6. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding of the correlations?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like the axis labels to be formatted or oriented?

  8. Do you want the heatmap to display values within the cells?'
