initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the relationship between y, x1, and
  x2. Display y on the y-axis and both x1 and x2 on the x-axis for comparison. Add
  text annotations to highlight key data points along the lines where y changes significantly.
  Use highlights to differentiate the lines for x1 and x2, making it easy to distinguish
  them. This visualization will help analyze the correlation and trends between the
  variables, which is crucial for understanding underlying patterns and making informed
  decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing x1
  and x2?

  2. What specific events or thresholds should trigger text annotations for significant
  changes in y?

  3. How would you like us to style the highlights that differentiate between the
  lines for x1 and x2 (e.g., dashed lines, different thickness, or markers)?

  4. Do you have a preferred placement for the legend in the chart?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be both horizontal
  and vertical or only one of these?

  6. Is there a specific ordering or sorting you would prefer for the data points
  along the x-axis?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations and
  labels?

  8. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the x-axis, y-axis, and
  the overall chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Different thickness.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart, both horizontal and vertical.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
