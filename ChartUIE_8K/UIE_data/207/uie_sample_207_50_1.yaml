initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot visualizing the given data, highlighting
  RM vs. MEDV. Annotate key points showing high and low MEDV values to emphasize their
  significance. Ensure the visualization focuses on real-estate analysis.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the high and\
  \ low MEDV values?\n2. Would you like specific annotations or labels for high and\
  \ low MEDV values, or should they be automatically generated?\n3. Should the annotations\
  \ for high and low MEDV values include detailed information such as exact values\
  \ and room numbers (RM)?\n4. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for\
  \ the annotations (e.g., callouts, tooltips, labels)?\n5. Do you want grid lines\
  \ on the plot for better readability of data points?\n6. How would you like to differentiate\
  \ between high and low MEDV values (e.g., color, size, shape)?\n7. Do you have any\
  \ specific preferences for the axis labels and title of the plot? \n8. Should the\
  \ chart include a legend explaining the colors or symbols used for high and low\
  \ MEDV values?"
