initial_prompt: I have a dataset showing Boston housing metrics, including rooms per
  dwelling (RM), percent lower status of the population (LSTAT), pupil-teacher ratio
  (PTRATIO), and median value of homes (MEDV). I need a donut chart to visualize this
  data clearly. Specifically, I want the chart to illustrate the distribution of these
  key metrics. Please ensure it reflects the uniqueness and range of each value accurately.
  Use color coding for each metric, and include a legend for clarity. This visualization
  will help in understanding the composition of the different features in the dataset.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color coding of each
  metric?

  2. Would you like to customize the labels for each segment of the donut chart?

  3. Is there a specific font or font size you prefer for the legend and labels?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the order in which the metrics (RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO,
  MEDV) are displayed in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart?

  6. Do you prefer a particular style for the donut chart (e.g., 2D, 3D, minimalist)?

  7. What level of detail would you like for the tooltips (e.g., exact values, percentages,
  additional metrics)?'
