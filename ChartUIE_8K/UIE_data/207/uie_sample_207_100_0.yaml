initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of RM values in the
  Boston Housing dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the mean and median RM
  values. Make sure to highlight the bins containing these values to draw attention
  to average housing room numbers. The purpose is to understand the typical number
  of rooms in homes within the dataset, which can be useful for real-estate analysis.
  Add a brief description of the features annotated to provide context for viewers.
  The chart should be easy to interpret for real-estate professionals and data analysts.
