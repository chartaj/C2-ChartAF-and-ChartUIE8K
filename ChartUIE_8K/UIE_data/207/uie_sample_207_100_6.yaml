initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart using the Boston Housing dataset. I would
  like the chart to display the proportion of unique values for the columns 'RM',
  'LSTAT', 'PTRATIO', and 'MEDV'. Each section of the pie chart should represent one
  of these columns. The purpose is to visually compare how many unique values each
  column has in relation to the whole dataset. Ensure that the chart is clearly labeled
  and easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or themes for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include percentage labels on each slice?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend or should the slices be directly labeled?

  4. What title would you like for the pie chart?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the labels and
  title?

  6. Would you prefer the chart to have any specific border or background style?

  7. Do you want any additional annotations or highlights on specific slices?

  8. Should the slices be ordered in any particular way (e.g., largest to smallest,
  alphabetically)?

  9. Is there a specific size or dimension you would prefer for the chart?'
