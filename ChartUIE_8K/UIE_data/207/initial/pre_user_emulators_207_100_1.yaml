  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\

  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually.\n<end of the annotation\

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Let's create a dot plot using the provided Boston Housing dataset. X-axis represents
  'RM' (average number of rooms per dwelling) and Y-axis represents 'MEDV' (Median
  value of owner-occupied homes in USD). Use 'LSTAT' (lower status of the population)
  and 'PTRATIO' (pupil-teacher ratio) as annotations for each dot to highlight housing
  quality and education access. This visualization will help analyze the relationship
  between room numbers and property value, emphasizing areas with diverse economic
  statuses and education levels. Include highlights on points where 'MEDV' is exceptionally
  high or low to focus on outliers.
