initial_prompt: I need a column chart to compare the average number of rooms (RM)
  with the median value of homes (MEDV) across the dataset. Display RM on the x-axis
  and MEDV on the y-axis. Group data by LSTAT and color-code by different PTRATIO.
  The vertical bars should represent the price of the homes, and the colors should
  help differentiate between various PTRATIO values. Add a title like "Relationship
  Between Number of Rooms, Median Value, and PTRATIO." Ensure it's easy to read and
  understand since I'm using this for a real estate market analysis in Boston. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the title and axis
  labels?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include data labels for each bar to show the exact MEDV values?

  4. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to differentiate PTRATIO
  values?

  5. Would you like to have a legend included to explain the color-coding for PTRATIO?

  6. Do you have a specific order for sorting the RM values on the x-axis?

  7. Should the chart include any annotations or additional notes?

  8. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the axis labels?'
