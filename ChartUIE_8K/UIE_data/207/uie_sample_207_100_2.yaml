initial_prompt: 'Please create a box chart visualizing the Boston Housing data. Include
  boxes for each column: RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO, and MEDV to show distribution. Use text
  annotations to highlight key data points in each box, particularly the median values.
  Additionally, use highlights to emphasize any outliers in the dataset. This will
  help in understanding the spread and central tendencies of the housing attributes.
  The goal is to make it easy to identify patterns and outliers within these real
  estate features. Ensure the chart is clear and interpretable for a general audience
  interested in real estate data.'

  PTRATIO, MEDV) to be presented?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific preference for the background color of the chart?

  7. Should there be specific titles or labels for each of the axes?
