initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing data from the Boston Housing dataset.
  Please plot 'RM' on the x-axis and 'MEDV' on the y-axis to show the relationship
  between the average number of rooms per dwelling and the median value of homes in
  USD. Color the points based on 'LSTAT' to reflect the percentage of lower status
  of the population, using a gradient where lower 'LSTAT' values are blue and higher
  'LSTAT' values are red. Additionally, include 'PTRATIO' as a size variable for the
  pointsâ€”bigger points for higher pupil-teacher ratio values. Titles and labels should
  be clear for all axes and legend.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for ''LSTAT'' other than the
  suggested blue to red gradient?

  2. Would you prefer a specific size range for the points based on ''PTRATIO''?

  3. Should the scatter plot include a trend line to better visualize the relationship
  between ''RM'' and ''MEDV''?

  4. Do you have specific preferences for the plot background, such as grid style
  or background color?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the titles, labels,
  and legend?

  6. Should the chart include any annotations or notes on specific points or areas
  of interest?

  7. Would you like to set any axis range or limits for ''RM'' and ''MEDV''?'
