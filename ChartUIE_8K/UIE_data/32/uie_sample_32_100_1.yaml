initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the Medical Cost Personal Datasets
  to visualize the distribution of 'charges' across different 'regions'. Highlight
  regions with higher charges using more intense colors. Add text annotations to show
  average charges in each region, focusing on significantly high or low values to
  draw attention. The goal is to identify regional cost disparities and potential
  correlations with factors like 'bmi', 'smoker', and 'children'. This will help in
  understanding regional healthcare expenses and guide policy or insurance-related
  decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the geographic heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific color intensity range to highlight regions with higher
  charges?

  3. Is there a specific map projection or geographic layout you prefer?

  4. Do you want custom labels or specific formatting for the text annotations showing
  average charges?

  5. Should the map include a legend or key to indicate the color scale and its meaning?

  6. Are there any specific regions you want to emphasize or give more focus to in
  the visualization?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  8. Would you like to include any additional data points or markers on the map aside
  from the color intensity and text annotations?

  9. Should the map include any borders, graticules, or other geographical features
  to enhance readability?

  10. Are there any specific chart titles or captions you would like to include?'
