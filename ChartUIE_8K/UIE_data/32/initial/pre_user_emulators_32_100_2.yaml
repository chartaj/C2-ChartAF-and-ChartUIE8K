  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually.\n<end of the annotation\

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a bar chart to visualize the number of children versus the average medical
  charges. Please annotate the highest and lowest average charges. Highlight bars
  representing smokers versus non-smokers to see the cost impact. This chart is for
  analyzing personal medical costs and should focus on differentiating between smokers
  and non-smokers across different regions aged 18 to 28. Use distinct colors for
  each region to make comparisons easier. This visualization helps in understanding
  how smoking status and region influence medical expenses for families with varying
  numbers of children.
