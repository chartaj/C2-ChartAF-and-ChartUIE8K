- Create a geographic heatmap showcasing medical costs from different regions. Highlight
  regions with the highest charges, especially for smokers. Annotate specific data
  points for age, sex, and smoker status. Use color intensity to depict charge variations
  across regions, making it easier to identify high-cost areas.
