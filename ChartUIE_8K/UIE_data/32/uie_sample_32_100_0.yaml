initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages in the medical
  cost personal dataset. Highlight different age groups and add text annotations displaying
  the average charges for each group. Annotate any outliers in the age distribution.
  This visualization will help in identifying the age demographics that incur higher
  medical expenses, providing valuable insights for business analysis. Focus on making
  the histogram visually engaging and informative, leveraging highlights to emphasize
  key data points and trends within the age groups. Additionally, ensure the chart
  is easy to understand for stakeholders without a statistical background.
