02_initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart visualizing information from the provided
  astronaut data. Specifically, I want to see a comparison of the total hours spent
  on missions by each astronaut. The x-axis should represent the astronauts' names,
  while the y-axis should show their total mission hours. This chart should help me
  visualize which astronauts have the highest mission hours, which could correlate
  with their experience and time spent in space, reflecting the context of traveling
  to outer space. Can you please create this bar chart for me? Thanks!
