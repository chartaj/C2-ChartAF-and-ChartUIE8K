initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing astronauts' missions by nationality.
  Highlight countries with the most missions using different color intensities. Annotate
  key countries to show the total number of missions and significant astronauts like
  Yuri Gagarin (U.S.S.R/Russia), John Glenn (U.S.), and their mission details. The
  visualization will help to understand the global distribution of astronaut missions
  and spotlight nations with significant contributions to space travel, providing
  insights into historical space exploration efforts. Include text annotations for
  countries with fewer but significant missions, showing the importance of their contributions.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the map use a particular projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.)?

  3. Do you have a preferred format for the text annotations?

  4. Are there any specific countries, besides the U.S.S.R/Russia and the U.S., that
  you want to be highlighted or annotated?

  5. How detailed would you like the mission details to be for the key astronauts?

  6. Should the map include a legend to explain the color intensities?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations?

  8. Are there any specific time periods or historical contexts you want to emphasize?

  9. How would you like the data to be segmented? By year, decade, or another time
  frame?

  10. Do you want any additional data layers, such as geopolitical borders or other
  contextual information?'
