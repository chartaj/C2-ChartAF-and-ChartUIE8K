initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between the year
  of selection and the total number of missions for astronauts. The x-axis should
  represent the year of selection, and the y-axis should represent the total number
  of missions. Each point should be an astronaut, with additional color-coding by
  nationality to distinguish between different countries. This will help us understand
  how the selection year might influence the number of missions undertaken and also
  highlight trends between different nationalities over time in space exploration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the nationality color-coding?

  2. Do you want any specific legends or labels on the chart?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for easier data reading?

  4. Would you prefer the data points to have specific shapes or sizes based on other
  attributes?

  5. Do you want to include a trend line to help visualize any correlations?

  6. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the chart text?

  7. Do you need tooltips or annotations on hover to show additional information about
  each astronaut?

  8. Are there specific axis ranges you want to set for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, modern,
  professional)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, I would like specific legends or labels related to the nationalities.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, including a trend line would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not need tooltips or annotations.

  8. I do not have specific axis ranges in mind.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
