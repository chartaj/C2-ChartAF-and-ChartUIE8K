initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing methane emissions for China and Russia from
  1990 to 2018. Use years as the x-axis and emissions values as the color intensity.
  Include "Total including LUCF" and "Total excluding LUCF" for the sectors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How do you want to differentiate between the sectors ''Total including LUCF''
  and ''Total excluding LUCF'' on the heatmap?

  3. Should the heatmap include gridlines to separate years for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of color intensities to represent the
  emissions values?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to denote color intensities and their corresponding
  emissions values?

  6. Should the country names (China and Russia) be displayed directly on the heatmap,
  or prefer to use additional labels?

  7. Do you want to include any specific annotations or labels on the heatmap to highlight
  particular years or emissions values?

  8. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend
  text?

  9. Should any specific year range be emphasized more compared to others in the heatmap?

  10. Do you want to see the exact emission values on the heatmap cells, if feasible,
  for each year or sector?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. ''Total including LUCF'' and ''Total excluding LUCF'' could be differentiated
  using different shades or patterns, but I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to denote color intensities and their corresponding
  emissions values.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I don''t have a preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, if feasible, please include the exact emission values on the heatmap cells.'
