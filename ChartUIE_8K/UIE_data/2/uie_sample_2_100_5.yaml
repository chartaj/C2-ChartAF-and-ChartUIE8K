initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart showcasing global methane emissions from
  1990 to 2018. Use the columns "Country," "Sector," and "2018" to "1990" values.
  Differentiating between "Total including LUCF" and "Total excluding LUCF" sectors
  per country, focus on highlighting the emission differences. Ensure each country's
  contribution is clearly visible across the years. This visualization aims to depict
  how methane emissions have evolved globally over time, emphasizing key emission
  sources and trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different sectors or
  countries?

  2. Should the x-axis be labeled with each individual year from 1990 to 2018, or
  would you prefer a different labeling interval (e.g., every 5 years)?

  3. Would you like a reference line or marker indicating any significant events or
  milestones in the data?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the chart include a title and subtitle, and if so, do you have any specific
  wording in mind?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight
  specific trends or data points?

  7. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. Should the vertical scale (y-axis) be linear or logarithmic?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific colors.

  2. I do not know, perhaps labeling every 5 years could work?

  3. I am not sure about reference lines or markers.

  4. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  5. Yes, please include a title "Global Methane Emissions (1990-2018)" and a subtitle
  "Including and Excluding LUCF Sectors".

  6. I am not sure about annotations.

  7. I do not know, maybe the legend could be placed at the bottom?

  8. I am not sure, but a linear scale might be easier to understand.'
