initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize Methane emissions globally from
  1990 to 2018. Use the "Country" column for geographic locations and yearly columns
  to show emission levels. Highlight trends over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the map use a sequential or divergent color scheme?

  3. Do you want specific year labels displayed on the map?

  4. Would you prefer a single map with an animation over the years, or multiple maps

  6. Should the map include country borders or other geographic boundary markers?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map''s projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. Would you like to display specific data points or annotations on the map for
  significant events or outliers?

  9. Should there be a title and subtitle for the map? If yes, please provide the
  text.

  10. Do you require any additional information to be displayed when hovering over
  a country (e.g., emissions data for selected years)?'
