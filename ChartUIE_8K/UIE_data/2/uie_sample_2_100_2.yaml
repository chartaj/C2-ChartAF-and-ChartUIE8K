initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize methane emissions (CH4) from 1990
  to 2018 for different sectors in China and Russia. Use year as the x-axis and methane
  emissions (MTCO2e) as the y-axis. Include text annotations to highlight key data
  points in 2018, focusing on the total emissions including LUCF for China and Russia.
  Use different colors for China and Russia to make them visually distinct. Purpose:
  Highlight trends in methane emissions over the years and compare the two countries''
  emission patterns. Title: "Methane Emissions Around The World (1990-2018)".'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing China and
  Russia in the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for text annotations on the chart?

  3. Should the text annotations for key data points in 2018 include additional information
  (e.g., exact emission values)?

  4. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability of the data
  points?

  5. Are there any specific label formats you prefer for the x-axis (years) and y-axis
  (methane emissions) values?

  6. Would you like to include a legend specifying the colors used for China and Russia?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed, professional, etc.)?

  8. Should the scatter plot markers have any specific shape (e.g., circles, squares,
