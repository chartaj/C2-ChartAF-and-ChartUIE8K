initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing methane emissions (CH4) from
  different countries across years (1990-2018). Highlight significant differences
  in emissions between the sectors 'Total including LUCF' and 'Total excluding LUCF'.
  Include trends and noticeable peaks with annotations for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the grouped bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like to set specific colors for the different sectors, such as ''Total
  including LUCF'' and ''Total excluding LUCF''?

  3. Should we use a specific type of annotations for highlighting trends and noticeable
  peaks, such as arrows or labels?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the years (x-axis) to be formatted, such
  as showing every year or grouping them by intervals (like every 5 years)?

  5. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., countries alphabetically
  or by emission values)?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the background to help with comparison,
  and if so, in what style?

  7. Are there any specific font types or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have any specific preferences
  for its placement (e.g., top, bottom, right, or left of the chart)?

  9. Do you want to use any specific data labels directly on the bars to show the
  exact emission values?

  10. Is there any additional contextual information or annotations you would like
  included in the chart towards the bottom or any other part of the chart?'
