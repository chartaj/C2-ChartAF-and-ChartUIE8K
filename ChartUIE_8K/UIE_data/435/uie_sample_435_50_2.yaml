  4. Do you have a specific style for the data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  5. Should the chart include a title and legend? If so, what should they say?

  6. What size should the overall chart be?

  7. Do you prefer a specific placement for the annotations on the chart?

  8. Would you like any additional labels or axes titles on the chart?

  9. Is there a specific format for the date (year) axis that you prefer (e.g., every
  year, every five years)?

  10. Would you like the top artist emphasized in a unique way (e.g., different color
  or size) on the annotations?'
