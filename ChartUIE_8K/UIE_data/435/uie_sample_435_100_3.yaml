initial_prompt: I want to visualize the distribution of points scored by the top hip-hop
  artists in BBC's Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time list. Use a box plot to show
  the spread of points across different years and genders. This will help identify
  any trends in how points are distributed among male and female artists over time.
  Please include clear labels for the axes, with years on the x-axis, and points on
  the y-axis. Make sure to also highlight any outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different genders (e.g.,
  male and female)?

  2. Would you prefer any particular style or font for the labels on the axes?

  3. Are there any specific years you want to highlight or emphasize more in the box
  plot?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the y-axis (horizontal or vertical)?

  5. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color?

  6. Do you want any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or text you would like to include on the
  chart (e.g., mean or median lines, specific data points)?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout or size for the chart to fit into a publication
  or presentation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a preference for the orientation.

  5. I think marking the outliers with a specific symbol or color would be good.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have a preference.'
