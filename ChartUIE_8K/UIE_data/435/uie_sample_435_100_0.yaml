initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the top artists in the BBC Greatest
  Hip-Hop songs of all time. Use the 'points' column to represent the intensity of
  the heatmap, highlighting the highest-scoring songs. Annotate high points values
  to draw attention. Ensure distinct color variations to emphasize differences in
  points among songs. Display axis labels for 'artist' and 'title' for clarity. Include
  gender differences if relevant to visualize. Highlight artists with multiple top
  songs. Use annotations and highlights to focus viewers' attention on key data points
  and trends in hip-hop music over the years.

  angled)?
