initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the data of top hip-hop artists as
  per the BBC Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time. The x-axis should represent the
  years and the y-axis should represent the points scored by each song. Use different
  colors to represent different artists. This will help in understanding how different
  artists performed over the years. Include highlights to emphasize artists with the
  highest points and use text annotations to display specific values for songs with
  the highest rankings. The visualization aims to identify trends, standout years,
  and artist performances over time.
