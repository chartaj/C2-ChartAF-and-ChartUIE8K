initial_prompt: 'Create a tile map visualizing the trade volume between countries,
  focusing on six key nations: USA, China, Germany, Brazil, Japan, and India. Use
  color gradients to represent trade volume values, with annotations highlighting
  significant trade relationships to draw attention to notable data points. Ensure
  that no values are missing, considering all data is complete. Emphasize the visual
  distinction between high and low trade volumes through highlights, modifying color
  intensity appropriately. The visualization should provide context for governmental
  analysis of global trade relationships, aiming to identify strategic trade partnerships
  and areas for economic development.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or specific color gradients
  for representing trade volumes?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to represent specific thresholds for trade
  volumes, and if so, what are those thresholds?

  3. How would you prefer the annotations to be displayed on the tile map to highlight
  significant trade relationships?

  4. Are there specific labels or descriptive text you would like included in the
  visualization to provide additional context?

  5. Do you prefer the tile sizes to be uniform, or should they be adjusted based
  on trade volume or another metric?

  6. Is there a particular layout or arrangement of the six key nations that you prefer
  on the tile map?

  7. Would you like each country to be represented with specific shapes or icons,
  or should it strictly be a tile-based representation?

  8. Are there any additional data points or contextual information you want included
  to further assist in governmental analysis?'
