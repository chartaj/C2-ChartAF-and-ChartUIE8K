02_initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the trade volume between different countries
  using a heatmap. The data includes trade volumes between the USA, China, Germany,
  Brazil, Japan, and India. Since each cell represents trade volumes, a heatmap with
  varying color intensities will be ideal. For instance, cells representing higher
  trade volumes should have a darker shade, and lower volumes should be lighter. This
  will help to quickly grasp which countries have the highest and lowest trade interactions.
  Could you please create this heatmap for me and ensure each country is clearly labeled
  on both axes? Thanks!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
