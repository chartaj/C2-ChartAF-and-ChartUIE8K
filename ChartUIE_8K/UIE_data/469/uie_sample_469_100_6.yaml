initial_prompt: 'Please create a pie chart visualizing the data from the dataset.
  The chart should show the share of CO2 emissions from air travel and the share of
  world population for different income countries. Use distinct colors for each category:
  "High income countries," "Upper-middle income countries," and "Lower-middle income
  countries." Ensure that the chart is easy to read, with labeled slices and a legend
  for clarity. This will help in understanding the environmental impact of air travel
  among different income groups. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific colors to be used for each
  income category?

  2. Would you like to have the shares of CO2 emissions and world population shown
  on the same pie chart or separate pie charts?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like to include percentage values on the slices in addition to the
  category names?

  5. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the pie chart?

  6. Do you want to emphasize any specific category in a unique way, such as using
  a different shade or adding an annotation?'
