initial_prompt: Create a waffle chart that visualizes the share of CO2 emissions from
  air travel and the share of world population. Use the categories "High income countries,"
  "Upper-middle income countries," and "Lower-middle income countries" as labels.
  The chart should clearly show the percentage contributions of each category to both
  CO2 emissions and the world population, side by side, for easy comparison. Make
  sure it is easy to distinguish between the two datasets, perhaps using different
  colors for each dataset. This is for an environmental science project, so accuracy
  and clarity are crucial.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors to represent
  the CO2 emissions and world population datasets?

  2. Would you like the waffle chart to include any specific labeling styles or font
  preferences for the income categories?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to help distinguish between the datasets, or
  would you like the differences to be depicted through other means?

  4. Do you prefer the data in the chart to be displayed with numerical values or
  just percentage bars?

  5. Are there any specific sizes or dimensions you prefer for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the grid size of the waffle chart, such as 10x10
  or another specification?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme or specific colors, whatever looks
  clear and visually appealing is fine.

  2. I am not sure about specific labeling styles or font preferences, just make sure
  it''s easy to read.

  3. I think including a legend would be helpful to distinguish between the datasets.

  4. I prefer the data to be displayed with percentage values.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure about the grid size, but a 10x10 grid sounds good.'
