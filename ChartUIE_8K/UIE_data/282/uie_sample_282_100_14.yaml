initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the Nationality, Gender, and
  Estimated Net Worth of celebrities listed in the 2023 Celebrity Net Worth dataset.
  Categorize the bars by Nationality and stack them by Gender. The y-axis should represent
  the Estimated Net Worth in billions of dollars, and the x-axis should list the Nationalities.
  This chart will help understand the distribution of wealth among different genders
  and nationalities. Use vibrant colors to differentiate the genders within each nationality
  for better clarity. Ensure the values are clearly labeled for easy interpretation.

  each nationality?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and values?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the y-axis values (e.g., number
  format, decimal places)?

  placement?'
