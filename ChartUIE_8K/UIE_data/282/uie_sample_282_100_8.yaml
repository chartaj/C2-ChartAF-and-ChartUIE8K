initial_prompt: I need a treemap chart visualizing the net worth of celebrities listed
  in the dataset "2023 Celebrity Net Worth" related to astrology. The chart should
  categorize celebs by Industry, showing the distribution of their Estimated Net Worth
  within each category. Represent the Nationality and Gender as subcategories for
  an in-depth view. Make sure to highlight the variations in Net Worth prominently.
