initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the 'Target' column from the data,
  showing the count of 'Dropout' and 'Graduate' students. Additionally, use the 'Age
  at enrollment' to create a second bar chart representing the average age of 'Dropout'
  and 'Graduate' students. Make sure the x-axis represents the categories ('Dropout'
  and 'Graduate'), and the y-axis represents the counts or averages. Visualize how
  different factors impact studentsâ€™ outcomes. This helps in understanding the distribution
  and identifying the key factors contributing to dropouts and graduations.
