initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the dataset provided. The chart should
  visualize the distribution of students by their "Age at enrollment" and use different
  colors to distinguish between those who "Dropout" and those who "Graduate" as indicated
  in the "Target" column. This will help in understanding if age plays a role in students'
  academic outcomes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  2. Which color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing between "Dropout" and
  "Graduate"?

  3. Should the histogram include a legend to identify the colors representing "Dropout"
  and "Graduate"?

  4. Do you want the histogram to display counts or percentages on the y-axis?

  5. Is there a specific ordering for the age groups you would like to see on the
  x-axis (e.g., ascending, descending)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included for easier interpretation of values?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  8. Should the chart include any additional annotations or markers, such as mean
  or median lines for age distributions?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Yes, a legend to identify the colors representing "Dropout" and "Graduate" would
  be helpful.

  4. Displaying counts on the y-axis would be preferable.

  5. Ascending ordering for the age groups on the x-axis would be good.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.'
