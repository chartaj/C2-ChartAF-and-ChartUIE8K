initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize students' academic success
  and dropout rates. Use different colors to represent 'Dropout' and 'Graduate' statuses.
  Highlight elements like 'Age at enrollment', 'Gender', and 'Marital status' to see
  their influence on the target variable. Annotate specific bars with values for clarity.
  This will help in predicting students' dropout and academic success. Include unemployment
  and inflation rates as contextual annotations to understand external economic influences.
  Use the sample data provided to structure the chart. Ensure it is visually engaging
  and emphasizes key insights.
