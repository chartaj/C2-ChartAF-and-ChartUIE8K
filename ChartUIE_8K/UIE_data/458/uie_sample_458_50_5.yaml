initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing different time points and
  their corresponding amplitude and other unnamed variables from the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  each variable in the radar chart?

  2. Would you like the radar chart to include grid lines for easier comparison between
  variables?

  3. How many concentric circles (levels) would you prefer within the radar chart
  for indicating value ranges?

  4. Do you prefer the axis labels (for different variables) to be inside or outside
  the radar chart?

  5. Would you like to include markers at each data point on the radar lines?

  6. Should the radar chart display a legend to identify each variable clearly?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the scaling of the axes in the radar chart?

  8. Would you like to see the data points (amplitude and unnamed variables) connected
  in a filled polygon or just as outline lines?

  9. Should the radar chart be titled or include any additional annotations for context?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or styling preferences you would like for the text
  elements in the chart?'
