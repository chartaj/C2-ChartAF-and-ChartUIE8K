initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between all columns
  in the provided dataset. This should include 'Time(sec)', 'Amplitude(a.u.)', and
  the unnamed columns to reveal patterns and relationships.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display the correlation values within the heatmap cells?

  3. Should the heatmap include a color bar legend to indicate the correlation value
  ranges?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include for the
  unnamed columns?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font size or style for axis labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like to highlight any particular correlation threshold (e.g., above
  0.8 or below -0.8)?

  7. Are there any grid lines or borders preferences for the heatmap cells?

  8. Do you want to include a title or subtitle for the heatmap? If so, what should
  they be?

  9. Should the heatmap support tooltips that show additional information when hovering
  over a cell?'
