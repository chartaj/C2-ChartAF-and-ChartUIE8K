09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have specific thresholds in mind, but significant peaks or dips would
  be good.

  3. I would prefer the text annotations to be clearly readable with a medium font
  size and positioned close to the highlighted data points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I would prefer solid lines for clarity.

  6. Both vertical and horizontal grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I have no specific preference for the legend placement.

  8. A clear title for the chart and labels for the axes would be great.'
