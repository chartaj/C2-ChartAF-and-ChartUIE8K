initial_prompt: Visualize this data as a multi-line chart showing amplitude variations
  over time. Highlight significant peaks. Annotate outliers or unusual patterns. Ensure
  clear differentiation between data series with colors. The chart is for a physics
  presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between data
  series?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding of each data series?

  3. Is there a specific labeling style you prefer for the x-axis (time) and y-axis
  (amplitude)?

  4. Are there any specific threshold values for peaks and outliers that you want
  to be highlighted?

  5. What type of annotations would you prefer for outliers or unusual patterns (e.g.,
  text labels, arrows)?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for easier readability?

  7. Do you have a preferred line style or line thickness for the data series?

  8. Would you like to include markers at data points for better visibility?

  9. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If yes, do you have specific text
  in mind?

  10. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels
  and annotations?'
