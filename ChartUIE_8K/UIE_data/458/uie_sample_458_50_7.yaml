initial_prompt: 'Create a bubble chart with ''Time(sec)'' on the x-axis and ''Amplitude(a.u.)''
  on the y-axis. Use ''Unnamed: 2'' values for bubble size to analyze correlations
  in the physics experiment data.'
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bubbles or background?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  3. Do you need a legend to describe the bubble sizes?

  4. Should the chart include axis labels and titles? If so, do you have preferred
  names?

  5. Would you like to include data labels on the bubbles?

  6. What range would you like for the x-axis and y-axis (if any)?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  8. Are there any specific visual styles or themes you prefer for the chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, vibrant, scientific)?

  9. Would you like to include trend lines or any other statistical indicators on
  the chart?'
