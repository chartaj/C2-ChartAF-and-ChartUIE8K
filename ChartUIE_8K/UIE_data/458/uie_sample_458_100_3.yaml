initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap using the data from the provided CSV file.
  Each column represents different amplitude values measured at various time intervals.
  Map the ''Time(sec)'' on the x-axis and label each unnamed column (''Unnamed: 2'',
  ''Unnamed: 3'', etc.) accordingly on the y-axis to show their amplitude values.
  Highlight differences in amplitude visually to easily identify variations and patterns
  between the measurements. The heatmap should clearly illustrate these relationships,
  making it easy to spot correlations or anomalies in the data. Ensure the heatmap
  is color-coded for better interpretation. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a color gradient to represent the amplitude values? If so, do you
  have a preference for the range of colors?

  3. Is there a specific time range you are particularly interested in highlighting
  within the heatmap?

  4. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the heatmap for certain
  amplitude values or time intervals?

  5. Do you have a preferred method for scaling the color intensity (e.g., logarithmic,
  linear)?

  6. Should the heatmap include gridlines to separate different time intervals and
  amplitude columns?

  7. Are there any specific patterns or anomalies you are particularly looking to
  identify that we should prioritize in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Yes, use a color gradient. I do not have a preference for the range of colors.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Linear scaling would be fine.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines.

  7. I do not have specific patterns or anomalies in mind, just need to highlight
  variations and patterns effectively.'
