initial_prompt: I need an area chart to visualize the most streamed Spotify songs
  in 2024. For the chart, I'd like to see the "Track Score," "Spotify Streams," and
  "Spotify Playlist Reach" over the "All Time Rank." Make sure the chart shows how
  these metrics change over the ranks. Include a legend that clearly distinguishes
  between Track Score, Spotify Streams, and Spotify Playlist Reach. Also, please add
  appropriate axis labels and a title that reflects "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024."
  This will help visualize the popularity and reach of these tracks more effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the areas representing "Track
  Score," "Spotify Streams," and "Spotify Playlist Reach"?

  2. Would you like to apply any specific color palette or theme to the chart (e.g.,
  light, dark, pastel)?

  3. Do you prefer specific styles for the axis labels and title text (font type,
  size, color, etc.)?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, do you have any preferences for
  their style or color?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the formatting of the "Spotify Streams" and "Spotify
  Playlist Reach" values on the chart (e.g., commas for thousand separators)?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for specific ranks or metrics
  on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific layout or position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  right side)?

  8. Are there any additional details or data points you want to highlight or emphasize
  in the chart?'
