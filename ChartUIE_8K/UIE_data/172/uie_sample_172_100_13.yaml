initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024"
  data. Each dot should represent a song. The x-axis should display the track names,
  while the y-axis represents Spotify Streams. Color-code the dots based on the Artist.
  Ensure to include a legend for understanding the color-coding. Also, add data labels
  for the top 5 streamed songs. Adjust the plot to accommodate long track names and
  large stream values. Please consider the missing values and provide a clear plot
  with visible data points for better insights. Use a dark theme background for the
  plot.
