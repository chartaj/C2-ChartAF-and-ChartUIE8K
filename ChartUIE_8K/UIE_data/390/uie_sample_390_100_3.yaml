initial_prompt: Create a bar chart representing the collaboration network within the
  company. Utilize the 'group' column to showcase different departmental groups and
  their size. For each department, plot the number of unique IDs ('id' column) or
  names ('name' column). This will help visualize which departments have the most
  nodes in the collaborative network. Ensure that each bar in the chart has a distinct
  color to differentiate between departments. The chart should be labeled clearly,
  with the x-axis representing the departments and the y-axis representing the number
  of nodes.
