initial_prompt: I have a company collaboration network dataset from a business context,
  showing the relationships between different individuals within various groups. The
  data includes types (nodes), IDs, names, groups, sources, targets, and weights with
  some missing values. Please create a network diagram that visualizes the structure
  and connections within this network. Highlight the relationships between individuals
  and their groups, and use node size or color to represent weights where applicable.
  Ensure the diagram is clear and easy to interpret, showcasing the collaboration
  dynamics effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the network diagram (e.g., force-directed,
  circular, hierarchical)?

  2. What color scheme would you like to use for the nodes and edges?

  3. How would you prefer to represent the different groups (e.g., different node
  shapes, border colors)?

  4. Do you have a specific way you want to represent the weight of the connections
  (e.g., node size, edge thickness, edge color)?

  5. Would you like to include labels for the nodes, such as the names of the individuals?

  6. Do you want to display any specific group or individual prominently in the diagram?

  7. Are there any specific relationships or connections you would like to highlight
  within the network?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to be monochromatic or multicolored for better differentiation
  of elements?

  9. Is there a specific legend format you would like to use to explain the colors
  and sizes used in the diagram?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Different node shapes would be fine.

  4. Node size for representing weights would be good.

  5. Yes, I would like to include labels for the nodes, such as the names of the individuals.

  6. I do not have any specific group or individual in mind.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Multicolored for better differentiation of elements.

  9. I have no specific preference for the legend format.
