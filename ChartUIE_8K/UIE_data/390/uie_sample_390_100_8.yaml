initial_prompt: Create a network graph to visualize the Company Collaboration Network
  showing nodes for each individual (id, name, group) and edges for collaborations
  (source, target, weight). Highlight different groups with distinct colors and adjust
  edge thickness based on weight to reflect collaboration strength. Ensure missing
  values are handled appropriately, and label nodes clearly. Use this to understand
  collaboration patterns within the business context and identify key influencers
  in the network.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the layout of the network graph, such
  as force-directed, circular, or hierarchical?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating between groups?

  3. How would you like to handle missing values in the data?

  4. Should the node size vary based on any specific attribute, such as the number
  of connections or another metric?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the labeling of nodes (e.g., font size,
  font color, etc.)?

  6. Is there a particular way you''d like the edge thickness to be scaled based on
  the weight?

  7. Would you prefer any specific shapes for different groups of nodes?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you would like to include
  in the graph?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences regarding the overall style and aesthetics
  of the network graph?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, but maybe a force-directed layout would be good.

  2. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind; you can choose what works best
  for clarity.

  3. I am not sure how to handle missing values.

  4. Yes, the node size should vary based on the number of connections to highlight
  key influencers.

  5. I do not know, but the labels should be clear and readable.

  6. I am not sure, but it should reflect the collaboration strength effectively.

  7. I do not have a preference for node shapes.

  8. I do not think I need additional annotations or highlights.

  9. I have no specific preferences regarding the overall style and aesthetics.'
