initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the Company Collaboration Network dataset,
  showcasing different business groups, their connections, and the weights of these
  connections. Use text annotations to highlight key nodes and their group affiliations,
  especially those with higher weights or significant connections. Highlight significant
  elements to emphasize main actors and connections within the network. This will
  help in understanding the structure and importance of specific collaborations, aiding
  in identifying influential groups and potential opportunities for strengthening
  business ties. Ensure the visualization distinguishes between 'nodes' and 'edges'
  effectively for better clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between different
  business groups?

  2. Should the size of the rectangles in the Treemap represent the weight of connections
  or another attribute?

  3. Do you want to display any specific labels or annotations for key nodes directly
  on the Treemap?

  4. Is there a specific way you would prefer to distinguish between ''nodes'' and
  ''edges'' in the Treemap?

  5. Should the Treemap include a legend or key to explain the categories and connections?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font size and style used for text annotations?

  7. Are there particular business groups or connections you want to emphasize more
  than others?

  8. Should the highlighted elements (significant nodes and connections) have distinctive
  borders or backgrounds?

  9. Would you like to incorporate any interaction or dynamic aspects, such as zooming
  or hovering effects, or keep it static?

  10. Are there any constraints on the dimensions (height and width) of the Treemap
  for your intended display medium?'
