initial_prompt: I want to create a pie chart using the provided data that shows the
  distribution of different groups within our company collaboration network. Specifically,
  I am interested in emphasizing the Marketing group and comparing its size to other
  groups. Use text annotations to highlight the names of group members and any missing
  values. Make sure to distinguish the Marketing group with a different color to make
  it stand out. This visualization aims to provide a clear overview of the group compositions,
  making it easier to identify how marketing fits within the broader network.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color for the Marketing group to make it stand
  out?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the other groups?

  3. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the text annotations?

  4. How would you prefer the missing values to be indicated or annotated?

  5. Is there a preferred layout or positioning for the group member names annotations
  on the pie chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the legend style and placement in the chart?'
