initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing TV shows available on different
  streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). Use IMDb ratings and
  Rotten Tomatoes scores for show quality metrics. Plot IMDb ratings on the X-axis,
  Rotten Tomatoes scores on the Y-axis, and encoded platform availability on the bubble
  size (bigger bubbles indicate shows available on more platforms). Add a categorical
  color dimension to distinguish between shows available on one versus multiple platforms.
  Label the bubbles with show titles for better identification. This will help viewers
  quickly understand the distribution and quality of TV shows across streaming platforms.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between shows
  available on one versus multiple platforms?

  2. How do you prefer the show titles to be displayed on the bubbles (e.g., font
  size, font type)?

  3. Do you want the axis titles to be included, and if so, any specific preferences
  for their labels?

  4. Would you like any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key
  data points?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size scale of the bubbles to represent platform
  availability?

  6. Should there be a legend to decode the bubble sizes and colors, and if so, do
  you have any preferences for its placement?

  7. Do you want any gridlines or background styling on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific format or way you want the IMDb ratings and Rotten Tomatoes
  scores to be displayed (e.g., percentage, out of 10, etc.)?

  9. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?'

  2. I am not sure about the font size and type for show titles.

  3. Yes, please include axis titles labeled as "IMDb Ratings" for the X-axis and
  "Rotten Tomatoes Scores" for the Y-axis.

  4. I do not know if any specific annotations or notes are needed.

  5. I do not have a preference for the size scale of the bubbles.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to decode the bubble sizes and colors. I do not
  have a preference for its placement.

  7. I am not sure about gridlines or background styling on the chart.
