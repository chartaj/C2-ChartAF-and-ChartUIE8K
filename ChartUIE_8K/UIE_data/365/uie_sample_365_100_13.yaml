initial_prompt: I need a donut chart that shows the distribution of TV shows available
  on different streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+). Use
  the data format provided, focusing on the 'Netflix', 'Hulu', 'Prime Video', and
  'Disney+' columns. The chart should visually represent the proportions of TV shows
  available on each platform. For instance, if a show is available on Netflix and
  not on the others, it should be counted under Netflix. This will help in understanding
  the availability of TV shows across these popular streaming services. Please ensure
  the chart is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. What specific color scheme would you prefer for each streaming platform
  in the chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the order in which the platforms are displayed in
  the chart?

  3. Would you like data labels to be shown inside the donut chart slices or outside?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legends
  in the chart?

  5. Do you want a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Would you like a legend to accompany the chart, and if so, where should it be
  placed?

  7. Should the chart display percentage values, numerical counts, or both for each
  segment?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like us to include
  in the chart?

  9. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would like for the chart?
