initial_prompt: Please create a table chart that visualizes TV shows available on
  Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, and Disney+. Include columns for the show title, year
  of release, age rating, IMDb rating, and Rotten Tomatoes score. Highlight the streaming
  platforms where each show is available using binary indicators (1 for available,
  0 for not available). Ensure the table also shows the count of missing values for
  each rating category (IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes) as well as the unique values in
  the age and year columns. This will help in understanding data distribution and
  platform availability comprehensively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred sorting order for the rows (e.g., by year,
  IMDb rating)?

  2. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for highlighting the availability
  on different streaming platforms?

  3. How would you like the binary indicators for availability (1 for available, 0
  for not available) to be displayed (e.g., checkmarks, colored cells)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific layout for the table, such as alternating row colors
  for better readability?

  5. Is there a particular font or font size you would prefer for the table content?

  6. Would you like the table to include any summary statistics, such as the total
  number of shows available on each platform?

  7. Do you prefer to have the count of missing values shown as a separate row or
  integrated into the column headers?

  8. How would you like the unique values in the age and year columns to be displayed
  (e.g., in a tooltip, at the bottom of the table)?

  9. Are there any specific column widths or alignment preferences you have for the
  table chart?

  10. Do you want any additional descriptive information or footnotes included in
  the table?'
