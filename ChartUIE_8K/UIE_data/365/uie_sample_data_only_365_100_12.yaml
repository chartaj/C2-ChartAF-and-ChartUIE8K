  ratings over the years for TV shows listed in the dataset. The x-axis should be
  the range of years, and the y-axis should display IMDb ratings. Each point on the
  chart should represent an average IMDb rating for all TV shows released in that
  year. Additionally, incorporate a line for Rotten Tomatoes ratings to compare trends
  between IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes scores across different years. This comparison
  will help identify any significant fluctuations in TV show ratings over time.
