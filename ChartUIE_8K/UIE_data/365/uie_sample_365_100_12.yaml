initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the distribution of IMDb ratings
  over the years for TV shows listed in the dataset. The x-axis should be the range
  of years, and the y-axis should display IMDb ratings. Each point on the chart should
  represent an average IMDb rating for all TV shows released in that year. Additionally,
  incorporate a line for Rotten Tomatoes ratings to compare trends between IMDb and
  Rotten Tomatoes scores across different years. This comparison will help identify
  any significant fluctuations in TV show ratings over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data point markers on the lines?

  3. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for either the IMDb
  or Rotten Tomatoes ratings?

  4. Should there be grid lines in the background to help with readability?

  5. Would you like to include annotations for significant peaks or troughs in the
  data?

  6. Do you have a specific title and labels for the axes in mind?

  7. Should the legend be displayed in a particular location on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific highlights or emphasis you would like on certain years
  or ratings?

  9. Would you like the chart to indicate the overall trend line for each rating source?'
