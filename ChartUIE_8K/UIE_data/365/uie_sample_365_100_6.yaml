initial_prompt: I want to visualize the availability of TV shows across different
  streaming platforms. Create a column chart where the x-axis represents the streaming
  platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+) and the y-axis shows the count of
  TV shows available on each platform. Make sure to label the chart properly and use
  different colors for each column to distinguish between the platforms clearly. Additionally,
  include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which streaming platform.
  This will help quickly identify which platform has the most extensive library of
  TV shows.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the columns representing each
  streaming platform?

  2. Is there a specific order in which you would like the streaming platforms to
  be displayed on the x-axis?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have grid lines, both horizontally and vertically,
  for better readability?

  5. Would you like to include the actual count values on top of each column for quick
  reference?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the chart, or should it be labeled as ''Availability
  of TV Shows Across Streaming Platforms''?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or additional information to be highlighted
  on the chart?

  8. Is there a particular background color or style that you would like for the chart''s
  visual appearance?'
