initial_prompt: I want a line chart comparing the number of unique values for different
  columns in the Friends TV show script dataset. Plot the columns 'text', 'speaker',
  'season', 'episode', 'scene', and 'utterance' on the x-axis, and the number of unique
  values on the y-axis. This will help me quickly understand the variety and spread
  of the data across these different attributes of the show. Make sure the chart is
  clear and properly labeled, with a title that mentions it's based on the Friends
  TV show dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to include data markers for each unique value point?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels be rotated or arranged in a particular way?

  5. Do you need grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be shown on both axes
  or just one?

  6. Is there a specific line style you prefer (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  7. Do you want to highlight or annotate any specific points or lines on the chart?

  8. Would you like a legend included on the chart?

  9. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the chart?'
