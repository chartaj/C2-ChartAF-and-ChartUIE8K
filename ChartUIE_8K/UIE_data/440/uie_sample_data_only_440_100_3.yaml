02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the frequency of unique speakers across
  different scenes and episodes in the TV show "Friends" based on the given dataset.
  The heatmap should have scenes on the y-axis and episodes on the x-axis, with each
  cell color representing the count of dialogues by each speaker. Use a color gradient
  to easily distinguish between low and high frequencies. Ensure that missing speaker
  values are accounted for appropriately. This will help identify patterns in character
  appearances and dialogue distribution throughout the seasons.
