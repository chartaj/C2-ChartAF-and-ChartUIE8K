initial_prompt: Create a candlestick chart visualizing Meta company's stock data with
  specific text annotations highlighting data points from key dates, such as the opening
  and closing prices. Utilize highlights to emphasize significant changes in stock
  prices by altering the color of important candlesticks. The purpose is to offer
  a clear, visual trend of the company's stock performance over time, help in quick
  comparison, and draw attention to potentially impactful trading days. This chart
  aids in business analysis and strategic decision-making. Text annotations should
  also include notes for context where relevant, enhancing overall understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the candlestick chart and
  highlights for significant changes?

  2. Should the annotations be displayed at specific positions on the chart (e.g.,
  above the candlesticks, in a side panel)?

  3. Are there any specific date ranges or key dates you want to ensure are annotated
  on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include any additional visual elements such as trend lines
  or moving averages?

  6. How detailed should the context notes be for the text annotations (e.g., brief
  tooltip vs. detailed description)?

  7. Are there any particular thresholds or criteria for categorizing "significant
  changes" in stock prices that should be highlighted?

  8. Do you want to include volume information on the same chart, perhaps as a secondary
  axis?'
