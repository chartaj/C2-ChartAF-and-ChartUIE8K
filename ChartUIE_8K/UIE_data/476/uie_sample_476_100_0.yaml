initial_prompt: Please create an area chart visualizing cigarette consumption in different
  countries over the years. Highlight the trends specifically for France and the United
  States, as these have unique patterns. Add text annotations for the years with significant
  increases or decreases in consumption for these countries. Display missing data
  points and make them visually distinct. Clearly label each country and chart element
  to help interpret the social-science implications of cigarette consumption trends.
  This will help analyze and compare changes across different countries effectively.
