initial_prompt: I need a Parallel Coordinates chart based on the attached supply chain
  data. This chart should show relationships between different attributes like 'Product
  type,' 'Price,' 'Availability,' 'Number of products sold,' 'Revenue generated,'
  'Customer demographics,' 'Stock levels,' 'Lead times,' 'Order quantities,' 'Shipping
  times,' 'Shipping costs,' 'Supplier name,' 'Defect rates,' and 'Transportation modes.'
  This will help in visualizing how different aspects of our supply chain process
  are correlated, aiding in identifying patterns, potential bottlenecks, and opportunities
  for optimization within the business context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred order for the attributes on the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  2. Are there any specific color schemes you would like to use for different attributes
  or categories?

  3. Would you like to differentiate the lines based on any particular attribute,
  such as ''Product type'' or ''Supplier name''?

  4. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you want to highlight for certain
  attributes?

  5. Do you prefer to include labels for the axes or any other annotations on the
  chart?

  6. Would you like to incorporate any filtering options to allow focusing on specific
  data sets (e.g., by ''Product type'' or ''Transportation modes'')?

  7. Do you want to display any summary statistics or average lines on the chart for
  better context?

  8. Are there any specific interactions or hover-over details you prefer for additional
  insights on data points?'
