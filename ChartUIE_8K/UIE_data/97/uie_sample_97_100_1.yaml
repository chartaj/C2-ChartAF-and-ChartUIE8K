initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showcasing the relationship between Product
  Price and Revenue Generated, highlighting specific data points with text annotations
  for SKU, Shipping Costs, and Defect Rates. Utilize highlights to distinguish between
  different Product Types (e.g., haircare and skincare) using varying colors or sizes
  to emphasize differences. This visualization will help in supply chain analysis
  by providing clear insights into how pricing strategies impact revenue, identifying
  key suppliers and understanding the correlation with shipping costs and defect rates
  for business decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for distinguishing between different
  Product Types?

  2. Should the text annotations for SKU, Shipping Costs, and Defect Rates be displayed
  for all data points or only for specific ones?

  3. Do you prefer varying sizes or varying colors to emphasize differences between
  Product Types?

  4. Would you like a legend to explain the colors or sizes used for different Product
  Types?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. How would you like the axes to be labeled or formatted?

  7. Are there any specific threshold values for Shipping Costs and Defect Rates that
  you would like to highlight?

  8. Do you want gridlines or any specific background patterns in the scatter plot
  to aid in analysis?

  9. Should the scatter plot include any trend lines or regression lines to show the
  correlation more explicitly?

  10. Are there any company branding guidelines or color schemes that should be followed
  in the visualization?'
