initial_prompt: Create a box chart displaying the distribution of Prices, Shipping
  Costs, and Manufacturing Costs for different Product types. Highlight the median,
  quartiles, and any potential outliers. This will help us understand the cost variability
  and identify any cost anomalies across the supply chain.

  2. Would you like each Product type to have distinct colors?

  4. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted or marked (e.g., different
  color, shape)?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like on the chart (e.g.,
  specific quartile values or outlier explanations)?

  6. Do you want gridlines displayed on the chart for easier reading of values?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, how do you want it formatted?

  9. Do you prefer any particular type of box plot (e.g., traditional, notched)?

  10. Would you like to include additional statistical markers, such as mean values,
  on the chart?'
