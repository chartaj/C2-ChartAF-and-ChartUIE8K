initial_prompt: I want a heatmap to analyze the correlation between various variables
  in the supply chain data. Specifically, focus on metrics like Price, Availability,
  Number of products sold, Revenue generated, Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities,
  Shipping times, Shipping costs, Manufacturing costs, and Defect rates. The heatmap
  should highlight the strengths of these correlations to identify any significant
  relationships. This visualization will help us understand which factors are most
  closely related and could impact our business performance. Please ensure the heatmap
  includes appropriate labels and color coding for clear interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  2. Are there particular color scales (e.g., diverging, sequential) you want to use
  to represent the correlations?

  3. Would you prefer the color intensity to reflect the strength of correlations
  directly, or should there be specific highlights for strong positive or negative
  correlations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of values displayed for the correlation
  coefficients (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  5. Should the heatmap include exact numerical correlation values on the cells, or
  do you prefer to rely solely on color intensity?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations on the heatmap, such as star indicators
  for statistically significant correlations?

  7. Do you prefer hierarchical clustering or any specific arrangement for the variables
  in the heatmap to better illustrate their relationships?

  8. How would you like the labels to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  9. Should the heatmap have a title or any supplementary text for explanatory purposes?

  10. Are there specific gridlines or borders you want to include in the heatmap for
  better separation of cells?

  11. Would you like to see any additional summary statistics or legends on the heatmap
  for better interpretation?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  2. I am not sure about the color scales.

  3. I would prefer the color intensity to reflect the strength of correlations directly.

  4. I prefer the range of values displayed for the correlation coefficients to be
  -1 to 1.

  5. I would prefer to include exact numerical correlation values on the cells.

  6. I am not sure about annotations; maybe star indicators could be useful.

  7. I do not know about hierarchical clustering; use a layout that best illustrates
  relationships.

  8. I have no specific preference for label format.

  9. Yes, please include a title and any necessary explanatory text.

  10. I have no specific preference regarding gridlines or borders.

  11. A legend would be useful for better interpretation.'
