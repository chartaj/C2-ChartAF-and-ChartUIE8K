initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the supply chain performance. Specifically,
  plot the "Lead times," "Manufacturing lead time," and "Shipping times" for various
  "Product types" across different "Suppliers." Use data from the provided file to
  show trends over time or changes based on product type and supplier. This will help
  in identifying any bottlenecks or delays in the supply chain process. Ensure the
  x-axis represents the time or product types, and the y-axis plots the lead times.
  Different colors or markers should represent different lead times to aid clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different lead times?

  2. Should the x-axis represent time, product types, or both?

  3. Do you prefer solid or dashed lines for different lead times?

  4. Do you want any specific markers for different data points (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  5. How many different suppliers are represented in your data, and do you want to
  color-code them as well?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should any specific time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) be used on the x-axis
  if time is selected?

  8. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include in the chart?

  9. Do you want any annotations or comments on specific data points that show noticeable
  trends or outliers?

  10. Is there a particular font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  legends?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. The x-axis should represent both time and product types.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not know the number of suppliers, but color-coding them would be helpful.

  6. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Yes, annotations on specific data points that show noticeable trends or outliers
  would be useful.

  10. I do not know.'
