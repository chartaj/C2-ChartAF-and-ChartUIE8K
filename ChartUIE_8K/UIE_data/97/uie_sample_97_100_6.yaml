initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing the distribution of
  suppliers and their respective locations. Use the Supplier name and Location data
  columns to show where each supplier is situated globally. Also, highlight the stock
  levels at each location. The heatmap should indicate regions with higher stock levels
  using a gradient color scheme. This will help us identify key geographical areas
  contributing to our supply chain's inventory. Make sure the map is interactive so
  we can zoom in on specific regions for a detailed overview of supplier distribution
  and stock availability. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the gradient representing\
  \ stock levels? \n2. How would you like to categorize the different stock levels\
  \ (e.g., low, medium, high)?\n3. Would you prefer specific labels or tooltips to\
  \ display more detailed information when hovering over a region?\n4. Are there any\
  \ specific geographic boundaries (e.g., countries, continents) that you want to\
  \ emphasize or exclude?\n5. Do you have a preferred map projection (e.g., Mercator,\
  \ Robinson)?\n6. Is there a specific base map style you prefer (e.g., satellite,\
  \ terrain, streets)?\n7. Would you like any additional markers or annotations on\
  \ the map to highlight regions of special interest?\n8. Do you have a preferred\
  \ font style and size for any text or labels on the map?\n9. Should the map include\
  \ a legend to explain the color gradient and stock level categories?"
