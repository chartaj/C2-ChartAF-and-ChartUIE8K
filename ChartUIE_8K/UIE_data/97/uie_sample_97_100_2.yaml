initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the data, specifically focusing
  on 'Product type' and 'Revenue generated'. Annotate key data points in the chart
  to highlight significant revenues among different product types like 'haircare'
  and 'skincare'. Employ highlights to distinguish between different shipping carriers
  and their respective costs. The chart aims to provide insights into the relationship
  between product types, their revenue, and the associated shipping costs and carriers.
  This will help identify profitable product categories and efficient shipping methods.
  Ensure it is visually appealing and easy to interpret for stakeholders analyzing
  supply chain efficiency.
