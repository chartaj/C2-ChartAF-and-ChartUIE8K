initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing global literacy rates from
  the dataset. Annotate regions with extreme literacy values to highlight disparities.
  Utilize color gradients for population density and add tooltips for population,
  GDP, and phone lines per 1000. This will emphasize socioeconomic contrasts and help
  interpret the data more comprehensively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap and population
  density gradients?

  2. Would you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  3. How would you like the extreme literacy values to be annotated (e.g., highlighted
  regions, labels, different icons)?

  4. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for literacy rates that you consider
  "extreme" and should be highlighted?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations and tooltips?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or scales to explain the color gradients?

  7. Are there any additional data attributes or details you would like to include
  in the tooltips besides population, GDP, and phone lines per 1000?

  8. Is there a specific layout or arrangement you prefer for the map elements (e.g.,
  legend position, tooltip placement)?

  9. Would you like to include borders or markers for countries/regions to enhance
  geographic context?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of the geographic
  heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Highlighted regions with labels would be good.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, including borders for countries/regions would be helpful.

  10. I do not know.'
