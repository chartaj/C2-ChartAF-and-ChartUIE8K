initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing the GDP ($ per capita)
  of different countries from the provided dataset. Annotate the countries with the
  highest and lowest GDPs to draw attention to these outliers. Use color gradients
  to represent the GDP values, making it easy to compare regions visually. Highlight
  the regions such as ASIA, EASTERN EUROPE, and NORTHERN AFRICA based on their economic
  status. This visualization will help in understanding the economic distribution
  globally and identify regions with significant economic disparities. Ensure that
  the map is clear and readable to support analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used to
  represent the GDP values?

  2. Are there particular color schemes you would prefer for highlighting ASIA, EASTERN
  EUROPE, and NORTHERN AFRICA?

  3. Do you want specific annotations or icons to be used for the countries with the
  highest and lowest GDPs?

  4. Is there a preferred map projection you would like to use for the geographic
  heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the country names
  and annotations?

  6. Would you like additional legends or labels to be included to enhance readability
  and interpretation?

  7. Are there any specific data labels (e.g., GDP values) you want displayed on the
  map for each country?

  8. Do you require a border or additional styling for the highlighted regions?

  9. Is there a particular order or emphasis you want for the highlighted regions
  based on their economic status?

  10. Do you prefer to have a title and subtitle on the map? If yes, please specify
  the preferred text.'
