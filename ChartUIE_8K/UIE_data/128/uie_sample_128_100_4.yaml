initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart visualizing GDP ($ per capita) trends
  across three countries: Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria. Use the population data
  as the x-axis to show how GDP per capita changes relative to population size. Include
  labels for each country, and ensure that the different lines are color-coded for
  clarity. Additionally, highlight any points where data might be missing, as indicated
  in the dataset summary. This visualization will help understand the economic context
  within these regions. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Are there specific line styles you would like for each country (e.g., solid,
  dashed, dotted)?

  3. How would you like the missing data points to be highlighted (e.g., with markers,
  different colors, annotations)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style and size for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the x-axis (population) and y-axis (GDP per capita) have specific scales
  (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include in the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the placement or styling of the legend?

  9. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart for
  better context?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the line styles; any standard differentiation will work.

  3. Missing data points could be highlighted with markers, please.

  4. I have no specific preference for the font style and size.

  5. Linear scales for both x-axis and y-axis will be fine.

  6. Yes, including grid lines for better readability would be helpful.

  7. A title like "GDP per Capita Trends Relative to Population Size" and a subtitle
  mentioning the countries (Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria) would be great.

  8. I am not sure about the placement or styling of the legend.

  9. I do not know if any additional annotations or notes are needed.


  Thank you!'
