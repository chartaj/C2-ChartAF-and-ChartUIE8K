09_answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the line styles; any standard differentiation will work.

  3. Missing data points could be highlighted with markers, please.

  4. I have no specific preference for the font style and size.

  5. Linear scales for both x-axis and y-axis will be fine.

  6. Yes, including grid lines for better readability would be helpful.

  7. A title like "GDP per Capita Trends Relative to Population Size" and a subtitle
  mentioning the countries (Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria) would be great.

  8. I am not sure about the placement or styling of the legend.

  9. I do not know if any additional annotations or notes are needed.
