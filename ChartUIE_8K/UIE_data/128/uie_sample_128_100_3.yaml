initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the literacy rates and GDP per capita
  across various countries and regions. Include data on population density, coastline
  ratio, and infant mortality rate as additional dimensions of interest. Highlight
  differences between regions to showcase disparities. Use color gradients to easily
  distinguish between high and low values across these metrics. Ensure the heatmap
  offers interactive elements to filter by region and population size for deeper insights.
  This visualization will help in understanding socio-economic conditions worldwide.
  Refer to the "Countries of the World" dataset for comprehensive data on social and
  economic indicators.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient used to distinguish
  between high and low values?

  2. Should any specific regions or countries be emphasized in the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer a particular layout or grouping for the regions displayed in the
  heatmap?

  4. Are there specific thresholds or categories for population density, coastline
  ratio, or infant mortality rate that should be highlighted?

  5. Would you like to include any particular annotations or labels for extreme values
  or notable data points?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the countries or regions to be displayed
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you have preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  8. Are there any particular colorblind-friendly palettes you would like us to consider?

  9. Should the heatmap include a legend or key with detailed explanations of the
  color gradients?'
