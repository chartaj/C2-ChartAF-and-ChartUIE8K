initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot using the "Countries of the World"
  dataset. Specifically, I'd like to plot GDP ($ per capita) on the x-axis and Infant
  mortality (per 1000 births) on the y-axis. Each point should represent a country,
  and I'd like the color of the points to indicate the Region. The size of each point
  should correspond to the Population of the country. Please ensure the axes are labeled
  effectively for clarity and include a legend to identify the different regions.
  This visualization will help me analyze the relationship between a country's wealth
  and its infant mortality rate.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for indicating different
  regions on the scatter plot?

  2. What range should the axes cover for GDP ($ per capita) and Infant mortality
  (per 1000 births)?

  3. Do you prefer logarithmic scaling for any of the axes to better visualize the
  data with wide ranges?

  4. Would you like grid lines in your scatter plot for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axes labels and
  legend?

  6. Should the region labels in the legend be ordered in a specific way?

  7. Is there a specific format or style for the size of the points to represent population
  that you prefer (e.g., proportional scaling)?

  8. Are there any specific points (countries) you would like to highlight or annotate
  in the scatter plot?

  9. Do you have any preference for the thickness of the point borders in the scatter
  plot?

  10. Should the chart include any additional textual information or insights, such
  as key patterns or trends identified?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines for better readability.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Proportional scaling for the size of the points to represent population sounds
  good.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. I do not know.'
