initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing the profiles of Indian candidates
  for the General Election 2019. The parameters to include are AGE, CRIMINAL CASES,
  GENERAL VOTES, POSTAL VOTES, ASSETS, and LIABILITIES. Each axis should represent
  one of these categories, and the chart should compare the profiles of multiple candidates
  within the same constituency. Ensure the radar chart highlights the distinctions
  among candidates from different parties to reflect any variations. This will help
  in understanding the diverse backgrounds and standings of the candidates in a visually
  intuitive manner.

  4. Do you want gridlines on the radar chart for easier comparison?

  5. Is there a particular order you want the parameters (AGE, CRIMINAL CASES, GENERAL
  VOTES, POSTAL VOTES, ASSETS, LIABILITIES) to be arranged on the axes?

  6. Do you require any specific annotations or highlights for certain candidates
  or data points?

  7. Should each axis have the same scale, or would you prefer customized scales for
  each parameter?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the thickness or style of the lines representing
  each candidate?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please
