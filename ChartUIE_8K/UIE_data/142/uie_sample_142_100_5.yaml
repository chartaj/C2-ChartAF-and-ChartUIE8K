initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of candidate ages
  across different states for the Indian Candidates in the General Election 2019.
  Use the 'AGE' column for the data points and group the candidates by the 'STATE'
  column. This will help in understanding the age range of candidates who participated
  in different states. Please label the x-axis as "State" and the y-axis as "Age".
  Include appropriate titles and legends for clarity. Make sure to highlight any outliers
  in the dataset as well.

  2. Would you like to display the mean age on the box chart?

  3. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  4. Should the states be sorted in any particular order, such as alphabetical or
  by median age?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for labels and titles?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  7. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., specific color, shape)?

  8. Is there any additional information or annotations you would like to include
  on the chart?

  9. Do you have any preference on the aspect ratio or dimensions of the chart?
