initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the total votes received by
  each candidate in the ADILABAD constituency in the 2019 Indian General Elections.
  Use `NAME` for the x-axis and stack the `GENERAL VOTES` and `POSTAL VOTES` for each
  candidate on the y-axis. Ensure the chart distinguishes between `GENERAL VOTES`
  and `POSTAL VOTES` using different colors. Include a legend to identify these. Use
  labels on the bars to show exact vote counts. Ensure the chart is clearly titled,
  and axes are labeled appropriately for clarity. This will help compare the vote
  contribution from different voting methods for each candidate.
