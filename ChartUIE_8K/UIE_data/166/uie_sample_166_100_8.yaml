initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the Disease Symptoms and Patient
  Profile Dataset. The chart should display the frequency of different symptoms (Fever,
  Cough, Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing) across various diseases. Each bar should represent
  a disease, and the segments within the bars should indicate the presence or absence
  of each symptom. This will help to easily compare how symptoms vary across different
  diseases. Additionally, please color code the segments to distinguish between symptoms
  for better visual clarity. Ensure labels and a legend are included for interpretation.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the segments representing
  each symptom?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the labels and legend?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the diseases to be displayed in the bar chart?

  4. Would you like any specific titles or annotations included in the chart to enhance
  clarity?

  5. How would you like to handle cases where symptoms are absent (e.g., specific
  color or shading)?

  6. Do you want the chart to display exact frequency counts or just the presence/absence
  of symptoms?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the font size and style.

  3. I do not know the preferred order for the diseases.

  4. Please include a title like "Symptom Frequency Across Diseases" and labels for
  the x-axis and y-axis.

  5. I do not know how to handle the absence of symptoms.

  6. Just show the presence/absence of symptoms rather than frequency counts.'
