  \ trend lines, are calculated from the underlying data.\n\n3. Highlights:\nDescription:\
  \ Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color) to emphasize\
  \ or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain elements from\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Stacked bar/column chart that utilizes the data
  format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Stacked bar/column
  chart that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the Disease Symptoms and Patient Profile
  Dataset. The chart should display the frequency of different symptoms (Fever, Cough,
  Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing) across various diseases. Each bar should represent
  a disease, and the segments within the bars should indicate the presence or absence
  of each symptom. This will help to easily compare how symptoms vary across different
  diseases. Additionally, please color code the segments to distinguish between symptoms
  for better visual clarity. Ensure labels and a legend are included for interpretation.
  Thank you!
