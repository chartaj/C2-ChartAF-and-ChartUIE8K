initial_prompt: I'd like to have a heatmap visualization of the Disease Symptoms and
  Patient Profile Dataset. Specifically, I want to see the correlation between different
  symptoms like Fever, Cough, Fatigue, and Difficulty Breathing against age and gender.
  It would be helpful if the heatmap could showcase how these variables interact with
  the "Outcome Variable" to identify any noticeable patterns about how these factors
  impact health outcomes. Please include age in bins or ranges for better clarity,
  and differentiate male and female data points within the heatmap for more detailed
  analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Do you want a specific range for binning the ages (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.)?

  3. How would you like the differentiation between male and female data points to
  be represented (e.g., separate heatmaps, different colors within the same heatmap)?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included for better clarity?

  5. Is there a particular way you prefer the "Outcome Variable" to be showcased in
  the heatmap (e.g., as a separate axis, color gradient)?

  6. Do you have a specific favorite or preferred font style and size for the text
  in the heatmap?

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Binning the ages in ranges of 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, etc., would be good.

  3. Different colors within the same heatmap would be preferable.

  4. I do not know.

  5. As a color gradient, if possible.

  6. I have no specific preference.
