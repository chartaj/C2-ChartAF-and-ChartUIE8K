initial_prompt: Please provide a table chart that summarizes the Disease Symptoms
  and Patient Profile Dataset. The table should include columns for Disease, Fever,
  Cough, Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing, Age, Gender, Blood Pressure, Cholesterol Level,
  and Outcome Variable. Make sure to highlight any patterns or correlations between
  the symptoms and their outcomes, such as how often specific diseases result in positive
  vs. negative outcomes based on patient profiles like age, gender, and vital signs.
  The goal is to help identify which symptoms are most indicative of serious health
  conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting patterns or correlations
  in the table?

  2. Would you like the table to include summary statistics (e.g., means, medians)
  for quantitative attributes such as ''Age'', ''Blood Pressure'', and ''Cholesterol
  Level''?

  3. Should the table include visual indicators (e.g., icons or color coding) for
  categorical attributes such as ''Fever'', ''Cough'', ''Fatigue'', etc.?

  4. Do you want the results of correlations displayed numerically, graphically, or
  both?

  5. Would you like the table to be sortable by any specific columns?

  6. Is there a particular layout or order of columns you prefer in the table?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size used in the table?

  8. Should the table include any annotations or tooltips to explain highlighted patterns
  or correlations?

  9. Are there any specific diseases or symptoms you would like to focus more on within
  the table?

  10. Would you like to include any filters or slicers to dynamically narrow down
  data by specific attributes such as ''Age'' or ''Gender''?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include summary statistics.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Both would be ideal.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  8. Yes, annotations or tooltips would be beneficial.
