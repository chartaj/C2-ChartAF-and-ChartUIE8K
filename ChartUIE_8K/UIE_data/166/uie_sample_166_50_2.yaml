initial_prompt: Create a box plot to compare 'Age' across different 'Disease' categories.
  Highlight differences in 'Blood Pressure' and 'Cholesterol Level'. Use shapes to
  emphasize key findings where 'Fever' and 'Outcome Variable' show a pattern.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the box plot?\n\
  2. Should different 'Disease' categories be color-coded distinctly?\n3. How would\
  \ you like the 'Blood Pressure' differences to be highlighted (e.g., colored markers,\
  \ additional annotations)?\n4. How would you like the 'Cholesterol Level' differences\
  \ to be highlighted?\n5. What specific shapes do you prefer to emphasize key findings\
  \ related to 'Fever' and 'Outcome Variable'? \n6. Should the key findings related\
  \ to 'Fever' and 'Outcome Variable' be annotated with text labels?\n7. Do you prefer\
  \ any specific shapes or symbols to represent different conditions or patterns?\n\
  8. Would you like grid lines to be visible or hidden in the background of the box\
  \ plot?\n9. Do you prefer the box plot to have a legend for the color coding and\
  \ shapes used?\n10. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., specific age ranges,\
  \ simplified categories)?"
