initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart using the Disease Symptoms and
  Patient Profile Dataset. The chart should display the number of patients experiencing
  each symptom (Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing) grouped by disease type.
  Each group should represent one disease, and each column within the group should
  represent the symptoms for that disease. Label the x-axis with the disease types
  and the y-axis with the number of patients. Also, ensure that you include a legend
  to indicate which color represents which symptom. This visualization will help in
  comparing symptom distribution across different diseases. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each symptom in the
  legend?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to display numbers or percentages on the y-axis?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the order in which the diseases or symptoms are
  displayed?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you''d like for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?'
