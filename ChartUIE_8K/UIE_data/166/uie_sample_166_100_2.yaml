initial_prompt: Please create a box chart that visualizes the distribution of 'Age'
  across different diseases in the health data. Highlight outliers and significant
  trends in age distributions for diseases like 'Influenza' and 'Common Cold.' Use
  shapes to mark the median and interquartile ranges. Emphasize differences in age
  distribution between 'Positive' and 'Negative' outcomes, possibly using different
  colors or sizes. Include annotations to note key differences and interesting patterns
  in the age data. This will help in understanding age-related trends and outcomes
  for different diseases. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like\
  \ to use for the 'Positive' and 'Negative' outcomes?\n2. Are there any specific\
  \ shapes you would prefer to use for marking the median and interquartile ranges?\n\
  3. Would you like any specific style or format for the annotations highlighting\
  \ key differences and interesting patterns?\n4. Do you have a preference for the\
  \ chart's orientation (vertical or horizontal box plots)?\n5. Is there a particular\
  \ font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels and annotations?\n6. Should\
  \ the chart include a legend for clarity, and if so, how would you like it to be\
  \ positioned?\n7. Would you like grid lines included in the chart, and if so, at\
  \ what intervals? \n8. Are there any specific diseases, other than 'Influenza' and\
  \ 'Common Cold,' that you want to focus on or include in the visualization?\n9.\
  \ Do you have a preference for the chart's background color or style (plain, gradient,\
  \ etc.)?\n10. Would you need any specific information included in the tooltip when\
  \ hovering over the data points?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I am not sure about the style, but the annotations should clearly highlight key
  differences and interesting patterns.

  4. Vertical box plots would be preferred.

  5. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  6. Yes, a legend would be useful. Please position it at the bottom.

  7. I am not sure about the intervals, but grid lines should be included.

  8. I have no specific preference for additional diseases.

  9. A plain background color will be fine.

  10. I do not need specific information in the tooltip.'
