initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize voter demographics data using a heatmap. Specifically,
  I want to see how different age groups (categorized as 18-29, 30-49, and 50-64)
  voted for Clinton and Trump. The heatmap should clearly display the distribution
  of votes across these age groups for both Clinton and Trump. Please ensure that
  the columns 'Vote for Clinton', 'Vote for Trump', and 'category' are represented
  in the heatmap. This will help in easily identifying which age category leaned more
  towards each candidate. Overall, the heatmap should provide a clear visual comparison
  of voting patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the data values to be represented on the heatmap (e.g., actual
  numbers, percentages)?

  3. Should the heatmap show a legend or color scale to indicate vote distribution
  intensity?

  4. Do you want any specific labels or titles on the chart?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap for clearer distinction
  between categories?

  6. Should there be a tooltip or annotation option when hovering over the heatmap
  cells for additional information?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font type or size for the text labels and titles?

  8. Are there any specific margins or spacing preferences for the heatmap layout?
