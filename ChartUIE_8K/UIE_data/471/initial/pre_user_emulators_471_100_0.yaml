2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a table chart for voter demographics based on age groups, showing the votes
  for Clinton and Trump. Highlight the age groups with the highest and lowest votes
  for each candidate, and annotate the exact vote counts for these groups. This will
  help quickly identify key voting trends. Use both data-driven text annotations for
  the vote counts and visual highlights to distinguish these crucial elements. This
  visual should convey clear and insightful analytics for understanding voting behavior
  across different age demographics.
