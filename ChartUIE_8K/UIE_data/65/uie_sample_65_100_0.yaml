initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the impact of product positioning on
  sales. Use the data provided, including product position, price, promotion, foot
  traffic, and seasonal factors. Highlight high sales volume areas and annotate key
  points such as the top-selling product positions. Emphasize differences in sales
  based on product category and consumer demographics. This visualization should help
  us understand the best strategies for product placement in retail environments and
  identify which factors contribute most to high sales volumes.
