initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the impact of product positioning
  on sales volume. Use 'Product Position' as the x-axis and stack segments by 'Seasonal'
  promotions and 'Foot Traffic' levels. Display sales volume for categories 'Clothing',
  'Electronics', and others. The y-axis will represent 'Sales Volume'. Highlight differences
  in sales between 'Aisle', 'End-cap', and 'Checkout' positions, factoring in whether
  the product is on promotion or not. Ensure each stack is color-coded based on the
  'Foot Traffic' levels to easily compare their influence on sales. Include a legend
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to represent
  different ''Foot Traffic'' levels in the stacked columns?

  2. Would you like the sales volume for each ''Product Category'' to be represented
  with different shades or patterns within the stacks?

  3. Should the chart include data labels showing exact sales volumes on the stacks?

  4. Is there a preferred order for displaying the ''Product Positions'' on the x-axis
  (e.g., Aisle, End-cap, Checkout)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend on the chart?

  6. Would you like specific annotations or callouts for certain data points, such
  as highest or lowest sales volumes?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability of the y-axis values?

  8. Are there any additional details or footnotes you would like to be included on
  the chart for context?'
