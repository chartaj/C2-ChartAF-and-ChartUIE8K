initial_prompt: I need a pie chart that shows the distribution of the different 'Product
  Categories' from the given data. This visualization will help us understand the
  share of each category in terms of sales across the board. Itâ€™s essential for assessing
  how product placement correlates with sales volume. Please represent the product
  categories like 'Clothing', 'Electronics', etc., in the pie chart, highlighting
  the proportion of each category in our merchandise. This will give insight into
  which product categories dominate and which ones lag behind in sales performance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or a color palette you would
  like to use for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the slice labels to show category names, sales volumes, or both?

  3. Do you prefer the percentages to be displayed on the slices or in a legend?

  4. Should the pie chart include a title? If yes, what should the title be?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style or size for labels and title?

  6. Would you like to emphasize certain categories by using different shades or patterns?

  7. Should the pie chart include any annotations or additional information?

  8. Do you have a preferred order for the slices (e.g., descending order, alphabetical
  order, etc.)?

  9. Would you like to include a legend? If yes, where should it be positioned (e.g.,
  right, bottom, top)?'
