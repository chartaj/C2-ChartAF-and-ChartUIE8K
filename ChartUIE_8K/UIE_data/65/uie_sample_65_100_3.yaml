initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart that visualizes the impact of product positioning
  on sales volume. Specifically, I'd like to compare the sales volumes of products
  placed in different positions (aisle, end-cap, and checkout). Each group should
  represent a different product position, and the bars within each group should display
  the average sales volume for products in that position. Ensure you highlight how
  foot traffic (low, medium, high) and promotion (yes, no) might correlate with these
  sales numbers. This will help understand which positioning strategy maximizes sales
  in varying circumstances. Please make it clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different product positions,
  foot traffic levels, or promotion statuses?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for easier reading of the values?

  3. Do you have a specific order in which you want the product positions to be displayed
  (e.g., Aisle, End-cap, Checkout)?

  4. Should the bars within each group be displayed side by side or stacked?

  5. Do you want data labels showing exact values on top of each bar?

  6. Are there specific axis labels or titles you prefer for the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred font type or size for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to include any trendlines or annotations to emphasize particular
  data points?

  9. Should the legend include information on both foot traffic and promotion, and
  if so, how would you like it structured?

  10. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would prefer for the chart?'
