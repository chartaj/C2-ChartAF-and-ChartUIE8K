initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to analyze the impact of product positioning
  on sales volume. Utilize the provided dataset (65.csv), focusing on how 'Product
  Position' affects 'Sales Volume'. Highlight different box plots for each 'Product
  Category' to visualize variability and trends across various categories. Also, show
  the median and any outliers clearly. This visualization should help us understand
  if certain product positions significantly impact sales and if these effects differ
  between categories like Clothing, Electronics, etc. Make sure to label axes and
  include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the colors of the box plots for
  different product categories?

  2. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal box plots?

  3. Are there any specific labels or descriptions you would like included on the
  axes?

  4. How would you like the outliers to be represented (e.g., as dots, different shapes,
  etc.)?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Would you like the median to be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., bold line,
  different color)?

  7. Are there any specific font preferences or styles for the chart labels and legend?

  8. Do you prefer any particular order for the categories on the x-axis or y-axis?'
