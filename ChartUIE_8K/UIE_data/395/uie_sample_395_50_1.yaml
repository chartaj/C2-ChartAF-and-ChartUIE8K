initial_prompt: Create a dendrogram to visualize dependencies within a software package.
  Use shape annotations to highlight key clusters and modify the appearance of elements
  to emphasize critical nodes with multiple imports. This will help understand interconnected
  components in technology.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting key clusters?

  2. Would you like to use any specific shapes or symbols for annotating the clusters?

  3. Are there any specific colors you prefer for emphasizing critical nodes with
  multiple imports?

  4. Would you prefer a specific arrangement of the dendrogram (e.g., horizontal or
  vertical layout)?

  5. Are there any font preferences for labeling nodes and clusters?

  6. Should we include node size variations based on their import counts or other
  criteria?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the thickness or style of the branches
  in the dendrogram?

  8. Is there a specific level of granularity required for the clusters (e.g., maximum
  number of levels or clusters to display)?

  9. Would you like to display tooltips or labels for nodes when hovering over them?

  10. Do you have any preference for the background color or other stylistic elements
  of the chart?'
