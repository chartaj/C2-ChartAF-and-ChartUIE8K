initial_prompt: Visualize the software package dependencies using a Dendrogram. Highlight
  clusters of interconnected libraries and dependencies. Use shapes like rectangles
  to group related elements and arrows to show dependencies between nodes. Differentiate
  groups by using varying colors and sizes to make important elements stand out. The
  purpose is to understand the structure and relationships of software components
  within the computers-and-technology domain. The visualization should clearly show
  which libraries are most central and which have fewer connections, making software
  development and debugging easier.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for differentiating
  groups?

  2. How would you like the size of elements to be scaled? Should it be based on the
  ''size'' attribute or another criteria?

  3. Any preferred shapes other than rectangles for grouping related elements?

  4. Should there be any specific indication for the most central libraries, such
  as unique colors or shapes?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want to include for nodes or
  clusters?

  6. How detailed would you like the arrows showing dependencies to be? Should they
  show all dependencies or just the primary ones?

  7. Do you prefer a certain orientation for the Dendrogram (horizontal or vertical)?

  8. Are there any particular libraries or dependencies you would like to highlight
  individually?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please use unique colors for the most central libraries.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Just the primary dependencies should be shown.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. I do not know.'
