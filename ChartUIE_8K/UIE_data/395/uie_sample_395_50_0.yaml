initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing 'size' of different clusters in
  'name'. Use colors to highlight clusters with most imports. Include shape annotations
  for top three clusters to emphasize them. Compare their import connections for better
  understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors to use in highlighting
  the clusters with the most imports?

  2. What type of shape annotations would you prefer for emphasizing the top three
  clusters (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  3. Do you have any specific size preferences for the shape annotations?

  4. Should the imports be displayed as a legend or in another format on the chart?

  5. Would you like to see the import connections as lines or arrows connecting the
  bars on the chart?

  6. Is there any specific ordering of the clusters you would prefer (e.g., sorted
  by size, name, number of imports)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles on the chart?'

  2. I am not sure about the type of shape annotations.
