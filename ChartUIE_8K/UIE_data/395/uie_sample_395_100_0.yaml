initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart that shows the number of unique values
  and the number of missing values for each column in the dataset. Use different colors
  for unique and missing values. Add shape annotations like trend lines to highlight
  columns with significant differences. Also, use highlights to emphasize columns
  with the highest and lowest unique values, changing their color to make them stand
  out. Include axis labels and a title to clarify that this chart analyzes software
  package dependencies, aiming to provide clarity on data quality and uniqueness in
  the dataset for "computers-and-technology".
