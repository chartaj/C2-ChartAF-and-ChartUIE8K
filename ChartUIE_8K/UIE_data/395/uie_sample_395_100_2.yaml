initial_prompt: Can you create a treemap from this data? I want to visualize dependencies
  for a software package. Each 'name' should be a block, its 'size' should determine
  block area, and 'imports' should be inside each block showing dependencies. Use
  highlights to emphasize blocks with the most imports. Utilize shape annotations,
  like rectangles or lines, to group related dependencies. Make it clear which blocks
  have higher sizes by using different colors. Include categories as well to show
  relationships and interconnections between dependencies. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating block sizes?

  2. Should larger blocks have a specific color gradient to indicate size differences
  more clearly?

  3. Would you like to use specific shapes for annotations to group related dependencies,
  or are rectangles and lines sufficient?

  4. Do you want to include labels or tooltips on each block to display the exact
  ''size'' values and ''name''?

  5. Are there any specific categories you want to highlight using different shapes
  or colors?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or padding between the blocks on the treemap?

  7. Is there a specific way you''d like the categories to be depicted to show relationships
  and interconnections?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, a specific color gradient would be helpful to indicate size differences
  more clearly.

  3. Rectangles and lines are sufficient.

  4. Yes, please include labels on each block to display the exact ''size'' values
  and ''name''.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.'
