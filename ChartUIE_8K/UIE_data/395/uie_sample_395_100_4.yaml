initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that shows the various software packages along
  with their respective sizes. The x-axis should list the 'name' of each software
  package, and the y-axis should represent their 'size'. Make sure each bar is labeled
  with the corresponding package name. Also, include the number of imports for each
  package at the top of the bars for additional details. Provide a legend that categorizes
  the imports to enhance understanding. The chart should give a clear visual representation
  of the dependencies and size of each software package in an easy-to-understand manner.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the bars and legend
  categories?

  2. Do you want the bars to be displayed in any specific order (e.g., ascending or
  descending by size)?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and numbers
  on the chart?

  4. Would you like any gridlines or background colors to be included in the chart
  for better readability?

  5. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Should the chart have any borders or specific line styles around the bars?

  7. Do you want to include any annotations or notes within the chart to highlight
  specific data points or observations?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratio you would prefer for the chart?

  9. Would you like to add any titles or subtitles to the chart for better context?
  If so, what should they be?'
