initial_prompt: Create a network diagram to visualize the dependencies among software
  packages. Nodes represent packages from the 'name' column, with edges showing 'imports'
  relationships. Sizes of nodes correspond to the 'size' data.
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors or color schemes for the nodes and edges?

  2. Would you like the nodes to be labeled with the package names?

  3. Do you have a preference for the layout style of the network diagram (e.g., force-directed,
  circular, hierarchical)?

  4. Should the edges display any additional information, such as the type of relationship
  or weight?

  5. Do you want the node sizes to be scaled proportionally to their ''size'' attribute
  explicitly, or do you have a preferred scaling factor?

  6. Are there any specific packages or dependencies you would like to highlight or
  emphasize in the diagram?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to include a legend or key explaining the node sizes
  and colors?'
