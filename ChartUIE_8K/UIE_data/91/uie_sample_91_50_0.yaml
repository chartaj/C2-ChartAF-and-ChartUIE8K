initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of dataset sizes (in
  bytes) along with highlights and text annotations for key data points. Emphasize
  datasets with highest sizes and mention missing values in descriptions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the bins of the histogram to be of a specific width or number?

  3. How would you like the key data points to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  bold outline)?

  4. Should the missing values be mentioned in a specific way in the visualization
  (e.g., annotation text, separate note)?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations?

  6. Should the highest sizes be emphasized using a specific method (e.g., color gradient,
  markers)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and title of the histogram?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included in the histogram? If so, do you have a
  preference for its position?

  9. Do you want to include grid lines in the histogram? If so, vertical, horizontal,
  or both?

  10. Are there any additional elements or details you want to see on the histogram?'
