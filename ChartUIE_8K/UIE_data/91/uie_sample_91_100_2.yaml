initial_prompt: Create an area chart that visualizes the trend of views and downloads
  over time for datasets. Highlight the most viewed and downloaded datasets with different
  colors. Use text annotations to display the total upvotes for these highlighted
  datasets to draw attention. The chart should focus on showing the relationship between
  views and downloads to provide insights into dataset popularity. Include context
  about the dataset owner and last updated date in non-data-driven annotations to
  offer additional information. The chart should reflect a snapshot from the most
  recent data update and aim to guide data scientists in identifying popular datasets.

  viewed and downloaded datasets?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines or background shading for better readability?

  7. Do you have a preference for the date format used on the time axis?
