  1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe abbreviated if space is an issue.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, can you please emphasize ''views'' and ''downloads'' more prominently?

  5. No, just the unique value count.

  6. I am not sure, no specific preference.

  7. I do not know. Maybe you could provide a suggestion?
