initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of kernels, discussions,
  views, and downloads for each dataset title. Emphasize the higher values by using
  highlights like different colors or sizes. Add text annotations to indicate specific
  numbers directly on the bars for clarity. This will help identify which datasets
  are more popular and actively discussed. Ensure the chart is clear and each dataset
  title is easily readable. Add a brief description to the chart to explain the metrics
  being compared.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting higher values
  on the bars?

  2. Would you prefer different colors for each metric (kernels, discussions, views,
  downloads) or a single color gradient to show higher values?

  3. Should the bar sizes also vary with the values, or should only colors highlight
  the differences?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations
  on the bars?

  5. Where would you like the text annotations placed on or near the bars (e.g., above,
  inside, or at the end of the bars)?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the dataset titles to ensure
  they are easily readable (horizontal or vertical)?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for the brief description to explain
  the metrics being compared (e.g., positioning at the top or bottom of the chart)?

  8. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like included on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Only colors should highlight the differences.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Above the bars.

  6. Vertical orientation for dataset titles.

  7. Positioning at the top of the chart.

  8. I am not sure.'
