initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of upvotes across
  all datasets. Highlight bins with significantly higher counts. Add annotations for
  the highest and lowest bins to draw attention to outliers and common values. The
  goal is to understand how upvotes vary and identify trends in dataset popularity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How many bins would you like for the histogram?

  3. Do you have a specific range for the x-axis (upvote counts) you would like to
  focus on?

  4. What threshold do you consider for a bin to be significantly higher in counts?

  5. How would you prefer the annotations to be displayed (e.g., arrows, labels, color
  highlights)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and annotations?'
