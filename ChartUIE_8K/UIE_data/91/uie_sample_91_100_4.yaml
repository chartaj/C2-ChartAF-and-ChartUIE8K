initial_prompt: I want a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between various factors
  of Kaggle datasets. Use columns like kernels, discussions, views, downloads, size,
  and upvotes to show how they are interrelated. Highlight the intensity of their
  interactions. This will help in identifying which factors are closely related to
  high engagement and popularity of datasets. The grid should clearly show high correlation
  areas in darker colors. Add labels for clarity. Use the data provided from the CSV
  to create this visual representation for better understanding of dataset dynamics
  on Kaggle.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the intensity of the color gradient to range from a specific color
  to another (e.g., light blue to dark blue)?

  3. How would you like the correlation values displayed on the heatmap (e.g., rounded
  to two decimal places, shown inside the cells)?

  4. Should the heatmap have grid lines separating each cell?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or rotated)?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or highlights for particular correlations
  that are of significant interest?

  8. Do you want a legend included to interpret the color intensities?

  9. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the heatmap to fit
  within a certain space or layout?

  10. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the final visualization
  (e.g., square, rectangular)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Rounded to two decimal places shown inside the cells.

  4. Yes, the heatmap should have grid lines separating each cell.

  5. Horizontal orientation for the labels.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, a legend included to interpret the color intensities would be helpful.

  9. I do not have any specific margins or padding preferences.

  10. No specific preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions.'
