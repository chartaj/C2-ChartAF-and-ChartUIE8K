initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize agricultural value added per
  worker globally from the dataset. Highlight top-producing countries and add annotations
  for specific high and low values. This will help compare productivity across countries
  and identify trends.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing different levels
  of agricultural value added per worker?

  2. Do you prefer any specific countries to be highlighted, or should it be based
  solely on the data?

  3. Should the annotations for specific high and low values include detailed text
  or just numeric values?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the geographic projection used in the choropleth
  map?

  5. Should the color scale be linear or logarithmic to better capture the range of
  the data?

  6. Is there a specific legend format you prefer for the map?

  7. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or reference lines
  on the map?

  8. What is your preferred way to display trends and patterns, such as using gradients
  or thresholds for specific value ranges?

  9. Should the map include labels for all countries or only for those with significant
  values?'
