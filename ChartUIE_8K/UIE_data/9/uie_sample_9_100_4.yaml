initial_prompt: I have a dataset that contains the country, codes, year, and agriculture,
  forestry, and fishing value added per worker in constant 2015 US dollars. I want
  to create a grouped bar chart to visualize this data. Please plot the value added
  per worker for different countries (e.g., Argentina, Armenia, Australia) across
  different years. Each bar group should represent a specific year, and within each
  group, there should be bars for the different countries. Ensure that the data points
  are correctly formatted, especially the numerical values, for accurate representation.
  Provide clear axis labels and a legend for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different countries?

  2. What size and orientation do you prefer for the chart (e.g., landscape or portrait)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should the y-axis be formatted with commas for thousands or any other specific
  format?

  5. Do you want gridlines in the chart for easier comparison, and if so, should they
  be major, minor, or both?

  6. Do you have a preference for the spacing between the grouped bars?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  within each group?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific years or countries with different colors
  or annotations?

  9. Should the chart include a title or subtitle, and if so, what should it be?

  10. Do you prefer the legend to be placed inside the plot area or outside, and on
  which side (top, bottom, left, right)?'
