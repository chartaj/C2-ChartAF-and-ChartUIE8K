  Create a bubble chart visualizing the value added per worker in agriculture, forestry,
  and fishing across different countries. Use the "country" on the x-axis, "Year"
  on the y-axis, and size the bubbles by "Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value
  added per worker (constant 2015 US$)". Each bubble should be colored uniquely by
  "Codes" to distinguish different countries. Include text annotations to highlight
  outliers or trends. This will help visualize agricultural productivity and enable
  a comparative analysis over time.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

  2. Yes, I would like to include a legend.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the format or placement of the text annotations.

  4. I am not sure about the specific range or scale for the bubble sizes.

  5. I do not have any specific preferences for the appearance and format of the x-axis
