initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the trend of value added per worker
  in agriculture, forestry, and fishing sectors (constant 2015 US$) from 1991 onwards
  for several countries. Use the 'country' on the x-axis and 'Agriculture, forestry,
  and fishing, value added per worker (constant 2015 US$)' on the y-axis. Ensure different
  country lines are color-coded for clarity. Label axes adequately and include a legend.
  This chart will help visualize changes in agricultural productivity across countries
  over time. This data is crucial for understanding agricultural and farming developments.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating countries
  on the line chart?

  2. Are there any specific countries you would like to be highlighted or focused
  on?

  3. Would you like to include markers (e.g., dots) on the data points for each year
  along the lines?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for axis labels and the legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed both on the x-axis and y-axis, or on
  one of them?

  6. Should the x-axis display every year, or would you prefer a specific interval
  (e.g., every 5 years)?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or specific notes on the chart?

  9. Are there any additional visual features you would like to include (e.g., title,
  subtitle)?

  10. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the chart?'
