initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart that illustrates the different responses
  to the question "What makes a pizza good?" from the data on Brooklyn pizzerias.
  I want the pie chart segments to represent the unique responses, such as "Toppings,"
  "A lot of cheese," and "Soft dough," with respective percentages. Use text annotations
  to highlight the top three most popular responses. The chart's purpose is to visually
  convey the community preferences regarding pizza quality in Brooklyn, emphasizing
  how common each response is among the participants. Include a descriptive title
  and a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the different
  segments of the pie chart?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations
  highlighting the top three responses?

  3. Do you want any distinction (such as different shades or patterns) for the top
  three most popular responses in the pie chart?

  4. Where would you prefer the legend to be placed on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  5. Is there a specific format or wording you would like for the descriptive title
  of the pie chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart''s overall layout (e.g., circular, exploded
  pie chart)?

  7. Would you like any additional information or context included in the pie chart''s
  annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific colors.

  2. I do not know about the font style or size.

  3. I am not sure how to distinguish the top three responses.

  4. I prefer the legend to be on the right.

  5. I have no specific preference for the title wording.

  6. I prefer a regular circular pie chart.

  7. I do not know about additional information in the annotations.'
