initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the survey responses from
  the dataset about pizza in Brooklyn. Specifically, I would like to see the distribution
  of answers to the question "What makes a pizza good?". Use the categories provided
  (e.g., Toppings, A lot of cheese, Soft dough, etc.) and show the proportion of each
  response in the donut chart. This will help illustrate which factors are most important
  to people in determining the quality of a pizza. Thank you!

  2. Would you like the chart to include percentage values or actual counts on the
  segments?
