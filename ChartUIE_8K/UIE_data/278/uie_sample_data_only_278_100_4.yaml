02_initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for the "Pizza In Brooklyn" dataset. The chart
  should show the different aspects that make a pizza good according to the responses.
  The x-axis should list the different aspects (Toppings, A lot of cheese, Soft dough,
  etc.), and the y-axis should represent the number of responses for each aspect.
  Make sure to differentiate between each aspect using different colors. The chart
  should help to understand what people in Brooklyn think makes a pizza good.
