  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Create a line chart that visualizes the importance of pizza in Brooklyn life over
  time based on the "timestamp" column. Highlight the role pizza plays in Brooklyn
  and whether having a pizzeria nearby makes people feel safer. Use text annotations
  to display key data points for "What makes a pizza good?" and emphasize responses
  to safety-related questions. This will help us understand the community''s sentiment
  about pizzerias.
