- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Geographic heatmap that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Geographic heatmap
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a geographic heatmap highlighting the presence and influence of pizzerias
  in Brooklyn based on the given survey data. Visualize the data showing areas where
  pizzerias make residents feel safer and foster a better community vibe. Include
  layers to indicate safety feelings, community sentiment, and frequency of pizzeria
  visits. Ensure the map is interactive, allowing for zooming into specific neighborhoods.
  Use color gradients to depict varying levels of agreement and positive feelings.
  Include markers for unique survey responses such as what makes a pizza good and
  any specific comments on the role of pizza in Brooklyn life.
