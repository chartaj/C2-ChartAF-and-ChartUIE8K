initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize transistor count distribution across
  different processors from the dataset, highlighting rare and common counts. Use
  text annotations to indicate specific processors with maximum and minimum transistor
  counts. This will help compare technological advancements over time. Ensure the
  x-axis represents transistor counts in bins and the y-axis shows the number of processors.
  Add highlights to significant bins to emphasize industry trends. Include annotations
  for contextual details such as the process technology and designer. This visualization
  aims to convey the evolution of processor designs in computer technology.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How many bins would you like on the x-axis for transistor counts?

  3. Do you have preferences for the font size and style of text annotations?

  4. Should specific processors be highlighted with unique colors or markers?

  5. Is there a preferred placement for the annotations indicating the processors
  with maximum and minimum transistor counts?

  6. Would you prefer a grid background on the histogram for easier reading of values?

  7. Are there specific abbreviations or notations you would like to use for process
  technology and designer annotations?

  8. Should the y-axis (number of processors) use a linear or logarithmic scale?

  9. Do you have preferences for the visual style of the significant bins'' highlights,
  such as shading or outlining?'
