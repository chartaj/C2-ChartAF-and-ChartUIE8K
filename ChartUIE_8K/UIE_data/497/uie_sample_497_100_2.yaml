initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the introduction dates of processors
  against their transistor counts. Highlight processors designed by Intel to emphasize
  their standout contributions. Use text annotations to label key processors, such
  as "Intel 4004" and "Intel 8008," with their introduction dates, transistor counts,
  and process dimensions. This visualization will help trace the evolution of processor
  complexity over time, providing insights into technological advancements in computing.
  Keep the chart clear and informative, focusing on significant data points to understand
  progression trends without overwhelming the viewer.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting Intel processors?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to appear (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Are there any specific milestones or additional processors beyond "Intel 4004"
  and "Intel 8008" that you''d like to highlight?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the trend lines (e.g., solid, dashed, or dotted
  lines)?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for easier reading of data points, and if
  so, vertical, horizontal, or both?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish different designers if highlighting
  Intel processors isn''t enough?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitles you would like to include on the chart?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels have any particular formatting or units described
  explicitly?

  9. Do you have preferences for the chart''s aspect ratio or dimensions for readability?

  10. Is there any specific background style (e.g., white, gradient, or other) you
  prefer for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know any specific milestones beyond "Intel 4004" and "Intel 8008."

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, the chart should include both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. X-axis and y-axis labels should have clear formatting with units explicitly described.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
