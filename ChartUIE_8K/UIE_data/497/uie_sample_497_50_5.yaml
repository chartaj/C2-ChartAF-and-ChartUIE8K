initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the missing values in the processor
  dataset. Use different colors to represent the count of missing values for each
  column, highlighting areas with most missing data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the heatmap for better readability?

  3. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale for missing values?

  4. Is there a specific layout you prefer for the heatmap, such as portrait or landscape
  orientation?

  5. Would you like to annotate the heatmap with the actual count of missing values
  in each cell?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for labels and annotations
  in the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include titles and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  text you would like to use?

  8. Would you like to cluster columns or rows based on the missing values, or display
  them in the order they appear in the dataset?

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to highlight columns with higher missing data more
  prominently?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color scale for missing values.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include titles and axis labels. "Missing Values Heatmap" for the
  title and default labels for the axes is fine.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please highlight columns with higher missing data more prominently.'
