initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between ''transistor_count'',
  ''date_of_introduction'', ''process'', and ''area'' for different processors. Use
  ''designer'' as a categorical axis to distinguish designs by Intel and other designers.
  Highlight missing data points and display them in a contrasting color. Title: "Processor
  Features Comparison Heatmap". Include axis labels, a color bar indicating correlation
  strength, and a legend for missing values. Additionally, it''s essential to clearly
  mark the time progression on the heatmap. The goal is to reveal trends and correlations
  over time and between different processor designs.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like missing data to be represented (e.g., specific color or pattern)?

  3. Should the correlation strength be displayed as numerical values directly on
  the heatmap?

  4. Is there a preferred format or style for the axis labels and title?

  5. Would you like to customize the granularity or interval of the time progression
  marks on the heatmap?

  6. Is there a specific range or limit for correlation values you want to highlight?

  7. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the color bar and legend?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a specific color?

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
