initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of transistor counts for
  different processors. Highlight the bins where key processors like "Intel 4004"
  and "Intel 8008" fall. Annotate these highlighted bins with their respective transistor
  counts to draw attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram and the highlighted
  bins?

  2. How many bins would you like for the histogram distribution?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for the annotations (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Should the histogram include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Do you want a title for the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  6. Should the axes have specific labels or units?

  7. Are there any additional processors aside from "Intel 4004" and "Intel 8008"
  that you would like to highlight?

  8. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend, if needed?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please title it "Transistor Counts Distribution of Various Processors".

  6. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Transistor Counts" and the y-axis should be
  labeled "Number of Processors".

  7. Yes, also highlight the "Intel 8086".

  8. I do not know.'
