initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'transistor_count'
  and 'area' of different processors over the years. Use different colors or markers
  for each processor designer to distinguish them.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for distinguishing different processor
  designers?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the markers used for each processor designer?

  3. Should the size of markers represent any other variable, or remain constant?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to identify the processor designers?

  5. Do you have a preferred title or labels for the x-axis (''transistor_count'')
  and y-axis (''area'')?

  6. Is there a specific range you want to set for the x-axis and y-axis, or should
  it be auto-scaled based on the data?

  7. Do you want to include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Should we annotate specific data points, and if so, based on what criteria?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to identify the processor designers.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know, auto-scaling based on the data should be fine.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
