initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart that visualizes the transistor count and
  process of different processors over time. The x-axis should represent the date
  of introduction, and the y-axis should represent the transistor count and process,
  stacked by designer. Use distinct colors to differentiate between designers. Make
  sure to label the processor names. Some data might be missing, so handle those missing
  values appropriately. The chart should help to compare the advancements in the processors
  designed by different designers over the years. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  between designers?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be handled in the visualization?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style for the labels of processor names (e.g., font
  size, angle, or position)?

  4. Should there be any grid lines or background elements to enhance readability?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing different
  designers?

  6. Are there any specific size dimensions for the chart that you have in mind?

  7. Do you want to include any additional annotations or highlights for significant
  events or milestones in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Handle missing values by leaving gaps or indicating missing data with a neutral
  color.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, include grid lines to enhance readability.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the colors representing different designers.

  6. I do not have any specific size dimensions in mind.

  7. I am not sure.'
