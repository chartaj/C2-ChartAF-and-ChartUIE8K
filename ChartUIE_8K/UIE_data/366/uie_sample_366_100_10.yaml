initial_prompt: I would like to see a scatter plot for the Udemy Courses dataset.
  Please plot the number of subscribers (num_subscribers) on the y-axis and the price
  on the x-axis. Color the points based on the course level (level) to differentiate
  between the different course levels, and please use different marker shapes for
  each subject (subject) to make it easier to distinguish between subjects. This will
  help in understanding the relationship between the course price and the number of
  subscribers, and how this varies across different levels and subjects.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  course levels?

  2. Do you have preferred shapes for the markers to represent different subjects?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to help readers identify the colors and shapes
  used in the scatter plot?

  4. Do you prefer any particular axis scales (linear or logarithmic) for either the
  x-axis or y-axis?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the plot for easier reference?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like for the x-axis, y-axis,
  and the chart itself?

  7. Would you like to see any trend lines or regression lines added to the scatter
  plot to highlight the correlation?'
