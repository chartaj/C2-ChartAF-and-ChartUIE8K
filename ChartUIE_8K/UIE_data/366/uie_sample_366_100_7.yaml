initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart that visualizes Udemy course data. Use
  number of subscribers on the x-axis, number of reviews on the y-axis, and content
  duration as the size of the bubbles. Each bubble should represent a course, and
  different colors should represent the course subjects. I'd like to quickly identify
  trends related to course popularity, engagement, and comprehensiveness. Make sure
  to label the axes and include a legend to identify the subjects. This will help
  understand the effectiveness and reach of different subjects on Udemy. Thanks!

  2. Do you prefer any particular shapes or styles for the bubbles?

  3. Is there a preferred range or scale for the axes?

  4. Do you want any specific labeling format for the axes?
