initial_prompt: Create a dot plot showing the distribution of Udemy courses based
  on the number of subscribers. Use different colors to differentiate levels such
  as 'All Levels', 'Beginner Level', 'Intermediate Level', and 'Expert Level'. Focus
  on the 'num_subscribers' for the x-axis and 'course_title' for the y-axis. Highlight
  whether the course is paid or free by using different shapes for the dots. Also,
  include a legend to clarify the levels and payment status. Please ensure that the
  dots are well-spaced for better readability and interpretation of the data.
