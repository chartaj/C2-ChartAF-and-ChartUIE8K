initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the price distribution of Udemy
  courses across different levels. I want to see the range and median price for each
  course level (All Levels, Intermediate Level, etc.) in the Business Finance subject.
  The data should be taken from the provided dataset. This will help identify pricing
  trends at various course levels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include outliers explicitly?

  3. Should the y-axis (price) be adjusted to a specific range or left to automatically
  scale based on the data?

  4. Do you have any preference for the ordering of the course levels on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical, by median price)?

  5. Would you like to include the exact median price values as labels on the chart?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should we include any annotations or textual descriptions to highlight specific
  trends or findings?

  8. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle for the chart?'
