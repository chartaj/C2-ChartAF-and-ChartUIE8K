initial_prompt: 'Create a flowchart to visualize the process of selecting an appropriate
  Udemy course. Start with the decision point: "Is the course paid?" If "Yes," flow
  to "Course Level" decision point, and then to "Subject," "Price," "Number of Lectures,"
  and finally "Content Duration." For a "No," show courses that are free. Ensure each
  step includes data insights from ../Extra_datas/data/366.csv and reflect details
  about course title, URL, number of subscribers, reviews, and published timestamps.
  This should aid in comparing and selecting the best course efficiently.'

  4. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you would like to be used in the

  5. Do you want each course detail (title, URL, subscribers, reviews, timestamps)
  to be displayed in a specific format or style?

  6. Would you like to include any summary statistics or aggregate information at
  the end of the flowchart?

  7. Should the flowchart be optimized for a specific display size or device (e.g.,
  mobile, desktop)?

  8. Do you need any particular legend or key to be included to explain the symbols

  of design?'
