initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of course prices
  for Udemy courses in the "Udemy Courses" dataset. Highlight the frequency of each
  price point on the x-axis and the number of courses available at those price points
  on the y-axis. This will help visualize how many courses are offered at different
  price levels, and identify any trends in pricing for the courses. We are particularly
  interested in seeing if there are any common price ranges that most courses fall
  into or any price outliers. Keep the chart clear and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. What range of prices do you want to be displayed on the x-axis?

  3. How many bins would you prefer for the histogram?

  4. Should the x-axis be labeled with each individual price point or grouped into
  price ranges?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Would you like any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart labels and
  titles?

  8. Should the histogram include a legend? If so, what information should it convey?

  9. Do you need any annotations or markers for highlighting common price ranges or
  outliers?

  10. Is there a specific chart size or aspect ratio you prefer?'
