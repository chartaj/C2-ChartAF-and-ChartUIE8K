initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationship between the number
  of lectures and the number of subscribers across different course levels in Udemy's
  Business Finance courses. Include colors to indicate the intensity of the number
  of subscribers, with each cell representing a combination of a course level and
  the number of lectures. This will help understand how course structure impacts subscriber
  count. Ensure that all levels—Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, and All Levels—are
  included in the heatmap for a comprehensive analysis of the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap? For example,
  specific colors to represent intensity levels of subscribers.

  2. Should the heatmap include annotations showing the exact number of subscribers
  in each cell?

  3. Are there specific ranges for the number of lectures that you would like highlighted
  or categorized differently within the heatmap?

  4. Do you want a title and axis labels included, and if so, do you have specific
  wording in mind?

  5. Should the color intensity scale be linear or logarithmic to better visualize
  skewed data?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for text within the heatmap?

  7. Are there any additional details or contextual information you would like to
  include, such as tooltips or legends?

  8. Do you prefer the heatmap to have grid lines separating each cell, or should
  the cells be seamlessly connected?'
