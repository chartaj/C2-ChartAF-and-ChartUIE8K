initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize avocado prices, using data from 2015
  for different regions. Highlight dots based on price and volume. Use annotations
  to display specific data points with average prices to emphasize pricing trends.
  This visualization will help understand price fluctuations in regions over time
  and identify significant outliers in avocado prices. The chart aims to provide insights
  into agriculture and farming trends, highlighting key volume and pricing patterns.
  Add color coding or size variations to the dots to make high and low prices stand
  out. Use the available data attributes effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting high and low
  prices?

  2. Would you prefer the dots to vary in color, size, or both to represent price
  variations?

  3. Do you have a specific way you want the annotations to be displayed (e.g., tooltips,
  labels directly on dots)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding or size variations?

  5. Are there specific regions you want to focus on or exclude in the visualization?

  6. Would you like a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for annotations and labels?

  8. Are there any additional data points or metrics that you want to be highlighted
  in the annotations besides average prices?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Both color and size variations would be fine.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining the color coding or size variations.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a specific title or subtitle in mind.

  7. I do not have a preference for the font style or size.

  8. No, just the average prices are fine for the annotations.'
