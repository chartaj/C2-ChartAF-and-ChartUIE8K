initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize average avocado prices by date. Highlight
  the differences between conventional and organic types. Annotate significant price
  peaks and troughs. Include annotations for total volume information. Ensure the
  plot clearly shows regional variations over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating conventional
  and organic avocado types?

  2. How would you like significant price peaks and troughs to be annotated (e.g.,
  text labels, arrows)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style for the annotations of total volume information
  (e.g., tooltips, labels)?

  4. Are there any specific regions you want to focus on or highlight in the visualization?

  5. Would you like to display a legend indicating the type and region directly on
  the chart, or prefer it to be off the chart?

  6. Is there a specific date range you want the plot to focus on?

  7. Do you prefer the dot sizes to vary based on the total volume, or to remain constant?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be included in the plot to facilitate readability?

  9. Are there any specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  10. How detailed do you want the regional variations to be displayed (e.g., individual
  region breakdown, region clusters)?'
