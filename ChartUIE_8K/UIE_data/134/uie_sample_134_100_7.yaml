initial_prompt: I want a line chart to visualize the change in AveragePrice of avocados
  over time. Each line should represent a different region, showing the trend from
  2015 to 2018. Date should be on the x-axis, and AveragePrice on the y-axis, with
  separate lines for each year. This chart will help to compare avocado prices across
  regions and track price fluctuations over the years in the agriculture industry.
  Make sure to label the axes and include a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for colors or color schemes for
  the different lines representing regions?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  4. Do you want any data points highlighted or annotated on the chart (e.g., significant
  price changes or events)?

  5. Is there a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed) you prefer for distinguishing
  the different regions or years?

  6. Do you need any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  8. Would you like to adjust the intervals or formatting of the date labels on the
  x-axis for better clarity?

  9. Are there any additional elements (e.g., data source, notes) you want to be included
  on the chart?'
