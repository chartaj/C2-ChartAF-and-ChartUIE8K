initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the avocado prices dataset. I'm interested
  in comparing the average price of avocados by region for the year 2015. Each bar
  should represent a different region and the height of the bar should correspond
  to the average price. Please ensure that the chart is clear and easy to read with
  labeled axes and a title. Thank you!
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. How would you like the regions to be sorted (alphabetically, by price, or a custom
  order)?

  5. What font style and size would you like for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like the average price values to be displayed on top of the bars?

  7. Do you prefer a specific aspect ratio for the chart?

  8. Is there any additional information or legend you would like to include in the
  chart?'
