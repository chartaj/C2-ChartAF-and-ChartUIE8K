  Yes, please include a title and subtitle. The title should be "Avocado Volume Distribution
  by Region - 2015" and the subtitle "Highlighting the Region with the Highest Volume".


  I am not sure.


  Yes, please emphasize the region with the highest total volume using a different
  color.


  I do not know.


  Yes, display the actual volume values alongside the percentage values.
