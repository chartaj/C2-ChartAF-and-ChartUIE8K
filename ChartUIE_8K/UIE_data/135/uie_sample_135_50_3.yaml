initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between different features
  like 'radius_mean', 'texture_mean', and 'perimeter_mean', etc., in the breast cancer
  dataset. Highlight differences between benign and malignant diagnoses. This is to
  explore feature relationships in breast cancer data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to be normalized across the entire dataset
  or separately for benign and malignant diagnoses?

  3. Should the color legend include specific labels or ranges?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font size and style for labels and annotations?

  5. Would you like gridlines to separate the cells of the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include annotations for the correlation values within the
  cells?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you would prefer for the heatmap?

  8. Do you want to include a hierarchical clustering dendrogram to show the grouping
  of similar features?

  9. Should there be any specific titles or subtitles for the heatmap?

  10. Would you like to include additional elements like data source notes or author
  information?'
