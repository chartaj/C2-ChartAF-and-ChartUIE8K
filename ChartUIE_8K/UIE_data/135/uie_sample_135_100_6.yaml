initial_prompt: I would like to create a pie chart using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin
  (Diagnostic) data set. The pie chart should show the proportion of malignant (M)
  and benign (B) diagnoses based on the 'diagnosis' column from the CSV file. This
  visualization will help in understanding the distribution of cancer cases in the
  dataset. Please ensure that the chart has clear labels and percentages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used for the malignant
  and benign sections?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a title, and if so what should it be?

  3. Do you prefer specific font styles or sizes for the labels and percentages?

  4. Should the pie chart include a legend, or do you prefer labels directly on the
  chart sections?

  5. Would you like the chart to display the actual count of each diagnosis along
  with the percentages?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the placement of the chart (e.g., centered
  on page, specific margins)?

  7. How do you want the labels to be aligned (inside the pie slices, outside, connected
  with lines)?

  8. Are there any specific guidelines or standards you typically follow for visualizations
  in medical research?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Breast Cancer Diagnoses".

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I prefer labels directly on the chart sections.

  5. Yes, please display the actual count along with the percentages.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.
