initial_prompt: I have data from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset, which
  includes various measurements like radius, texture, perimeter, and area for diagnosing
  breast cancer. I need a spline chart that plots 'radius_mean', 'area_mean', and
  'perimeter_mean' over their respective IDs. This visualization should help observe
  any trends or anomalies in these measurements that correspond to different diagnoses
  ('M' and 'B'). Please ensure that the chart differentiates between 'M' (malignant)
  and 'B' (benign) diagnoses using distinct colors or markers. Additionally, a legend
  to explain the color or marker scheme would be helpful.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme to differentiate between
  ''M'' (malignant) and ''B'' (benign) diagnoses?

  2. Should the spline chart include specific markers for each data point, and if
  so, do you have a preference for the type of markers?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to have grid lines to help with reading the values?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the chart to show exact values for ''radius_mean'',
  ''area_mean'', and ''perimeter_mean''?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the data points to be plotted in, such as
  ascending or descending by ID?

  6. Should the spline chart include a title and axis labels, and if so, do you have
  any specific wording in mind?

  7. Would you like to set specific ranges for the axes or should they adjust automatically
  to fit the data?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for labels and legends
  on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I prefer the chart to have grid lines.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. The title could be "Breast Cancer
  Diagnostic Measurements" and the axis labels could be "ID" for the x-axis and "Measurement
  Values" for the y-axis.

  7. The axes should adjust automatically to fit the data.

  8. I am not sure.'
