initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)
  Data Set. The chart should compare the mean values of different features such as
  radius, texture, perimeter, and area for the 'diagnosis' categories ('M' for malignant
  and 'B' for benign). Use separate bars for 'M' and 'B' to easily visualize the differences.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the feature types and the y-axis represents their mean
  values. Include a legend to differentiate between 'M' and 'B'. This will help in
  understanding which features are more indicative of malignant vs. benign diagnoses.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''M'' and ''B'' categories?

  2. What title would you like the chart to have?

  3. Are there any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the bars?

  5. Do you prefer a particular order for the features on the x-axis?

  6. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scaling?

  7. Would you like gridlines in the background of the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the style or placement of the legend?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or notes you want to add to the chart?

  10. Should there be any particular formatting for the mean values on the y-axis
  (e.g., decimal places, units)?'
