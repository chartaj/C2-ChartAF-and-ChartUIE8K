initial_prompt: Hi, I'd like to visualize survey results from Pizza Mercato regarding
  customer satisfaction. Can you create a dot plot for me? I want to see the correlation
  between the answers (Excellent, Good, Average, etc.) and the number of votes each
  answer received. Please display the votes on the y-axis and the different answers
  on the x-axis. Make sure that the dot sizes represent the percentage of total votes.
  For reference, the file named '477.csv' includes the necessary data. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the dot plot?

  2. Should the dots be filled with solid colors or use transparency effects?

  3. Would you like to include labels on the dots indicating the exact percentage
  values?

  4. Do you prefer a title for the chart? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the axes labels'' font size and style?

  7. Is there a specific way you want the x-axis answers to be ordered (e.g., alphabetically,
  by number of votes)?

  8. Should the legend be included to explain the dot sizes representing the percentage
  of total votes?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart background color?

  10. Would you like to include any annotations or notes directly on the chart for
  additional context?'
