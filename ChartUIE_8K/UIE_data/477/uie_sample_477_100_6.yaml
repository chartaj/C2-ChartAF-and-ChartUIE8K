initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart showcasing the feedback on "Pizza Mercato" from
  the given dataset (food-and-drink/pizza_jared). The x-axis should represent different
  answers ("Excellent," "Good," etc.). The y-axis should represent the time. The size
  of the bubbles should indicate the number of votes received. Each bubble's color
  should reflect the question ("How was Pizza Mercato?"), while the position indicates
  the total votes. Ensure the legend explains the color coding for clarity. This will
  help visualize customer satisfaction over time with respect to the different responses.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used for
  the different bubbles?

  2. Would you prefer the bubbles to be transparent or solid in the chart?

  3. Is there a particular time format you prefer for the y-axis (e.g., milliseconds
  since epoch, date, month)?

  4. What level of granularity do you prefer for the time representation (e.g., days,
  weeks, months)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size used in the
  legend and labels?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines or borders for easier reading?

  7. Is there a specific layout or orientation for the legend that you prefer (e.g.,
  vertical, horizontal)?

  8. Would you like to include any trend lines or regression lines to highlight the
  trend further?'
