2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a donut chart that visualizes poll results for "How was Pizza Mercato?" from
  the data provided. The chart should display different answer categories (Excellent,
  Good, Average, etc.) with their corresponding vote percentages. Please highlight
  the category with the highest percentage to make it stand out. Also, add text annotations
  to show the exact percentage values for each category. This visualization will help
  us understand the general customer opinion about Pizza Mercato. Make sure it is
  clear and easy to interpret.
