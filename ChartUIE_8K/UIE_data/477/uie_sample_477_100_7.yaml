initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that shows the distribution of poll answers for
  questions about different places. The data contains information about various questions,
  the places they are about, the responses, and the number of votes each response
  received. I want to see how the votes are distributed across the different answer
  options for each question at specific places. Make sure to highlight the percentages
  of each answer option relative to the total votes. The x-axis should represent the
  different questions/places, and the y-axis should be the percentage of votes. Use
  distinct colors for each answer option.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct colors representing
  each answer option?

  2. Would you like us to include grid lines on the chart for better readability,
  or do you prefer a cleaner look without them?

  3. Is there any specific order in which you want the questions or places arranged
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by total votes, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer the bar labels to be inside the bars or outside the bars on the
  chart?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart, and if so, where should
  it be placed (e.g., top, right, bottom)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  axis titles?

  7. Do you want to include data labels for the percentage of votes directly on the
  bars?

  8. Should the bar chart have any annotations or highlights to emphasize specific
  data points or trends?

  9. Would you like the y-axis to be displayed with percentage signs or as fractions/decimals?'
