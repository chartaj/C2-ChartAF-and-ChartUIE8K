initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset to visualize
  the correlation between various parameters like Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep,
  Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, BMI Category, Blood Pressure, and Heart Rate.
  This will help identify patterns and relationships, such as how physical activity
  affects sleep quality or how stress levels correlate with heart rate. Ensure that
  the missing values, particularly in the Sleep Disorder column, are handled appropriately,
  perhaps by highlighting gaps in data collection. Use color gradients to represent
  different levels of correlation or distribution across the dataset attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have a color gradient preference for the heatmap to represent
  different levels of correlation?

  2. Would you like to include annotations in the heatmap to display correlation values
  on each cell?

  3. How would you prefer missing values to be highlighted in the heatmap?

  4. Should we display a legend to explain the color gradient scale?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the parameters to be displayed
  on the heatmap axes?

  6. Would you prefer any specific font size or style for the labels and annotations?

  7. Should the heatmap include labels for both axes to indicate the parameters?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds of correlation that you would like
  to highlight distinctly?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include annotations to display correlation values on each cell.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, a legend explaining the color gradient scale would be helpful.

  5. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include labels for both axes to indicate the parameters.

  8. I am not sure.'
