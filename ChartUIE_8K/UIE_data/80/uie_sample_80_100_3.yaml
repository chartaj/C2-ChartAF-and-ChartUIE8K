initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart visualizing the distribution of BMI Categories
  in the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. The chart should show the proportions
  of different BMI categories like Underweight, Normal, Overweight, and Obese. This
  will help in understanding the prevalence of different weight categories among the
  participants. Please ensure each slice is labeled with the specific BMI category
  and its percentage value for clarity. Since the dataset includes various health
  and lifestyle metrics, including these categories will provide valuable insights
  into the overall health of the population studied. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the slices representing
  each BMI category?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend alongside the slice labels?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and percentages
  on the slices?

  4. Should the chart have a title? If so, what would you like it to be?

  5. Would you like the chart to include any additional annotations or explanatory
  text?

  6. Do you prefer the slices to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., from largest
  to smallest or in a specific categorical order)?

  7. Should the chart include the total number of participants for context?'
