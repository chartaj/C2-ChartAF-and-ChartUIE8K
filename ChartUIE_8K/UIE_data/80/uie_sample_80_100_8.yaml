initial_prompt: Please create a Dumbbell chart to analyze the relationship between
  Age and Sleep Duration for different Occupations in the Sleep Health and Lifestyle
  Dataset. Plot Age on the x-axis and Sleep Duration on the y-axis. Use different
  colors to distinguish between Various Occupations. Highlight data points for individuals
  with and without reported Sleep Disorders. This will help visualize variations in
  sleep duration across different age groups and occupations, shedding light on how
  professional roles impact sleep patterns. Ensure the chart is clean, labeled, and
  easily interpretable. This visual can help in devising occupation-specific sleep
  health recommendations.

  different occupations?
