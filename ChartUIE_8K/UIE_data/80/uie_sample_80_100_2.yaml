initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the Sleep Health and Lifestyle
  Dataset. Use 'Age' on the x-axis and 'Sleep Duration' on the y-axis. Color the points
  based on 'Gender' and size them according to 'Quality of Sleep'. Highlight points

  a legend for clarity.

  7. Do you have any preferences toward the style or font for labels and titles?'
