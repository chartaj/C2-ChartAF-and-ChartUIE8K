initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between key health metrics
  like Sleep Duration, Quality of Sleep, Physical Activity Level, Stress Level, Daily
  Steps, and BMI Category for different occupations and age groups.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used in the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer the heatmap to include specific color gradients for positive
  and negative correlations?

  3. Should the heatmap display exact correlation values within the cells?

  4. Do you want to include axis labels for each metric and category, and if so, should
  they be rotated for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the categories to be arranged in (e.g.,
  ascending or descending)?

  6. Would you prefer to use a specific font style or size for the labels and titles
  in the heatmap?

  7. Should the occupations and age groups be grouped or categorized in a particular
  way?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights within the heatmap to draw
  attention to certain correlations?

  9. Are there any specific metrics within the data that you would like to emphasize
  or deprioritize?'
