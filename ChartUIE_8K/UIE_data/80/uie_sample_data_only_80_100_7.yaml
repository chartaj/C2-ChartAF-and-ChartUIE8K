  Each bar should represent an occupation and be divided into segments for different
  sleep quality levels (e.g., 1-6). Additionally, please indicate the number of daily
  steps for each occupation, perhaps as a secondary y-axis or color gradient. The
  goal is to understand how occupation correlates with sleep quality and activity
