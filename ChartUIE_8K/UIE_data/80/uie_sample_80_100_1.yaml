initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing the average sleep duration
  and stress level across different occupations. Highlight occupations with higher
  stress levels and shorter sleep durations. Add text annotations to display the average
  values for these highlighted occupations. Ensure the legend differentiates between
  sleep duration and stress level. This visualization is intended to emphasize the
  correlation between occupation, sleep quality, and stress levels, helping viewers
  to quickly identify which professions exhibit higher stress and poor sleep health.
  The goal is to enhance understanding of lifestyle impacts on sleep health.
