initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the Sleep Health and Lifestyle
  Dataset. Specifically, I want to compare the sleep quality across different occupations.
  Each bar should represent an occupation and be divided into segments for different
  sleep quality levels (e.g., 1-6). Additionally, please indicate the number of daily
  steps for each occupation, perhaps as a secondary y-axis or color gradient. The
  goal is to understand how occupation correlates with sleep quality and activity
  levels. Ensure all relevant details like sleep duration, stress levels, and BMI
  categories are represented clearly. Title the chart "Occupation vs. Sleep Quality
  and Activity Levels".
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the chart, especially for
  the different sleep quality levels?

  2. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color gradient for daily steps?

  3. How should the secondary y-axis for daily steps be labeled and positioned?

  4. Is there a preference for how the stress levels and BMI categories are represented
  in the chart?

  5. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart title and labels?

  6. Are there any specific occupations or sleep quality levels you want to highlight
  or emphasize?

  7. Do you need any additional annotations or notes on the chart to explain key findings?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color schemes for the different sleep
  quality levels.

  2. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color gradient for daily steps.

  3. I am not sure how the secondary y-axis for daily steps should be labeled and
  positioned.

  4. I do not know how the stress levels and BMI categories should be represented
  in the chart.

  5. I have no specific preference for the font style or size for the chart title
  and labels.

  6. I do not have any specific occupations or sleep quality levels to highlight or
  emphasize.

  7. I am not sure if additional annotations or notes are needed to explain key findings.'
