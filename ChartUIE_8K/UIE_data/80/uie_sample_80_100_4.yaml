initial_prompt: I need a violin plot for visualizing the distribution of sleep duration
  across different age groups. The plot should display the density of sleep duration
  data and how it varies with age. Each age group should be represented by a different
  color to easily distinguish between them. Please make sure to include the median
  sleep duration for each age group as well. Additionally, highlight any outliers
  in the data, especially if they might indicate potential sleep disorders. This visualization
  will help in understanding the relationship between age and sleep patterns in this
  health dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between age
  groups?

  2. How many distinct age groups would you like to see on the plot?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for labeling the median sleep duration for
  each group?

  4. Do you want to highlight outliers with specific markers or colors?

  5. Is there a specific age range you are particularly interested in focusing on?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines or axis labels for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer the plot to have a title or any annotations? If so, what should
  they be?

  8. Are there any specific formatting styles you want for the axes or legend?

  9. Should the plot include any additional statistical summaries or information besides
  the median sleep duration?

  10. Do you have any preference for the plot''s overall layout or aspect ratio?'
