initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the relationship between
  'Age' and 'Sleep Duration' from the Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset. Additionally,
  include 'Physical Activity Level' and 'Stress Level' as separate line series in
  the same chart to see how these factors correlate with 'Age'. Ensure the x-axis
  represents 'Age' and the y-axis includes the other variables. Illustrate trends
  across different age groups, and use different colors for each line. Include a legend
  to differentiate the lines and make the chart easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the style or type of lines used in the
  chart (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  2. Do you have specific color preferences for each line representing ''Sleep Duration'',
  ''Physical Activity Level'', and ''Stress Level''?

  3. What is your preferred font style and size for the chart labels and legend?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart? If so, do you have any preferences
  regarding their appearance?

  5. Are there any particular axis limits or scaling preferences (e.g., logarithmic
  scale) for the y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for the age groups on the x-axis (e.g., specific
  age ranges)?

  7. Would you like to highlight any specific age intervals or data points within
  the chart?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include (e.g.,
  average lines, specific event indicators)?

  9. Do you prefer a specific location for the legend on the chart?'
