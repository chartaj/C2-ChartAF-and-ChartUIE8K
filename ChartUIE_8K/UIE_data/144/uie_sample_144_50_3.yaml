initial_prompt: Create a box chart to analyze the distribution of people and minors
  left homeless across different districts. Use "housing_units" to see variations
  in demolition reasons.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include labels for outliers and extreme values?

  3. Do you want the data points to be marked individually within the box plots?

  4. Would you like to display mean values along with the medians in the box plots?

  5. Should the chart have gridlines for easier value estimation?

  6. Do you have a preference for the axis scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like the districts to be ordered in a particular way (e.g., alphabetically,
  by number of demolitions)?

  8. Should annotations be included for significant findings or trends?

  9. Do you need a legend to distinguish between ''people left homeless'' and ''minors
  left homeless'' data within the same chart?

  10. How should the "reason_for_demolition" be represented in the chart (e.g., different
  colors, separate plots)?'
