initial_prompt: 'I need a column chart to visualize the provided dataset on Palestinian
  structures demolished by Israel. The chart should include the number of demolitions
  as the primary axis, with the following categories on the other axis: "locality,"
  "district," "area," "housing_units," "people_left_homeless," and "minors_left_homeless."
  Each column should represent one of these categories, and its height should correspond
  to the number of demolitions or affected measures (like people left homeless). Add
  a legend for clarity and use different colors for each category. The title of the
  chart should be "Demolitions of Palestinian Structures by Israel."'
