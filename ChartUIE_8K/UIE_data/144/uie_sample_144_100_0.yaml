initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the number of Palestinian structures
  demolished in the West Bank, categorized by type (Residential, Non-Residential)
  and district (Hebron, Tulkarm). The x-axis should represent the districts, while
  the y-axis shows the count of demolished structures. Use different colors for Residential
  and Non-Residential structures. Incorporate text annotations to highlight the total
  housing units affected and the reasons for demolition. Use highlights to emphasize
  districts with the highest demolitions. This visualization helps in understanding
  the impact of demolition on various districts and types of structures.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for Residential and Non-Residential
  structures?

  2. Would you like to display the total housing units affected as numerical values
  on the chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like the highlighted districts to be emphasized
  (e.g., brighter colors, bold outlines)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order in which the districts appear on the x-axis?

  6. Should the y-axis start from zero, or would you prefer an adjusted range to better
  visualize differences?

  7. Are there any specific reasons for demolition that you want highlighted more
  prominently on the chart?

  8. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or footnotes on
  the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred background color or grid style for the chart?

  10. Would you like the chart legend to be placed at a specific location (e.g., top,
  bottom, side)?'
