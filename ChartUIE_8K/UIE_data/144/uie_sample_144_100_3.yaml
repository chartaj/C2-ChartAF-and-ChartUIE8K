initial_prompt: Create a box plot for the dataset "Data on Palestinian Structures
  Israel Demolished." The plot should visualize the distribution of 'housing_units'
  demolished across different 'districts'. Additionally, please include a separate
  box plot for 'people_left_homeless' and 'minors_left_homeless' categorized by 'type_of_structure'.
  Make sure to handle any missing data appropriately and label the axes clearly. Use
  distinct colors for each category to enhance readability. This visualization will
  help in understanding the impact of demolitions across different regions and types
  of structures.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color palette to be used for
  different categories in the box plots?

  2. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the axis labels and titles?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included or excluded for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific regions or types of structures that should be highlighted
  or emphasized in the visualization?

  5. How would you prefer missing data to be handled in the visualizations?

  6. Do you have any preferences on the scale (e.g., log scale) of the axes?

  7. Should the box plots include data points (e.g., outliers) or just the summary
  statistics (median, quartiles)?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font for text labels and titles?

  9. Are there any other annotations or specific information that you would like to
  be added to the plots?'
