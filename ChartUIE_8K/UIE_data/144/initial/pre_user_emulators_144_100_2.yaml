2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap visualizing the data on Palestinian structures demolished by Israel.
  The heatmap should highlight the number of demolitions by district and reason for
  demolition. Annotations should describe trends or interesting points, such as districts
  with the highest demolitions or common reasons. Use color gradients to show varying
  frequencies of demolitions. The chart's purpose is to provide an insightful visual
  representation of the impact of demolitions across different districts for policy
  discussions and humanitarian aid planning.
