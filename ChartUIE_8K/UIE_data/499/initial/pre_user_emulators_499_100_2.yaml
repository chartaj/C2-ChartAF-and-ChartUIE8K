- 'I have a dataset with columns ''x'' and ''y'', where both are of float type with
  no missing values. Create a scatter plot to visualize this data. Highlight specific
  data points: for ''x'' values of 0.0, 1.0, and 2.0, show their corresponding ''y''
  values as text annotations. Use different colors or sizes for these points to make
  them stand out. The goal is to emphasize these key points for further analysis,
  ensuring they are visually distinct to draw immediate attention. Provide context
  and insights on these points to help grasp the overall data trend.'
