initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the given data, highlighting data points
  to emphasize values. Add text annotations to some data points to draw attention

  2. Are there specific data points you want to annotate or should they be based on

  exact values, labels)?

  4. Should the axes be labeled in a specific way or use a particular format?

  5. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to add to the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have preferences for the size and style of the markers used in the scatter
  plot?

  7. How would you prefer the highlighted data points to be distinguished (e.g., different
  colors, larger size)?

  8. Should the plot include a legend, and if so, what information should it convey?

  9. Are there any gridlines or background elements you would like to include or exclude
  for clarity?'
