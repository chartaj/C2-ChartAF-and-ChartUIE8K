initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the relationship between column 'x'
  and column 'y' in the dataset. Annotate specific key data points to highlight critical
  values and trends. Use text annotations to draw attention to significant peaks and
  troughs. The goal is to make it easier to identify patterns and outliers in the
  data. Additionally, implement highlights to emphasize major data trends using different
  colors or sizes. The final visualization should be clear, concise, and geared towards
  data-driven insights. This visualization will help in understanding the underlying
  patterns and variability within the dataset.

  6. Are there any specific legends or labels you want to include to enhance clarity?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the title and labels of the
