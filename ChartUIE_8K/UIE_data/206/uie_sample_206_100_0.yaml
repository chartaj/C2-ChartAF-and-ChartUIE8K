initial_prompt: I want a bar chart that shows the relationship between different furnishing
  statuses and average housing prices. Use the summary and sample data from the Housing
  Prices Dataset. Ensure to highlight key statistics and data points, such as price
  variations for each furnishing status (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished).
  Add text annotations for the highest and lowest averages to draw attention. Also,
  make certain elements, like the highest average price, stand out visually by using
  different colors or sizes. This will help in understanding how furnishing status
  impacts housing prices.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be horizontally or vertically oriented?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like the highest and lowest averages to be highlighted (e.g., using
  different colors, sizes, or adding markers)?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of values, and if so,
  what style should they be?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and labels, and if so, any particular
  wording for them?

  7. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should it be placed?

  8. Are there any specific chart elements or design elements you want to avoid?'
