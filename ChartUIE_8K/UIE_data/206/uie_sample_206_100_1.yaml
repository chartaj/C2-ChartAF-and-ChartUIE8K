initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of housing
  prices by furnishing status and availability of air conditioning. Use color to differentiate
  between furnishing levels (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished). Annotate key
  data points to highlight differences in price ranges for each category. The chart
  should emphasize areas and pattern variations. Highlight areas with significant
  differences. This visualization helps understand how furnishing and air conditioning
  impact housing prices, useful for real-estate stakeholders. Make sure it is easy
  to interpret and compare different categories based on stacking and annotation.
