initial_prompt: Create a treemap for the Housing Prices Dataset showcasing the distribution
  of prices based on area, with additional breakdowns for the number of bedrooms,
  bathrooms, and stories. Highlight the impact of features like mainroad, guestroom,
  basement, and airconditioning across different price segments.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different price segments?

  5. How would you like to represent the features like mainroad, guestroom, basement,
  and airconditioning - through colors, patterns, or any other visual indicators?

  6. Would you prefer a single treemap visualization or separate visualizations for
  each breakdown (bedrooms, bathrooms, stories)?

  7. Should we include legends for better interpretability of categorical features
  like mainroad, guestroom, basement, and airconditioning?

  8. How much detail would you prefer in the breakdowns - should we group some categories
  together or show all distinct values?

  the treemap?

  10. Do you have any preferences for font styles or sizes used in the treemap?'
