initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the Housing Prices Dataset. Please create a
  pie chart that shows the distribution of different furnishing statuses (furnished,
  semi-furnished, unfurnished) in the dataset. Each segment should represent the proportion
  of houses with each furnishing status. This will help us understand the most common
  furnishing status among the houses listed. You can use the sample data if needed.
  Make sure the chart is labeled clearly for easy interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the pie
  chart?

  2. Would you like to display the exact percentage values on each segment of the
  pie chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used in the chart labels?

  4. Should the chart include a legend indicating each furnishing status?

  5. Do you prefer a specific order for the segments, such as ascending or descending
  by proportion?

  6. Would you like to add a title and/or subtitle to the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the size and aspect ratio of the pie chart?'
