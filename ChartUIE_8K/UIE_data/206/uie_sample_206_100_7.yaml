initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of housing
  prices and areas in the Housing Prices Dataset. For the "price" and "area" columns,
  use the data to show the range, quartiles, and any outliers. This will help us understand
  the central tendency and spread of these variables. Additionally, include separate
  box plots for different categories of "furnishingstatus" to see how price and area
  distributions vary across furnished, semi-furnished, and unfurnished properties.
  This will give a comprehensive look at how furnishing impacts prices and areas in
  real estate.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different "furnishingstatus"
  categories in the box plot?

  2. Would you like to include a title for each box plot? If so, please specify the
  title.

  3. Are there any specific labels you would like on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the box plots (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Would you like to display the mean values in addition to the quartiles and outliers
  on the box plots?

  6. Do you have any preference for the style or format of the whiskers?

  7. Should the plot include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located?

  8. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the box plots?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text elements in
  the chart (titles, labels, legends, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the titles.

  3. Labels should be "Price" on the y-axis and "Furnishing Status" on the x-axis
  for the price box plot. For the area box plot, use "Area" on the y-axis and "Furnishing
  Status" on the x-axis.

  4. Vertical orientation is preferred.

  5. Yes, please display the mean values.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the whisker style.
