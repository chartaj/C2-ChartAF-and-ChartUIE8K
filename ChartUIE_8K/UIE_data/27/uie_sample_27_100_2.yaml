initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing Automobile Sales data. Use text annotations
  to highlight the sales figures and emphasize elements like "Order Number" and "Customer
  Name." The chart should also highlight significant cities, such as NYC, Reims, and
  Paris, by using distinct colors to make them stand out. Display the sales on the
  y-axis and the cities on the x-axis. The purpose is to easily compare sales across
  different locations and identify major customers. Additionally, include data-driven
  text annotations to show exact sales values on each bar for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting significant
  cities like NYC, Reims, and Paris?

  2. How would you like the text annotations formatted? Do you prefer any particular
  font size, style, or color?

  3. Should the order of the cities on the x-axis follow any specific sorting criteria
  (e.g., alphabetical, by sales volume)?

  4. Is there a preferred width for the bars in the chart?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability? If so, should they
  be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis labels in terms of content
  and formatting?

  7. Would you like a legend included in the chart to specify the color coding for
  the cities?

  in the chart for clarity or aesthetics?'
