initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the SALES versus ORDERDATE for the automobile
  sales data. Each dot should represent a unique ORDERNUMBER. Use different colors
  to distinguish STATUS (e.g., Shipped, Cancelled, etc.). Additionally, differentiate
  the DEALSIZE using dot sizes (e.g., Small, Medium, Large). This visualization should
  help identify trends and patterns in sales over time, the status of the orders,
  and the deal sizes for better insights into automobile sales. Make sure to label
  the axes and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for distinguishing different
  statuses?

  2. How would you like the DEALSIZE categories (e.g., Small, Medium, Large) to be
  represented in terms of dot sizes?

  3. Do you have a preference for the format of the ORDERDATE on the x-axis (e.g.,
  month/year, day/month/year)?

  4. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the background color or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  light, dark)?

  7. Should any specific periods or significant dates be highlighted on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific statistical indicators (e.g., moving averages) you would
  like overlaid on the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color palette, surprise me!

  2. I would like the dot sizes to be proportional to the DEALSIZE categories, with
  Small being smallest, Medium being larger, and Large being the largest.

  3. Month/year format for the ORDERDATE on the x-axis would be good.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines on the chart for better readability.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  6. I do not know, Iâ€™m open to any background color or theme.

  7. I do not know of any specific periods or significant dates to be highlighted.

  8. I am not sure about any specific statistical indicators to be overlaid on the
  plot.'
