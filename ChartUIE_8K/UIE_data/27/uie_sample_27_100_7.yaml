initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of 'STATUS' in the
  Automobile Sales data. The pie chart should show the proportion of each unique status
  (e.g., Shipped, Canceled, Resolved, On Hold, In Process, Disputed) in the dataset.
  Use different colors for each status and include percentages to illustrate the data
  clearly. This will help us understand the overall status of our automobile orders.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret with appropriate labels for each
  section. Use the provided data summary and sample data to guide the chart creation.

  4. Do you have any preference for the font type and size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like the chart to include any additional annotations or insights?'
