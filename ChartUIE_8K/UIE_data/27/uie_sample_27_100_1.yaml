initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'SALES'
  from the automobile sales data. Use text annotations to highlight the average, median,
  and any outliers in sales. Utilize highlights to differentiate between various sales
  ranges, emphasizing large deal sizes with a distinct color. The chart should serve
  to quickly understand sales performance, showing how often specific sales amounts
  occur and spotlighting extraordinary sales figures. Include annotations to provide
  context, such as the number of orders resulting in large deals. The diagram should
  be clear and informative, aiding in making data-driven decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram, especially
  for highlighting the large deal sizes?

  2. What specific sales range thresholds would you like to use for the highlights?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be distinguished in the histogram?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the text annotations?

  5. Should we include gridlines in the histogram for better readability, or do you
  prefer a clean look?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the x-axis (sales amounts) and y-axis
  (frequency) to be labeled?

  7. Would you like a legend to specify what each color and annotation represents?

  8. Do you have a preference for the bin size or number of bins in the histogram?

  9. Are there any particular arrangements or placements you prefer for the text annotations
  and highlights on the chart?

  10. Would you like the average, median, and outliers to be displayed as specific
  icons or markers on the histogram? If so, do you have a preference for the type
  of marker used?'
