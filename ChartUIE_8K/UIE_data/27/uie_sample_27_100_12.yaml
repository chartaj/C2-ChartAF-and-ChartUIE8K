initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the sales data from the provided
  automobile sales dataset. Use the "COUNTRY" field to highlight different regions,
  and the "SALES" field to determine the color intensity, representing the total sales
  amount for each country. Ensure the countries with higher sales amounts are shaded
  more darkly. Differentiate between small, medium, and large deal sizes by using
  patterns or textures overlaid on the color shading. Include a legend to explain
  the color and pattern coding. The map should also display city markers for additional
  context.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for representing different
  sales amounts?

  2. What patterns or textures would you prefer to differentiate small, medium, and
  large deal sizes?

  3. How would you like the city markers to be represented (e.g., size, color, shape)?

  4. Is there any specific range or threshold for sales amounts that you want highlighted
  in the legend?

  5. Do you prefer to see the country names annotated on the map?

  6. Should the map have any specific geographical boundaries or focus on certain
  continents or regions?

  7. Will the map be used for print or digital presentations, and if digital, on what
  kind of screen or resolution?

  8. Are there any branding guidelines or color restrictions we need to follow?

  9. Should any additional information be included in tooltips when hovering over
  countries or cities?

  10. Do you prefer a specific orientation or projection for the map (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?'
