02_initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Automobile Sales data. I'm
  interested in visualizing the relationship between SALES and QUANTITYORDERED. Plot
  the SALES on the Y-axis and QUANTITYORDERED on the X-axis. Use different colors
  or markers for different STATUS categories (like 'Shipped,' 'Pending,' etc.). Also,
  it would be helpful to add a trendline to see any patterns or correlations between
  these variables. Adding labels for different DEALSIZE categories will also help
  in understanding the distribution and sales performance across different order sizes.
  Thanks!

  Please create a scatter plot using the Automobile Sales data. I''m interested in
  visualizing the relationship between SALES and QUANTITYORDERED. Plot the SALES on
  the Y-axis and QUANTITYORDERED on the X-axis. Use different colors or markers for
  different STATUS categories (like ''Shipped,'' ''Pending,'' etc.). Also, it would
  be helpful to add a trendline to see any patterns or correlations between these
  variables. Adding labels for different DEALSIZE categories will also help in understanding
  the distribution and sales performance across different order sizes. Thanks!
