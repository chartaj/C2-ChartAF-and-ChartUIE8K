initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart using the provided data. The chart
  should compare the "Overall score" of countries within each "Major Area" and "Regions".
  It should emphasize the differences in food security indices among different areas
  and regions. Use distinct colors for each major area and region combination to make
  comparisons easier. Include a legend and labels for clarity. This will help visualize
  the food security across Europe effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct colors for each
  major area and region combination?

  chart title, axis titles)?

  4. Would you like to include data values on top of the bars for precise comparison?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should we display error bars or confidence intervals for the "Overall score"
  if available?

  in the chart?

  to be sorted?'
