initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the Global Food Security Index
  data. The heatmap should display 'Major Area' on one axis and 'Country' on the other,
  with color intensity representing the 'Overall score'. Annotate the data points
  with text annotations to highlight the top five scores and add contextual notes
  where applicable. Use highlights to differentiate regions with missing values in
  the 'Regions' column. This will help us to focus on areas that may need attention.
  The purpose is to analyze the food security levels across different regions and
  countries effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the annotation text to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific highlights or color coding for regions with missing
  values in the ''Regions'' column?

  4. Would you like a specific title for the heatmap?

  5. Should there be specific labels or legends for the ''Major Area'' and ''Country''
  axes?

  6. Are there any specific contextual notes you would like to include in the annotations?

  7. Do you have a preference for the ordering of ''Major Area'' or ''Country'' on
  the axes (e.g., alphabetical, by score)?

  8. Would you like any additional visual elements such as grid lines or borders to
  differentiate the cells in the heatmap?'
