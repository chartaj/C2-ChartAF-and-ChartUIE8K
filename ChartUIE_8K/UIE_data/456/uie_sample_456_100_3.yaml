initial_prompt: I want a dot plot that visualizes the relationship between regions
  and overall food security scores based on the Global Food Security Index. Each dot
  should represent a country within its region, colored by the major area. The x-axis
  should list regions (like NEU and WEU), and the y-axis should display overall scores.
  Ensure to highlight regions with missing values distinctly. It should allow easy
  comparison of food security across different regions and countries within Europe,
  showing trends and outliers clearly. Include appropriate labels and legends for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different major areas?

  2. How would you like the regions with missing values to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, pattern, icon)?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Should outliers be marked in any particular way (e.g., different shape or size)?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and legends?

  6. Do you require grid lines on the chart? If so, in which direction(s)?

  7. Would you like to include a title on the chart? If yes, please specify the title.

  8. Is there a specific format you prefer for the tooltips (information displayed
  when hovering over a dot)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement on the chart?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you would like
  to include on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. A different color would be fine to highlight regions with missing values.

  3. I do not have any specific requirements for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Yes, grid lines could be helpful; in both directions.

  7. Yes, the title can be "Food Security Scores Across European Regions."

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. I do not know.'
