initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the 'Overall score' across different
  'Regions' to highlight food security variations. Annotate the top three 'Country'
  scores in each 'Region' to emphasize distinctions. Ensure that missing 'Regions'
  data is addressed. This visualization supports a global food security index analysis,
  targeting stakeholders in the food and drink sector. Include text annotations for
  scores above 85 to draw attention to top performers. Highlight regions with lower
  food security scores to emphasize areas needing improvement. This chart will illustrate
  key trends and draw focus to critical data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting regions with
  lower food security scores?

  2. Would you like particular styles or formatting for the text annotations for scores
  above 85?

  3. How would you prefer to handle missing ''Regions'' data in the visualization?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for how the top three country scores in
  each region should be annotated?

  5. Are there any particular labels or titles you would like to include in the chart
  for clarity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color scheme for highlighting regions
  with lower food security scores.

  2. I do not know any particular styles or formatting for the text annotations for
  scores above 85.

  3. Handle missing ''Regions'' data by possibly grouping them into an ''Unknown''
  category.

  4. I do not have specific preferences for annotating the top three country scores
  in each region.

  5. I would like the chart to include titles like "Food Security Index by Region"
  and labels for axes as "Region" and "Overall Score."'
