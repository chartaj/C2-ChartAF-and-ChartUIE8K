initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the number of digital TV stations for each
  city in the dataset. The X-axis should represent the cities, and the Y-axis should
  display the count of stations. Include all cities mentioned under the "CITY" column
  and ensure the chart is labeled appropriately with a title and axis labels. Use
  different colors for each bar to make it visually appealing. Additionally, include
  a legend to differentiate the service types if possible. This will help in understanding
  the distribution of digital TV stations across various cities.
