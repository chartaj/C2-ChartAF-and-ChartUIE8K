initial_prompt: Create a heatmap of Digital TV Station Transmitter Data showing ERP
  (Effective Radiated Power) values across different cities and states. Use 'CITY'
  for the y-axis and 'STATE' for the x-axis. The heatmap color intensity should represent
  the ERP values converted to numeric units (kW) across the various locations. Highlight
  data points with missing or zero ERP values prominently. Include a gradient color
  bar to represent the ERP value range on the side. The goal is to visualize how ERP
  distribution varies geographically, helping to identify areas with higher or lower
  transmitter power.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing the ERP values
  on the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the data points with missing or zero ERP values to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific color, pattern)?

  3. What range of ERP values should the gradient color bar cover?

  4. Do you have a specific layout or orientation preference for the gradient color
  bar (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Are there any specific cities or states you want to highlight or focus on in
  the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred size for the heatmap (e.g., dimensions in pixels or inches)?

  7. Should the labels for ''CITY'' and ''STATE'' be styled in a particular way (e.g.,
  font size, color, orientation)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the heatmap
  to provide more context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
