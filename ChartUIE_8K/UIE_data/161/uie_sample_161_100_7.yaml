initial_prompt: I need a histogram created from the Digital TV Station Transmitter
  Data under media-and-communications. The histogram should display the distribution
  of the Effective Radiated Power (ERP) across different stations in kilowatts (kW).
  The ERP values seem to range from 0 to 16 kW, so the histogram should have appropriate
  bins to clearly show how these values are distributed. This will help visualize
  how many stations fall into different ERP ranges. Including labels and a title for
  clarity would be appreciated. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  2. What labels would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the histogram?

  4. How many bins would you like for the histogram, or should I determine this based
  on the data range?

  5. Should the bins have equal width, or would you like custom bin ranges?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the histogram for better readability?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font size or style for the labels and title?

  8. Should the histogram include a legend, or will the labels and title suffice?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. x-axis: Effective Radiated Power (kW), y-axis: Number of Stations

  3. I do not know.

  4. Determine this based on the data range, please.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines.

  7. I do not know.

  8. The labels and title should suffice.'
