initial_prompt: Create a Treemap for Digital TV Station Transmitter Data, focused
  on 'CALLSIGN', 'CITY', and 'STATE'. Use color to highlight different 'SERVICE' types.
  Employ text annotations to display 'ERP' and 'HAAT' values for key stations, drawing
  attention to significant data points. The purpose is to provide a clear visual representation
  of the distribution and characteristics of TV transmitters in the media and communications
  sector, making it easy to identify patterns and key information at a glance. Make
  sure the chart emphasizes differences between stations and their transmission power.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different ''SERVICE''
  types?

  2. How would you like the key stations to be identified for text annotations displaying
  ''ERP'' and ''HAAT'' values?

  3. Do you want annotations to be displayed for all data points or only for stations
  that meet certain criteria?

  4. Is there a specific way you prefer the ''ERP'' and ''HAAT'' values to be formatted
  or displayed (e.g., units, decimal places)?

  5. Would you like any additional labels or legends included in the treemap for better
  understanding?

  6. Are there specific patterns or key information you are more interested in highlighting
  through the visualization?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the size and layout of the treemap blocks
  (e.g., based on ''ERP'', alphabetical by ''CALLSIGN'')?

  8. Would you like to include any interactive features such as hover-over text for
  more details on each station?
