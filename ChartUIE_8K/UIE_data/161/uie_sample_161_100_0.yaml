initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the Effective Radiated Power (ERP)
  distribution across different TV channels. Highlight the outliers and add text annotations
  for channels with significantly higher ERP values. The purpose is to easily compare
  power levels across channels and identify any anomalies or outliers. This will help
  in understanding transmission power variations among different channels and ensuring
  they meet regulatory requirements. Provide context on the X-axis for channel numbers
  and Y-axis for ERP in kilowatts. The chart should also differentiate between the
  service types to offer more detailed insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between service
  types?

  2. What style of text annotations do you prefer for channels with significantly
  higher ERP values? (e.g., bold, italic, different color)

  3. Would you like a grid background in the chart?

  4. Should the outliers be marked with specific symbols? If yes, which symbols do
  you prefer?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of text labels on the X-axis?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  7. Would you like to include a legend for the service types? If yes, where should
  it be positioned?

  8. Is there a specific title that you would like to give to the chart?

  9. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical display of box charts?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer bold text annotations for channels with significantly higher ERP values.

  3. Yes, I would like a grid background in the chart.

  4. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, I would like to include a legend for the service types, preferably positioned
  on the right side.

  8. Yes, the title should be "ERP Distribution Across TV Channels with Outliers Highlighted."

  9. I prefer a vertical display of box charts.'
