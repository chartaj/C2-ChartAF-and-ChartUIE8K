initial_prompt: Generate a violin plot to visualize the resistance of breast cancer
  cell lines to Taxol. Plot logFC on the y-axis to show the distribution of fold change
  in gene expression across the four cell lines. Annotate significant genes, particularly
  those with extreme logFC values, to highlight their P.Value. Use color to distinguish
  between the cell lines and add text annotations for top genes like EDIL3, IGFBP7,
  and TFPI. This will help understand which genes are most affected in each cell line
  and their potential role in drug resistance.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  between the cell lines?

  2. Would you like a particular style or size for the text annotations for the top
  genes?

  3. Do you have preferred scaling for the y-axis (logFC) values?

  4. Should the violin plot include additional statistical markers, such as the median
  or quartiles, within each distribution?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font or font size for axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you want the plot to include grid lines or a background color for better readability?

  7. How would you like the significant genes and their P.Value to be annotated (e.g.,
  tooltip, labels, color-coded)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the overall plot?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about the style or size for the text annotations.

  3. I am not sure about the preferred scaling for the y-axis values.

  4. Yes, please include additional statistical markers, such as the median or quartiles.

  5. I do not know about the font or font size for axis labels and titles.

  6. Yes, I would prefer the plot to include grid lines for better readability.

  7. I would like the significant genes and their P.Value to be annotated with labels.

  8. I have no specific preference for the aspect ratio or size of the overall plot.
