- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

- Create a heatmap to visualize the gene expression levels (logFC) of different genes
  in Taxol drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Use Gene.symbol for rows and Cell
  Line for columns, with cell colors representing the logFC values. Include text annotations
  for gene symbols with the lowest P.Value and highlights to emphasize key cell lines.
