initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the differential gene expression
  in Taxol-resistant breast cancer cell lines. The chart should display the 'Cell
  Line' on the x-axis, with different colors representing each unique 'Gene.symbol'.
  The y-axis should show the log fold change ('logFC') values. Each cell line should
  have stacked bars showing the logFC for different genes, and labels should indicate
  the corresponding 'P.Value'. This will help us understand how specific genes are
  upregulated or downregulated in different cell lines in response to Taxol.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for distinguishing different ''Gene.symbol''
  categories?

  2. Do you want the bars to have any specific ordering within each ''Cell Line''?

  3. What font style and size would you like for axis labels and titles?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the range or scaling of the y-axis (logFC
  values)?

  5. Would you like a legend, and if so, where should it be placed?

  6. How would you like the ''P.Value'' labels formatted—in terms of font size, placement,
  and any specific notation?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout and size of the chart?

  8. Would you prefer gridlines on the chart for better readability of the values,
  especially on the y-axis?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would want to highlight specific
  genes or values?

  10. Do you want any specific background color or design for the chart to enhance
  readability or visual appeal?'
answers: '1. I''m not sure, any visually distinct palette will work.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the ordering.

  3. I am not sure about the font style, but a legible size would be good.

  4. I do not have a specific preference; use what is standard.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful. You can place it wherever it fits best.

  6. I am not sure about the formatting details, just make the P.Values clear and
  readable.

  7. I have no specific preferences for the layout and size.

  8. Yes, gridlines on the y-axis would be helpful for readability.

  9. I do not need additional annotations or markers.

  10. I do not have any specific preference for the background color—whatever enhances
  readability is fine.'
