initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of logFC values
  across different cell lines, highlighting key genes like EDIL3, IGFBP7, and TFPI
  involved in Taxol drug resistance in breast cancer. Add annotations for significant
  P-values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different cell lines
  in the violin plot?

  2. How would you like the key genes (EDIL3, IGFBP7, TFPI) to be highlighted within
  the plot?

  3. Do you prefer the significant P-values to be displayed as text annotations or
  in another format?

  4. Do you want the axes to be labeled in any specific way?

  5. Do you have any particular requirements for the title and subtitles of the plot?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, how would you like it to be formatted?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to be used within
  the chart?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have grid lines, and if so, how would you like them
  to be styled?

  9. Should the violin plot include any specific statistical summary lines (e.g.,
  mean, median)?

  10. Do you have preferences on the orientation of the plot (horizontal or vertical)?'
