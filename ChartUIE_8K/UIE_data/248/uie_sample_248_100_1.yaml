initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the gene expression levels (logFC) of
  different genes in Taxol drug-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Use Gene.symbol
  for rows and Cell Line for columns, with cell colors representing the logFC values.
  Include text annotations for gene symbols with the lowest P.Value and highlights
  to emphasize key cell lines.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you prefer for representing different ranges
  of logFC values?

  2. What threshold would you like to set for highlighting key cell lines?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font size or style for the text annotations of gene
  symbols?

  4. How would you like the heatmap to handle the range of logFC values (e.g., should
  it be standardized or normalized)?

  5. Are there specific color schemes you prefer for annotations, especially for the
  genes with the lowest P.Value?

  6. Do you want gridlines to be visible or hidden on the heatmap?

  7. Should the color legend for logFC values be displayed on a specific side of the
  heatmap (top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Would you like the axis labels (Gene.symbol and Cell Line) to be rotated at a
  specific angle for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I would like the heatmap to handle the range of logFC values by standardizing
  them.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for color schemes for annotations.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not know.'
