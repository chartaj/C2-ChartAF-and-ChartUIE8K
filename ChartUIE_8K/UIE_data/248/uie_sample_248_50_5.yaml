initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing logFC values of top 3 Gene.symbols (EDIL3,
  IGFBP7, TFPI) in BAS cell line to visualize their expression levels in Taxol Drug
  Resistance breast cancer cells.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be labeled with their exact values?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (horizontal or vertical)?

  4. Should there be grid lines to help in visual comparison of the values?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to include a legend, even though there are only three
  Gene.symbols?

  6. Do you want a specific title for the chart?

  7. Is there a specific format for the axes labels or tick marks that you prefer?

  8. Would you like annotations or text boxes highlighting key findings or values?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart text elements (titles,
  labels, etc.)?

  10. Should we include error bars or confidence intervals if the data supports it?'
