initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the logFC of Gene.symbols across different
  Cell Lines. Highlight and annotate top significant genes with their P.Value. Focus
  on Taxol Drug Resistance in Breast Cancer.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How many top significant genes would you like to highlight?

  3. Do you prefer specific annotations styles for significant genes (e.g., bold text,
  different colors, specific markers)?

  4. Do you want to include a specific threshold for the P.Value to determine significance?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to display any specific ordering of cell lines or
  gene symbols?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scaling of the heatmap (e.g., log scale, linear
  scale)?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color intensities and annotations?

  8. Would you like to include any titles, subtitles, or labels on the axes for better
  clarity?

  9. Are there specific instructions for grouping or clustering similar cell lines
  or gene symbols?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please use a P.Value threshold of 0.05 to determine significance.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color intensities and annotations.

  8. Yes, please include titles, subtitles, and labels on the axes for better clarity.

  9. I am not sure.'
