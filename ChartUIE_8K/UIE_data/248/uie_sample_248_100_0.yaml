initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the gene expression data related
  to Taxol drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines. The x-axis should represent
  the gene symbols, and the y-axis should represent the log fold change (logFC) values.
  Highlight specific genes with the lowest P values to focus on significant changes.
  Include text annotations for these highlighted genes to emphasize their logFC and
  P values. The chart aims to help understand how different genes are expressed in
  various cell lines and how they might contribute to drug resistance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the genes with
  the lowest P values?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a title and axis labels? If so, could you
  provide the desired text for them?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. How many of the genes with the lowest P values would you like to be highlighted
  in the chart?

  5. Should the highlighted genes be marked with a specific symbol or shape on the
  chart?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be for
  the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the highlights and annotations?

  8. Is there a specific order in which the gene symbols should be displayed on the
  x-axis? For example, sorted by P values or alphabetically?

  9. Should the log fold change (logFC) values be represented using a specific scale,
  such as a logarithmic scale?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. Title: "Gene Expression Related
  to Taxol Resistance in Breast Cancer Cell Lines". X-axis label: "Gene Symbols".
  Y-axis label: "Log Fold Change (logFC)".

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Highlight the top 5 genes with the lowest P values.

  5. Yes, please use a star shape to mark the highlighted genes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, include a legend to explain the highlights and annotations.

  8. Display the gene symbols sorted by P values.

  9. I do not know.'
