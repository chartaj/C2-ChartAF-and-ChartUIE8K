initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing 'logFC' vs. 'P.Value' for the different
  'Gene.symbol' in breast cancer cell lines. Highlight significant genes with annotations
  for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for highlighting significant
  genes?

  2. Would you like the chart to display gridlines for easier reading of values?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations?

  4. Should the axes be logarithmically scaled, linearly scaled, or follow a different
  scaling method?

  5. Are there any specific thresholds for significance that you want to be used for
  highlighting the genes?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to indicate what the highlights and annotations
  represent?

  7. Do you have a preference for how the annotations should be positioned relative
  to the highlighted genes?

  8. Should the line chart connect all data points, or only specific gene sets?

  9. Would you like to add any reference lines or markers (e.g., average line, threshold
  line) on the chart?

  10. Are there any specific details or styles you prefer for the tooltips that may
  appear when hovering over data points?'
