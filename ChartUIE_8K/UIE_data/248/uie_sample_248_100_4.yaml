initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  the P.Value and logFC columns for different genes in the Taxol drug resistance cell
  lines in breast cancer dataset. Use different colors to represent each cell line
  (BAS, in this case) and label the points with their corresponding gene symbols.
  This will help us understand the distribution and significance of gene expression
  changes in relation to drug resistance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to represent
  different cell lines?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to specify which color corresponds to which
  cell line?

  3. Do you prefer any specific marker style (e.g., circle, square, triangle) for
  the scatter plot points?

  4. How would you like the axes to be labeled (including any specific formatting
  for ''P.Value'' and ''logFC'')?

  5. Are there any specific axis limits you would like to set for the ''P.Value''
  and ''logFC'' axes?

  6. Would you like to display grid lines on the scatter plot?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the gene symbol labels on the points?

  8. Should we implement any specific scaling method for the axes (e.g., logarithmic
  scale)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include a legend to specify which color corresponds to which cell
  line.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Label the axes as ''P.Value'' and ''logFC''.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please display grid lines on the scatter plot.

  7. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  8. I do not know.'
