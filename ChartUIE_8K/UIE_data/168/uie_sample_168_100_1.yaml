initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing "age" on the x-axis and "chol" (cholesterol)
  on the y-axis for the UCI Heart Disease Data. Add text annotations for any significant
  data points to highlight specific age groups with notable cholesterol values. Use
  highlights to emphasize trends and anomalies. The chart's purpose is to explore
  the relationship between age and cholesterol levels, providing insights for health
  researchers. Remember to visually differentiate data points by "sex" using separate
  colors or line styles. Include a legend and relevant axis titles for clarity. This
  visualization aims to identify age-related cholesterol trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors for differentiating
  sexes in the chart?

  2. Would you like specific age group ranges to be highlighted, and if so, which
  ranges are of particular interest?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Would you prefer the line styles for different sexes to be solid lines, dashed
  lines, or another style?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout or position of the legend?

  6. Are there specific trends or anomalies that you already expect and would like
  highlighted?

  7. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme or specific colors for differentiating
  sexes in the chart.

  2. I am not sure; I leave it up to your expertise to identify and highlight significant
  age group ranges.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size for the text annotations.

  4. I am not sure about the line styles; please choose what you think would be most
  effective.

  5. I do not know; place the legend where it would be most clear and aesthetically
  pleasing.

  6. I do not know of any specific trends or anomalies; please use your judgment to
  highlight important ones.

  7. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Age" and the y-axis as "Cholesterol (mg/dL)".

  8. I do not have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart.


  Thank you!'
