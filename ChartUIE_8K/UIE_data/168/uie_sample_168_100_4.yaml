initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot using the UCI Heart Disease dataset. On the
  x-axis, plot "age," and on the y-axis, plot "chol" (cholesterol levels). Differentiate
  the points by "sex" using different colors or markers. Additionally, use the "num"
  column to vary the size of the points, representing the severity of heart disease
  (0-4). This plot should help in visualizing the relationship between age, cholesterol
  levels, and heart disease severity across genders. Also, ensure to label the axes
  and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  "sex" variable in the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for representing different genders?

  3. What title would you like to display on the scatter plot?

  4. Do you want a grid to be displayed in the scatter plot background?

  5. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the range of values displayed on the x-axis (age)
  and y-axis (cholesterol levels)?

  7. Would you like to include specific annotations or highlights for any particular
  data points or ranges?

  8. Is there a specific order or placement you prefer for the legend on the scatter
  plot?

  9. Do you prefer a log scale for either the x-axis or y-axis?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I do not know, any standard marker shapes for genders are fine.

  3. "Age vs. Cholesterol Levels with Heart Disease Severity"

  4. Yes, I would like a grid in the scatter plot background.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference for the range of values on the axes.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference for the legend placement.

  9. No, I do not prefer a log scale for either axis.'
