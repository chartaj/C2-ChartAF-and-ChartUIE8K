initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the satisfaction levels of two products
  within a business context. Ensure the data points are plotted accurately, and use
  text annotations to display specific values tied to notable data points. Highlight
  a few key data points by changing their color or size to draw attention. This will
  help in making a comparative analysis of product satisfaction more focused and insightful
  for stakeholders. Include context-relevant annotations to provide additional insights
  or commentary on the data trends. The visualization should make it easy to understand
  differences in satisfaction between the two products.
