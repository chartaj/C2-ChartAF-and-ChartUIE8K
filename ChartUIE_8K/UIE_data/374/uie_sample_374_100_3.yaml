initial_prompt: Hi, I have a dataset with information about two different products
  and their respective satisfaction levels. This dataset includes a column for type
  (which product it is) and a column for value (the satisfaction score). Could you
  please create a bar chart that compares the satisfaction levels of these two products?
  I want to see a clear comparison of the average satisfaction scores for "product
  1" and "product 2". Make sure the chart is easy to understand and visually appealing.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels on each bar showing the average
  satisfaction score?

  3. Should the bar chart include a legend even though there are only two products?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  5. Would you like axis titles to be included on the chart, and if so, what should
  they be?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Would you like to display gridlines on the chart to aid in readability?

  9. Should each bar be a different color to distinguish between the two products,
  or should they be the same color with different shades?

  10. Do you want any annotations or markers on the chart to highlight specific data
  points or averages?'
