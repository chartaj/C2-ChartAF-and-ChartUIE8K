initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between life expectancy,
  socio-economic factors, and other health indicators for different countries. Highlight
  countries with extreme values in life expectancy, undernourishment, and health expenditure.
  Use text annotations to display key data points like life expectancy and undernourishment
  rates for specific countries. The visualization aims to provide insights into how
  various socio-economic factors impact life expectancy, especially in different regions
  and income groups. Ensure the heatmap is easy to interpret and emphasizes the most
  crucial data, making it practical for social science researchers to draw actionable
  conclusions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap distinguish between regions using different color shades or
  patterns?

  3. Do you prefer specific symbols for text annotations on the heatmap?

  4. Are there specific countries you want to ensure are individually highlighted
  with annotations?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  6. Should the extreme values be highlighted with specific colors or text formatting
  (e.g., bold, italics)?

  7. Would you like any specific legends or labels added to clarify the data presented
  in the heatmap?

  8. Is there a particular order or grouping of countries you prefer on the heatmap
  (e.g., by region or income group)?

  9. Are there any additional data points or indicators you would like to see included
  in the visualization?

  10. Should the heatmap have a specific title or subtitle for better context?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I want to ensure that countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy,
  as well as those with extreme undernourishment rates, are highlighted.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please highlight extreme values with specific colors or bold text.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful to clarify the data presented.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No, the current indicators are sufficient.

  10. Yes, please include a title like "Correlation Between Life Expectancy and Socio-Economic
  Factors by Country".'
