initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the average life expectancy
  and CO2 emissions for each region using the data from the CSV. Group the data by
  region and plot the average life expectancy on one axis and average CO2 emissions
  on the other. Make sure to label the regions and provide a clear legend. This will
  help us understand the correlation between life expectancy and CO2 emissions across
  different regions. Letâ€™s analyze the socio-economic impact on life expectancy and
  environmental factors. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed side by side or stacked?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be grouped within the regions
