initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize life expectancy, health expenditure,
  and education expenditure by country and income group over the years. Highlight
  differences across regions and income groups, and add data-driven text annotations
  for life expectancy and health expenditure to emphasize key insights. The chart
  should help identify socio-economic disparities and trends in public spending on
  health and education. Use color highlights to differentiate regions and income groups,
  and include corruption data as non-data-driven annotations to provide additional
  context. The purpose is to assess how socio-economic factors influence life expectancy
  and public expenditure.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred style for the color highlights to differentiate
  regions and income groups?

  2. How would you like the data-driven text annotations to be formatted for life
  expectancy and health expenditure?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding for regions and
  income groups?

  4. Is there a specific order you would like the countries or income groups to be
  displayed in?

  5. How should missing data points be handled in the visualization?

  6. Do you have any specific font or size preferences for the text annotations?

  7. Would you like to include any specific measures for highlighting socio-economic
  disparities, such as additional visual indicators?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the color coding for regions
  and income groups.

  4. I do not have a specific order in mind for the countries or income groups to
  be displayed in.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference for the font or size of the text annotations.
