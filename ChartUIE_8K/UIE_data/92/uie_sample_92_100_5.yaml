initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trends in "Life Expectancy World
  Bank" from 2001 onwards for different income groups (Low income, Lower middle income,
  Upper middle income) and regions (e.g., South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Europe &
  Central Asia). The x-axis should represent the years, while the y-axis should display
  the life expectancy values. Use different colors or line styles to differentiate
  between the income groups and regions. This visualization will help to compare how
  life expectancy has evolved over time across various socio-economic contexts.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme to be used in
  the chart?

  2. Would you like to use solid lines, dashed lines, or a combination to differentiate
  between the income groups and regions?

  3. Should there be specific markers (e.g., circles, squares) on the data points
  along the lines?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels (x-axis and y-axis)?

  5. Are there particular font styles or sizes you would like to be used for the text
  elements in the chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific placement for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be for
  both x and y axes, or just one?

  8. Should the chart have specific annotations or highlights for certain years or
  trends?

  9. Do you prefer a specific range for the y-axis, or should it adjust automatically
  based on the data?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or reference lines (e.g.,
  average life expectancy) on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. A combination of solid and dashed lines would be good.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Life Expectancy Trends (2001 onwards); x-axis: Year, y-axis: Life Expectancy

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for both x and y axes.

  8. No specific annotations or highlights needed.

  9. It should adjust automatically based on the data.
