  4. Do you prefer the axes of the radar chart to be fixed or auto-scaled based on
  the data range?

  5. Would you like any specific legends or titles to be included in the chart?

  6. Are there any particular data ranges or thresholds that you want to highlight
  in the chart?

  7. How should outliers be represented in the radar chart, if at all?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the order of the variables around the radar chart?'
