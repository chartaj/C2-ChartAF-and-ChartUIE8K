initial_prompt: I have a dataset on cardiovascular health with multiple variables
  like age, gender, chest pain, and more. I want to visualize the distribution and
  spread of a few key numeric variables to understand their variability and central
  tendency across different categories. Specifically, create a violin plot for the
  'age' variable segmented by 'gender,' 'chestpain,' and 'target.' This will help
  me analyze the spread and median age in different patient groups. Ensure that the
  plot allows comparison between these categories clearly. This can offer insights
  into how age distribution varies across different conditions and outcomes in heart
  disease.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette or theme preference for the chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the ''gender,'' ''chestpain,'' and ''target''
  categories in the chart?

  3. Should the chart include specific axis labels or titles?

  4. Would you like individual data points to be displayed in the violin plot?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to distinguish between categories?

  6. Should the chart have grid lines to enhance readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) overlay on
  the violin plots?

  9. Do you want any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key observations?

  10. Should the chart include confidence intervals or any other statistical indicators?'
