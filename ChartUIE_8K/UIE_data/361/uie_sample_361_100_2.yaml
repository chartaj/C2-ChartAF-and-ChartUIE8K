initial_prompt: Create a dumbbell chart to compare the resting blood pressure (restingBP)
  and max heart rate (maxheartrate) of patients versus their age. Use two different
  colors to highlight the difference between these values. Annotate specific data
  points like the highest and lowest heart rates and blood pressures to draw attention
  to critical cardiovascular health data. This visualization will help in understanding
  how age and other factors affect heart health parameters among the patients in this
  cardiovascular disease dataset. Focus on clear and concise annotations to make the
  chart easily interpretable for health professionals.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting the resting
  blood pressure and max heart rate differences?

  2. How would you like the annotated data points for the highest and lowest heart
  rates and blood pressures to be highlighted (e.g., bold, different colors, arrows)?

  3. Do you want any particular font style or size for the annotations?

  4. Would you like to display any specific labels or legends on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific axis scales or ranges you prefer for the age, resting
  blood pressure, and max heart rate?

  6. Do you have any preference for the chart''s background color or theme?

  7. Should the resting blood pressure and max heart rate be plotted as lines or markers?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability, especially for age,
  resting blood pressure, and max heart rate values?'
