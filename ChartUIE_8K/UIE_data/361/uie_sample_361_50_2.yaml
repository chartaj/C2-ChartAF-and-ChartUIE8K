initial_prompt: 'Visualize the cardiovascular disease dataset using a dumbbell chart
  highlighting age and max heartrate, annotated for top and lowest values. Purpose:
  To compare the heart rate response across different ages.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the dumbbell chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the age and max heartrate annotations?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for easier comparison?

  4. Should the chart display units (such as bpm for heartrate) on the axes?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the annotations?

  6. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Would you like to see any additional statistical measures, such as mean or median
  heartrate values for different age groups?

  8. Are there any specific age ranges or heartrate values you would like to emphasize
  further?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific color scheme in mind.

  "Comparison of Maximum Heartrate by Age"

  7. I am not sure about additional statistical measures.
