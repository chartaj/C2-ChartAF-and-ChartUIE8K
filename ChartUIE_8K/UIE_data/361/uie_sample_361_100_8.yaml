initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart that visualizes the distribution of chest
  pain types among different age groups and their associated targets (condition presence
  or absence). Please use the 'age', 'chestpain', and 'target' columns from the cardiovascular
  disease dataset. The y-axis should represent counts, the x-axis should represent
  different age groups, and the bars should be stacked by chest pain types with different
  colors representing the target condition. This will help us understand the correlation
  between age, chest pain types, and the presence of cardiovascular disease.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for differentiating the
  target conditions and chest pain types?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be divided (e.g., in decades)?

  3. Is there any specific order in which you want the chest pain types to be stacked
  in the bars?

  4. Would you like to include labels or annotations on the bars to show the counts
  or percentages?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend, and if so, where would you like it
  to be positioned (e.g., right, bottom)?

  6. Are there any specific titles or axis labels you would like to use for the chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font style and size used in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, in decades would be good.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include labels to show the counts.

  5. Yes, I prefer the legend to be positioned at the bottom.

  6. No specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
