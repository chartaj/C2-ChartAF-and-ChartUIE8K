initial_prompt: I have a dataset about cardiovascular disease and I need a bar chart
  visualizing the data. Specifically, I want to see the frequency of different chest
  pain types among patients, categorized by gender. The x-axis should represent the
  chest pain types (from 0 to 3), and the y-axis should show the number of patients.
  We should have separate bars for male and female patients within each chest pain
  type category to compare the prevalence between genders. Please ensure the chart
  is easy to understand and accurately reflects the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between male
  and female patients?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to specify which colors represent male and
  female patients?

  3. Do you prefer the bars for male and female patients to be grouped or stacked
  within each chest pain type category?

  4. Would you like to add data labels on the bars showing the exact number of patients?

  5. Should there be any specific title for the chart?

  6. Do you want to include labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they
  be?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart (titles,
  labels, annotations)?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  9. Do you need any annotations or additional notes on the chart to highlight key
  findings?'
