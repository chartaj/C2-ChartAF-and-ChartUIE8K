initial_prompt: Could you please create an area chart showing the popularity of different
  names over time for females? The data should be grouped by year, and the proportion
  (prop) should be used as the metric for the area representation. This will help
  visualize the trends and changes in name popularity from 1880 onwards. Specifically,
  focus on the names 'Helen,' 'Amanda,' and 'Betty' as seen in the sample data. The
  area chart should accurately reflect any peaks or declines in name usage over the
  years. This will be useful for understanding historical naming trends. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart?

  2. Would you like each name to have a distinct color or shade?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify the different names?

  4. Are there any specific labeling preferences for the x-axis (time) and y-axis
  (proportion)?

  5. Should we include gridlines to enhance readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, etc.)?

  7. Would you like to display data points on the chart for specific years or only
  show the area fill?

  8. Are there any specific annotations you would like to add to highlight key trends
  or events?

  9. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?'
