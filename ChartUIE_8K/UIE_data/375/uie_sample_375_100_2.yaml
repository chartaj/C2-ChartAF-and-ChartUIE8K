initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize each person's income over time in
  the business sector. Use text annotations to display specific income values at key
  points on the lines, drawing attention to noteworthy changes or trends. Incorporate
  highlights to distinguish significant peaks or dips in the data, helping to emphasize
  their importance visually. This will allow us to better understand individual income
  trajectories and identify patterns or anomalies in the data. The visual should aid
  in making informed business decisions based on historical income trends.
