initial_prompt: Can you create a histogram showing the distribution of the number
  of people (n) for each unique name from the dataset? Include separate histograms
  for each year, showing trends over time. Use years and names as categories on the
  x-axis and the number of occurrences (n) on the y-axis. The overall aim is to visualize
  how the popularity of names changes over the years. Additionally, make sure the
  different years are color-coded to distinguish between them easily. This will help
  us understand historical trends in name popularity and their distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to distinguish
  different years in the histogram?

  2. Do you prefer the histograms for each year to be displayed in a single chart
  or in separate charts for each year?

  3. Would you like the axes to have specific labels or formatting (e.g., font size,
  font type)?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the bin size or range for the histograms?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines or any additional annotations for better
  readability?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the names or years to be displayed
  on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles on the chart for better
  context?'
