initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the yearly income of individuals
  from the business sector. Specifically, I want to see a comparison of incomes over
  the years, segmented by sex and name. The columns should represent income amounts,
  and the years should be on the x-axis. Ensure that the chart shows the proportion
  of income by name for each year, highlighting any disparities or trends. Include
  a legend to differentiate between sexes and use different colors for each name for
  better clarity. The chart should help us understand income variations over time.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the names in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the columns to display the exact income
  values?

  3. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  4. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart titles,
  axis labels, or legends?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be shown on the chart? If so, do you prefer them to
  be major, minor, or both?

  6. Would you like to see any trend lines or other statistical markers included on
  the chart to emphasize certain patterns?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the axis intervals (e.g., yearly, biennially)?

  9. Should the axis labels be rotated for better readability?

  10. Do you prefer a certain layout for the chart, such as a grouped column chart
  or a stacked column chart?'
