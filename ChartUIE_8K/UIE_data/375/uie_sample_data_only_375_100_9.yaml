02_initial_prompt: Could you please create an area chart showing the popularity of
  different names over time for females? The data should be grouped by year, and the
  proportion (prop) should be used as the metric for the area representation. This
  will help visualize the trends and changes in name popularity from 1880 onwards.
  Specifically, focus on the names 'Helen,' 'Amanda,' and 'Betty' as seen in the sample
  data. The area chart should accurately reflect any peaks or declines in name usage
  over the years. This will be useful for understanding historical naming trends.
