initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the distribution of names over the
  years. Use the 'year' column for the x-axis and the sum of the 'n' column for each
  name per year on the y-axis. Separate the data by 'sex' using different colors.
  Ensure the chart is easily readable with appropriate labels and a legend to distinguish
  the sexes. This will help visualize how the popularity of each name changes over
  time and how it differs between male and female.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors representing male
  and female?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to have specific intervals (e.g., every 5 years, every
  decade)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or font for the labels on the axes?

  4. Should the y-axis be displayed with specific increments or a logarithmic scale?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Where would you prefer the legend to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or callouts on the chart to highlight
  specific trends or years?

  8. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so, horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  9. Should the chart include a background color or pattern?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Every decade would be good.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. "Popularity of Names Over Time by Gender" would be a suitable title.

  6. Right side would be preferred.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Both horizontal and vertical gridlines would be helpful.

  9. I am not sure.'
