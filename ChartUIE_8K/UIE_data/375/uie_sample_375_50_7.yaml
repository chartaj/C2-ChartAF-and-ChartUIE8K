initial_prompt: Please create an area chart to visualize the varying populations of
  different names over the years, broken down by sex. Ensure the x-axis represents
  the years and the y-axis shows the population size.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the sexes (e.g., specific
  colors for male and female)?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reading of values?

  3. Should the chart include data labels showing the population size directly on
  the areas?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Should there be a legend indicating the names and their corresponding areas?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific name or names within the chart?

  7. Is there a need to apply any smoothing to the area lines to make the trends clearer?

  8. Should the x-axis be divided into specific intervals (e.g., every 5 years, every
  10 years)?

  9. Do you want to include annotations or callouts for significant trends or points
  in the data?

  10. Is there a specific order in which the names should be displayed (e.g., ascending/descending
  by population size, alphabetical)?

  11. Would you prefer a stacked area chart to show cumulative populations or individual
  areas for each name?

  12. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the chart (e.g., landscape or
  portrait)?'
