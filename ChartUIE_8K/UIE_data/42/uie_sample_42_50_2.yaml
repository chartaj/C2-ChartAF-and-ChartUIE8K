initial_prompt: <start of the annotation list> Create a treemap to visualize urine
  analysis data for kidney stone prediction. Highlight target categories and use text
  annotations for gravity, ph, and urea values to emphasize critical elements. <end
  of the annotation list>
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different categories
  in the treemap?

  2. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations on gravity,
  ph, and urea values?

  3. Should the categories be ordered in a particular way, such as by size, value,
  or alphabetically?

  4. Do you want to include a legend that explains the color scheme used in the treemap?

  5. Are there any particular thresholds or cut-offs for the gravity, ph, and urea
  values that should be visually emphasized?

  6. Would you like any additional metrics or values included as part of the text
  annotations in the treemap?

  7. How would you like to handle overlapping text annotations to ensure readability?

  8. Should the chart include any additional labeling or identification for the target
  categories?'
