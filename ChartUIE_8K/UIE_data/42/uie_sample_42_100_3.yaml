initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the Kidney Stone Prediction data
  based on urine analysis. Could you please plot 'gravity' on the x-axis and 'ph'
  on the y-axis? Use different colors to distinguish the 'target' categories (0 and
  1) and include a legend to specify the target values. Also, ensure that the axes
  are labeled correctly for easy understanding. This visualization will help in identifying
  any correlations or patterns between urine gravity, pH levels, and the likelihood
  of kidney stones. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  the ''target'' categories?

  2. Would you like to set specific axis limits for ''gravity'' and ''ph''?

  3. Do you have a preference for the point shapes or sizes on the scatter plot?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Should any additional annotations or reference lines be added to highlight key
  insights?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure about setting specific axis limits.

  3. I donâ€™t have a preference for the point shapes or sizes.

  4. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  5. I do not know about additional annotations or reference lines.

  6. I have no specific preference for the title.'
