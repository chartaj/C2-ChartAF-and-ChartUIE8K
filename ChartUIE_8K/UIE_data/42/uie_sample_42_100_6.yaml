initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap visualization for the data set on kidney
  stone prediction based on urine analysis. The heatmap should display the correlation
  between the different features: gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, and calc, including
  the target variable. This will help us understand the relationships and how these
  variables are interrelated. Make sure that the color gradient clearly differentiates
  between strong positive, strong negative, and weak correlations. Additionally, ensure
  that all the column names are displayed clearly on both axes for easy interpretation.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Are there any specific colors you want to use for strong positive, strong negative,
  and weak correlations?

  3. What font size and style would you prefer for the axis labels?

  4. Do you want grid lines to separate the cells in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to add annotations displaying the correlation values within each
  cell?

  6. Is there a specific ordering of attributes you prefer on the axes?

  7. Do you have any preferred layout dimensions (width and height) for the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific themes or design aesthetics you want to follow?

  9. Do you need a legend explaining the color gradient on the heatmap?

  10. Would you like any additional information or notes included in the visualization?'
