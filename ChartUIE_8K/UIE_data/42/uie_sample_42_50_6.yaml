initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the kidney stone prediction data. Show
  correlations between urine properties (gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, calc) and
  the target variable.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each grid cell to show the correlation values?

  3. Should we use a specific color gradient (e.g., blue to red) to indicate correlation
  strength?

  4. Do you require a title and/or subtitle for the heatmap? If so, what should they
  be?

  5. Would you like to include axis labels? If yes, do you have specific labels in
  mind?

  6. Should we include a color bar/legend to interpret the correlation values?

  7. How would you like the data to be scaled or normalized, if at all?

  8. Is there a particular range of correlation values you would like to highlight
  or focus on?

  9. Would you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text in the heatmap?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. Yes, please include labels for each grid cell to show the correlation values.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, title: "Correlation Heatmap of Urine Properties in Kidney Stone Prediction".

  5. Yes, X-axis: "Urine Properties", Y-axis: "Target Variable".

  6. Yes, please include a color bar/legend.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I am not sure.
