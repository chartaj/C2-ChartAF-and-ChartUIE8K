initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for each column in the kidney stone prediction
  dataset. Focus on visualizing the distribution of gravity, ph, osmo, cond, urea,
  and calc values to understand their ranges and identify any patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histograms?

  2. Should the histograms have a specific color scheme or use default colors?

  3. Do you want labels for the x-axis and y-axis on each histogram?

  4. Should the histograms include a title specific to each data attribute?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the histograms?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the font size or style for labels and titles?

  7. Should the histograms display the counts or frequencies on the y-axis?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included if multiple data series are shown in a
  single histogram?

  9. Do you have any preference on the range limits for the x-axis or y-axis for each
  histogram?'
