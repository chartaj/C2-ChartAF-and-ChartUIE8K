initial_prompt: Create a box chart for a kidney stone prediction based on urine analysis
  data. Include gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, and calc across all samples. Highlight
  variations and outliers in each parameter.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting variations
  and outliers?

  2. Would you like to label the outliers explicitly?

  3. Should the box chart include median lines or mean indicators?

  4. Is there a particular order in which you would like the parameters to be displayed
  on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific scale or units for the y-axis for each parameter?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or text descriptions to the chart?

  7. Should the chart include a title and axis labels, and if so, what should they
  be?

  8. Are there any specific value ranges you would like to focus on or highlight for
  each parameter?

  9. Would you like grid lines to improve readability?

  10. Should there be any background shading or reference lines for better context?'
