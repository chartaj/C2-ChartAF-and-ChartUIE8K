initial_prompt: Please create a box plot for each feature (gravity, ph, osmo, cond,
  urea, calc) from the provided kidney stone prediction dataset. Each box plot should
  show the distribution of the values across the dataset. Since "target" has two unique
  values, separate the data into two categories (0 and 1), and create a grouped box
  plot for each feature based on this categorization. This will help in visualizing
  the differences in urine properties between those with and without kidney stones.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box plots?

  2. Would you like the box plots to display individual data points (e.g., using jitter)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the features (gravity, ph, osmo, cond, urea,
  calc) on the chart?

  4. Should the y-axis be on a logarithmic scale for any of the features?

  5. Do you want to include mean markers in addition to the median line within the
  box plots?

  6. Are there specific labels or titles you would like for each axis and overall
  chart?

  7. Should the plot include any specific statistical annotations or overlays (e.g.,
  p-values, quartile ranges)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the categories (0
  and 1) of the "target" variable?

  9. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text in the charts?

  10. Would you like gridlines to be present in the background of the box plots?

  11. Should there be any special formatting for the outliers in the box plots?

  12. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?'
