initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the distribution and relationships between
  different urine analysis metrics such as gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, and calc
  for kidney stone prediction. Highlight elements with unique values to emphasize
  their variance. Use text annotations to display key values like gravity or pH next
  to the larger sections. Ensure the color intensity varies with the osmo and urea
  levels to indicate concentration and health risks. The practical purpose is to provide
  a visual tool for quick assessment of urine sample properties in predicting kidney
  stone risk.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for indicating different levels
  of osmo and urea concentration?

  2. Are there specific color codes you would like us to use for highlighting unique
  values?

  3. Do you prefer specific font styles or sizes for text annotations displaying key
  values like gravity or pH?

  4. Would you like any specific hierarchical structure for the treemap sections,
  such as grouping by certain urine metrics?

  5. Do you have preferences regarding the layout, such as the aspect ratio or padding
  between sections of the treemap?

  6. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to be included to enhance
  readability and interpretation?

  7. Should certain metrics be prioritized or emphasized in the visualization?'
