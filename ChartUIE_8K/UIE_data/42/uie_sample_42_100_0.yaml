initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the urine analysis data for kidney
  stone prediction. Highlight key metrics like gravity, pH, osmo, cond, urea, and
  calc across samples. Include annotations to emphasize specific data values, making
  it easier to identify patterns or abnormalities. Use a color scheme to differentiate
  between the metrics, and ensure the target column is represented distinctly to show
  the prediction outcomesâ€”whether a sample is predicted to lead to kidney stones or
  not. This visualization aims to easily spot critical variations in urine properties
  related to kidney stone formation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to differentiate
  between the metrics?

  2. Is there a particular layout or ordering for the bars that you prefer (e.g.,
  by sample number, by metric type)?

  3. What type of annotations would you prefer to emphasize specific data values (e.g.,
  text labels, arrows, highlights)?

  4. Do you want to include any specific thresholds or reference lines for certain
  metrics?

  5. Should the target column be represented in a specific way (e.g., different color
  bars, separate section)?

  6. Is there a preference for how you want patterns or abnormalities to be displayed
  (e.g., color encodings, symbols)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to help interpret the different color encodings
  and annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Ordered by sample number would be fine.

  3. Text labels would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Different color bars for the target column would be great.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.'
