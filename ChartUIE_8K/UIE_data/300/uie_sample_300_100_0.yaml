initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of "Raw TOC (mg/l)"
  and "Finish TOC (mg/l)" values. Use text annotations for notable data points, highlighting
  trends or outliers. Annotate specific elements like outliers to focus viewer attention
  before diving deeper. Highlight important elements in the chart for emphasis. The
  dataset seems concerned with environmental science, specifically organic and dissolved
  organic carbon, so aim to reveal any noticeable patterns or compliance issues. Provide
  context and editorial comments to help interpret the data. The ultimate goal is
  to make the data's story clear and insightful.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. What style of text annotations do you prefer for notable data points (e.g., font
  size, color, background)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences on how to highlight outliers (e.g., circle
  them, different color)?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the histogram for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer a specific title format for the chart?

  6. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include units of measurement?

  7. How would you like the context and editorial comments displayed (e.g., side notes,
  within the chart area)?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds or reference lines you want included for indicating
  compliance levels?

  9. Would you like a legend to differentiate between "Raw TOC (mg/l)" and "Finish
  TOC (mg/l)" values?

  10. Is there a specific format or design for the annotations to help interpret the
  data more clearly?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer annotations in a legible, medium-sized font with a contrasting color,
  such as black text on a light background.

  3. I think circling the outliers in a bright color, like red, would be helpful.

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines included for better readability.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, the x-axis and y-axis labels should include units of measurement.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include reference lines for any known compliance thresholds.

  9. Yes, a legend would be useful to differentiate between "Raw TOC (mg/l)" and "Finish
  TOC (mg/l)" values.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
