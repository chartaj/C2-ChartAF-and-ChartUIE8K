initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the provided data on Organic Carbon
  and Dissolved Organic Carbon. Focus on visualizing the relationships between 'Raw
  TOC (mg/l)', 'Finish TOC (mg/l)', 'Raw DOC (mg/l)', 'Fin DOC (mg/l)', 'Raw UV254
  (cm-1)', and 'Raw SUVA (l/mg-m)'. Highlight any significant patterns or correlations.
  The heatmap should help identify trends in these measurements over time. Ensure
  that missing values are well-handled in the visualization. This will help in understanding
  the data better for environmental science applications and compliance tracking.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include annotations to show exact values within the cells?

  3. Do you want to apply any specific method for handling missing values?

  4. Are there specific labels or titles you want for the axes and overall heatmap?

  5. Do you prefer a particular scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for the heatmap''s
  color intensity?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color gradient for the heatmap?

  7. Should we normalize the data before plotting the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific statistical thresholds or significance levels to highlight
  correlations?

  9. Would you like gridlines to be displayed within the heatmap?

  10. Should the heatmap include a date/time breakdown along one axis to better visualize
  trends over time?'
