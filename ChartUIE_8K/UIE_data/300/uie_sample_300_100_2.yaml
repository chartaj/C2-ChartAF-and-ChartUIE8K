initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the data on "TOC ReductionPCT
  (%)" across different dates. Annotate specific data points showing the highest and
  lowest values for "TOC ReductionPCT (%)" to emphasize significant variations. Additionally,
  use highlights to mark the compliance percentage as per "IDEM Requirement (%)" for
