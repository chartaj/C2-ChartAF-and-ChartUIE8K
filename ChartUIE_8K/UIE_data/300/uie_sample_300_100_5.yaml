initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon
  measurements in water samples. I need a scatter plot to visualize the relationship
  between 'Raw TOC (mg/l)' on the x-axis and 'Finish TOC (mg/l)' on the y-axis. Ensure
  to label the axes appropriately and indicate the unit of measurement. Include a
  title that reflects the data context. Also, highlight points where TOC ReductionPCT
  (%) is above the IDEM Requirement (%), maybe using a different color or marker.
  This will help to easily identify compliant instances.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the scatter plot?

  3. How would you prefer to highlight the points where ''TOC ReductionPCT (%)'' is
  above ''IDEM Requirement (%)''? Would you prefer a different color or a different
  marker shape?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axes labels, title,
  or legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred format for the title of the chart? For example, including
  specific keywords or structure.

  6. Would you like to add data labels directly on the points, especially the highlighted
  ones indicating compliance?

  7. Is there any specific information or annotations you would like to appear within
  the chart area or on the axes?

  8. Do you require a legend to explain the different markers or colors used in the
  plot?

  9. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio that you prefer for the scatter plot?'
