initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the provided data that shows changes
  over time for "Raw TOC (mg/l)", "Finish TOC (mg/l)", "Raw DOC (mg/l)", and "Fin
  DOC (mg/l)" values. Make sure the x-axis represents the "DATE" and the y-axis represents
  the concentration levels. Highlight the differences between the raw and finished
  measurements for both TOC and DOC. This will help visualize the reduction of organic
  carbon in the process. Include markers for missing data points to indicate gaps.
  The title should be "TOC and DOC Concentration Changes Over Time".
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the lines representing
  each variable?

  2. Should specific line styles (such as dashed or dotted lines) be used to differentiate
  between raw and finished measurements?

  3. Do you want any particular markers to represent missing data points, such as
  circles, squares, or crosses?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Should gridlines be included in the chart for easier reading of the values, and
  if so, in which direction (horizontal, vertical, or both)?

  7. Do you want to add any annotations or notes to highlight specific data points
  or events within the timeline?

  8. Are there any preferred ranges or specific scaling for the y-axis to better highlight
  the differences in concentration levels?

  9. Should the x-axis labels be formatted in a specific way (e.g., month/year, or
  full date)?

  10. Would you prefer any smoothing or interpolation for the lines to handle missing
  data points, or should they be indicated explicitly with gaps?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, as long as it''s clear.

  2. I do not know, maybe you can decide what looks best.

  3. Circles would be fine for missing data points.

  4. I have no specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed; you can
  choose the best place.

  6. Yes, include gridlines in both directions for easier reading.

  7. I do not know about annotations; you can add if you think it''s necessary.

  8. I have no specific preference for the y-axis scaling.

  9. Full date for the x-axis labels would be good.

  10. Explicit gaps for missing data points would be preferred.'
