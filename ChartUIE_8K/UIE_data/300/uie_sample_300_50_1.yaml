initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the percentage composition of missing
  values in each column. Highlight columns with high missing values in red and annotate
  their percentages to draw attention. This helps focus on data quality for environmental
  science analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you would like to use for the segments
  other than red for high missing values?

  2. What threshold percentage do you consider as ''high missing values'' to be highlighted
  in red?

  3. Do you prefer specific fonts or sizes for the annotations?

  4. Would you like a legend to be included in the pie chart?

  5. Are there any specific columns that should always appear in the chart despite
  their missing values percentage?

  6. Do you want a title or subtitle on the chart? If yes, please specify the text.

  7. Should the chart have any specific labels for the segments other than percentages?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the columns to be displayed
  in the pie chart (e.g., descending order of missing values)?

  9. Do you have preferences for the chartâ€™s aspect ratio or dimensions?

  10. Should the chart include a source or footnote? If yes, please provide the text.'
