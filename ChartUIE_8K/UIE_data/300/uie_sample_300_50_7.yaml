  green to yellow)?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to indicate the color range and corresponding
  TOC values?

  7. Should the heatmap include a title or any additional descriptive text?

  thresholds or dates?

  10. Do you have a specific size preference for the heatmap (e.g., dimensions or
