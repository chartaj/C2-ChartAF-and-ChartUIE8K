initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart for me that visualizes the average percentages
  of TOC ReductionPCT and IDEM Requirement for each quarter from the given data. I
  would like the chart to emphasize these specific data points by using distinct colors
  and adding text annotations for clarity. This visualization aims to make it easy
  to compare how well the TOC reduction meets IDEM requirements across different quarters.
  Please ensure the annotations describe each segment of the pie chart appropriately
  for a quick understanding of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you would like
  to use to distinguish between TOC ReductionPCT and IDEM Requirement?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to appear? Should they include percentage
  values, labels, or any additional information?

  3. Do you have a preference for the placement of the text annotations (e.g., inside
  the slices, outside with lines pointing to slices)?

  4. Should the pie chart have a legend, or do you prefer to rely solely on text annotations
  for clarity?

  5. Would you like any additional details or explanations included in the chart''s
  title or subtitles?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?'

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I would like the chart''s title to mention that it compares TOC ReductionPCT
  against IDEM Requirement for each quarter.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for font styles or sizes.'
