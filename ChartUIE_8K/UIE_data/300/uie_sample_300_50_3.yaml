initial_prompt: Generate a line chart showing 'DATE' on the x-axis and 'Raw TOC (mg/l)',
  'Finish TOC (mg/l)', and 'Raw DOC (mg/l)' on the y-axis to visualize trends in Organic
  Carbon levels over time.

  do you prefer?

  5. Are there any specific labels you would like for the x-axis and y-axis, or should
  we use the default labels based on the data attributes?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to the chart? If so, do you have a preference
  for its position?

  7. Is displaying grid-lines on the chart necessary for your analysis? If yes, on
  which axis (x, y, or both)?

  8. Do you prefer to have annotations or reference lines on the chart to highlight
  specific dates or values?

  9. Is there a date range you would like to focus on for the x-axis, or should we
