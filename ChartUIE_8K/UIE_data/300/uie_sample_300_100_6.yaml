initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize the summary of TOC and DOC metrics
  from the provided data. Use axes for Raw TOC (mg/l), Finish TOC (mg/l), Raw DOC
  (mg/l), Fin DOC (mg/l), Raw UV254 (cm-1), Raw SUVA (l/mg-m), TOC ReductionPCT (%),
  IDEM Requirement (%), Quarterly Average (%), and Running Annual Average Compliance
  (%). Highlight areas with missing data to indicate gaps. This chart should help
  understand the environmental health as reflected by organic carbon measures and
  ensure compliance with IDEM requirements. Add labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred axis ranges for the radar chart?

  2. Do you want specific colors assigned to each axis or data series?

  3. Should particular segments of the chart (e.g., those indicating IDEM requirements)
  be highlighted or annotated?

  4. How would you like the missing data to be visually represented on the chart (e.g.,
  with different colors, dashed lines, or gaps)?

  5. Are there any specific label formats or additional annotations you prefer for
  readability?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned?

  7. Do you have specific font preferences for the labels and titles?

  8. Is there any accompanying text or additional context you would like to be included
  on the chart?

  9. Should the chart be designed with a particular background color or theme to enhance
  its clarity and visual appeal?'
