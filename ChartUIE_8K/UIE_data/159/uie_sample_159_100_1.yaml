initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize the Forbes Richest People Dataset,
  focusing on net worth across different ages. Please annotate significant outliers
  like Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault, highlighting their net worth with
  text annotations. Use different colors to differentiate industries such as Automotive,
  Technology, and Fashion & Retail. Emphasize these three individuals by making their
  data points larger and using bright colors. Additionally, include text descriptions
  about their sources of wealth and industry to provide context. The goal is to explore
  wealth distribution among the richest individuals.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to differentiate
  industries?

  2. Would you like any specific symbols or shapes to be used for the dot plot points?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be displayed for significant outliers
  (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text descriptions
  about their sources of wealth and industry?

  5. Do you have any layout preferences for the chart, such as aspect ratio or margins?

  6. Would you like a legend included to explain the colors and symbols used for different
  industries?

  7. Are there any other individuals or data points you would like to emphasize in
  addition to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault?

  8. Should the data points be labeled with names directly on the chart or included
  in a side legend?'
answers: '1. I''m not sure, any standard contrasting color scheme would be fine.

  2. I do not know, standard dot shapes should be okay.

  3. I am not sure, whatever makes them clearly visible.

  4. I am not sure, whatever is standard and readable.

  5. I have no specific preference for the layout.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. No, just focus on Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Bernard Arnault.

  8. The names should be directly on the chart for better context.'
