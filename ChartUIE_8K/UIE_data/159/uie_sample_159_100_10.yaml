initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the wealth distribution and characteristics
  of the top billionaires from the Forbes Richest People dataset. The heatmap should
  include factors like Rank, Net Worth, Age, Country, Source, and Industry. I want
  to see how these attributes correlate, especially focusing on Net Worth and Age
  across different countries and industries. Use color gradients to denote values,
  missing data can be highlighted or ignored. Ensure the heatmap is easy to interpret,
  with appropriate legends and labels for clarity. This will help understand wealth
  patterns globally.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap to denote values?

  2. Should missing data be highlighted or ignored in the visualization?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the legends and labels (e.g., font size,
  positioning)?

  4. Do you want any specific annotation or highlighting on particular countries or
  industries?

  5. How would you like to handle the categories that have a large number of unique
  values (e.g., ''Source'', ''Industry'')?

  6. Are there any specific countries or industries you want to be emphasized in the
  heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color gradient; please choose one that is clear
  and easy to interpret.

  2. Missing data should be highlighted.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for the legends and labels.

  4. I do not know; highlighting major countries or industries could be useful.

  5. I am not sure; please use a method that provides clarity and ease of interpretation.

  6. I do not know; prominent countries or industries in the dataset might be useful
  to emphasize.'
