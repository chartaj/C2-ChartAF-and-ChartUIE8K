initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the Forbes Richest People dataset.
  I want the x-axis to represent the Age of the individuals, divided into appropriate
  age intervals, and the y-axis to show the count of individuals in each age group.
  The chart should help visualize the distribution of ages among the world's richest
  people. Make sure to highlight any missing values in the age data and how they are
  handled in the visualization. Additionally, a secondary observation of interest
  would be to see any significant outliers or trends in the age distribution.
questions: '1. What specific age intervals would you like to use for the histogram?

  2. Are there any specific colors you would prefer for the bars in the histogram?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be highlighted or annotated in the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the colors or markers to distinguish outliers?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have a specific title or label text you would like for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and title?

  8. Would you like to display any specific descriptive statistics (e.g., mean age,
  median age) on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure. Please suggest based on standard practice.

  2. I do not know. Any color that represents the data clearly is fine.

  3. Please highlight missing values with a distinct color or annotation, I am not
  sure which one would be best.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for colors or markers for outliers.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  6. For the x-axis: "Age of Individuals", and for the y-axis: "Count of Individuals".
  The title can be "Age Distribution of Forbes Richest People".

  7. I am not sure about the font style or size, whatever is standard should work.

  8. Yes, displaying the mean age and median age on the chart would be helpful.'
