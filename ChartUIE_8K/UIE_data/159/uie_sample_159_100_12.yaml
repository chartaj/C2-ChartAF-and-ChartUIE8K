initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot using the "Exploring Wealth: Forbes Richest
  People Dataset". Plot "Age" on the x-axis and "Net Worth" on the y-axis. Differentiate
  the points by "Country" using different colors. Include trend lines to show the
  distribution of wealth across different ages. Use tooltips to display additional
  information such as "Name", "Source", and "Industry" when hovering over the points.
  Ensure the axes are labeled clearly, and the chart title should indicate that it
  visualizes the age vs. net worth distribution of the wealthiest individuals.'
