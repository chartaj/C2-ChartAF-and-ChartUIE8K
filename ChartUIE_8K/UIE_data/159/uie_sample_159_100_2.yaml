initial_prompt: Create a column chart visualizing the top 10 richest people from the
  Forbes dataset. Highlight the columns based on 'Net Worth' to distinguish the top
  three individuals. Add text annotations for the names and net worth values of these
  top three. Use color highlights to differentiate the 'Industry' they belong to,
  for example, use different colors for 'Technology', 'Automotive', and 'Fashion &
