initial_prompt: I need a box plot to compare the distribution of Molecular Weights
  and Residue Weights of amino acids. It should show the range, median, and any outliers
  for both Molecular Weight and Residue Weight. Each box in the box plot should represent
  an amino acid's weights. The x-axis should have the amino acid names (Abbr), and
  the y-axis should represent the weights. Additionally, different colors should be
  used for Molecular Weight and Residue Weight to distinguish between them. Please
  use the data provided in the CSV file.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the colors to represent Molecular
  Weight and Residue Weight?

  2. Do you prefer a specific order for the amino acids (Abbr) on the x-axis, such
  as alphabetical order or based on a specific property?

  3. Would you like to include any additional statistical information, such as quartiles,
  on the plot?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or theme for the box plot (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  scientific)?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Are there any specific outlier representation preferences you have, such as specific
  marker shapes or sizes?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines on the plot for better readability?

  8. Do you have any specific size requirements for the chart (e.g., aspect ratio
  or dimensions)?'
