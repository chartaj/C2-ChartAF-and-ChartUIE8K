initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Molecular
  Weight and Residue Weight for various amino acids. Use different colors to represent
  unique amino acids, referencing properties like pKa1 and pKb2 for detailed analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the different amino
  acids?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to identify each amino acid name by color?

  3. Are there specific axis labels or titles you would like for the x and y axes?

  4. Do you want to include grid lines or prefer a clean background for the scatter
  plot?

  5. Would you prefer displaying data points with varying shapes or just colors to
  differentiate amino acids?

  6. Would you like any annotations or data labels on the chart to highlight specific
  amino acids or data values?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or limits you would like to set for the x-axis
  (Molecular Weight) and y-axis (Residue Weight)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the chart labels and
  titles?

  9. Would you like the plot to include reference lines or markers for pKa1 and pKb2
  values?'
