initial_prompt: Create a box chart showcasing the range and distribution of pKa1,
  pKb2, pKx3, and pl4 values for each amino acid. Ensure each amino acid is clearly
  labeled and differentiated by color.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between amino
  acids?

  2. How would you like the labels for each amino acid to be displayed (e.g., abbreviations,
  full names, or single-letter codes)?

  3. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the box chart?

  4. Do you prefer the boxes to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you want to be applied to the y-axis?

  6. Do you want to highlight or emphasize any specific amino acids?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the amino acids to be arranged?'
