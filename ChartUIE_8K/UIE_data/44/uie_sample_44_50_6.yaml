initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the amino acids' physical and chemical
  properties. Use columns for Name, Molecular Weight, and pKa1 values to show each
  amino acid's distribution and variations. Make it colorful and easy to interpret,
  highlighting any missing values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the Treemap?

  2. Would you like to include legends or annotations to help interpret the data?

  3. Are there any specific labels or text formats you''d prefer for displaying missing
  values?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout or style for the Treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  5. Would you like to include any additional details or metrics besides highlighting
  missing values?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like to categorize or group the amino acids
  in the Treemap?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Yes, I think including legends or annotations would help interpret the data.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. No, highlighting missing values is sufficient.

  6. I am not sure.'
