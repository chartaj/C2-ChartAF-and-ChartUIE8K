initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart showing the distribution of carbon,
  hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur for each amino acid.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different elements (carbon,
  hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the elements, and
  if so, where would you prefer it to be located?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better visual reference?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart''s title and axis titles?

  5. Would you like the data labels to be displayed on each segment of the stacked
  column?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart text?

  7. Should the y-axis be fixed to a specific scale, or adapt automatically to the
  data?

  8. Is there any specific order you would like the amino acids (x-axis) to be displayed
  in?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure where to locate it.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The chart''s title could be "Elemental Distribution in Amino Acids". The axis
  titles could be "Amino Acids" for the x-axis and "Percentage Composition" for the
  y-axis.

  5. Yes, include data labels on each segment of the stacked column.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Adapt automatically to the data.

  8. I am not sure.'
