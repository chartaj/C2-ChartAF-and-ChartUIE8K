initial_prompt: Create a heatmap depicting the correlation matrix of the physical
  and chemical properties of amino acids. Use properties like Molecular Weight, Residue
  Weight, pKa1, pKb2, pKx3, pl4, H, VSC, P1, P2, SASA, and NCISC. Make sure to handle
  missing values appropriately and ensure the heatmap clearly shows how each property
  correlates with the others. This visualization will help in understanding the relationships
  and interactions among various amino acid properties. Use appropriate colors to
  indicate strength and direction of correlations for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like us to handle missing values (e.g., imputation, removal)?

  3. What range of correlation values would you prefer for the color scale?

  4. Would you like the correlation values to be displayed on the heatmap cells?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the heatmap labels (e.g., font size,
  orientation)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a hierarchical clustering dendrogram?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred sizing or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Please handle missing values with imputation.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, I would like the correlation values to be displayed on the heatmap cells.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have any specific preference.

  8. I do not have any specific preference.

  9. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend to explain the color scale.'
