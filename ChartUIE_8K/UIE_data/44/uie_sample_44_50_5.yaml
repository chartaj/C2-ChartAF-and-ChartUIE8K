  title?

  7. Would you like to display a legend distinguishing the bins for Molecular Weights
  and Residue Weights?

  8. Do you have any preference for the width of the bins?

  9. Should the histogram display cumulative frequencies in addition to individual
  frequencies?

  10. Are there any specific data points or values you want to highlight in the histogram?'
