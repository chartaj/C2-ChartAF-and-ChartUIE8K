initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the amino acids data showing the
  relationship between Molecular Weight and residue Weight. Use different colors to
  represent each unique amino acid (Name), and add labels for the three sample amino
  acids provided (Alanine, Cysteine, Aspartic acid). Also, include markers to indicate
  the pKa1 values as the size of the points. This visualization will help us to compare
  the molecular and residue weights, while also observing the acid dissociation constant.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different amino
  acids?

  2. Would you like a specific shape for the markers or is the default acceptable?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels of the sample amino acids?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range or scale for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Should the labels for the sample amino acids be placed in a particular location
  relative to their points (e.g., above, below, to the left, to the right)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or labels of the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for its location?

  8. Are there any gridlines or background styles you would like to use or avoid?

  9. Is there a preferred format or style for the data point size representation based
  on the pKa1 values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Default font style and size are fine.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Below the points sounds good.

  6. No specific preferences for title or axis labels.

  7. Yes, please include a legend; location is flexible.

  8. No specific preferences for gridlines or background styles.

  9. I am not sure.'
