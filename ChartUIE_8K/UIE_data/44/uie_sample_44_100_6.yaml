initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the physical and chemical properties
  of amino acids from the provided data. Each rectangle should represent an amino
  acid, subdivided to show detailed attributes like Molecular Weight, Residue Weight,
  and counts of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur atoms. Highlight variations
  in pKa1, pKb2, pKx3, and pl4 values. Use color coding to differentiate the unique
  properties like VSC, P1, P2, SASA, and NCISC. The goal is to visually compare the
  diverse attributes and identify patterns or anomalies. Ensure the chart clearly
  distinguishes between amino acids using the 'Name' as the primary label.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating the unique properties
  like ''VSC'', ''P1'', ''P2'', ''SASA'', and ''NCISC''?

  2. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels, particularly the ''Name''
  of the amino acids?

  3. Are there any specific color preferences for different ranges or variations in
  ''pKa1'', ''pKb2'', ''pKx3'', and ''pl4'' values?

  4. Do you want a specific order for listing the amino acids, such as alphabetical
  order or sorted by a particular attribute?

  5. Should the treemap include tooltips or annotations to provide more detailed information
  when hovering over each rectangle?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or layout of the treemap to
  emphasize certain data attributes?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or key that explains the color coding and
  subdivisions?

  8. Do you prefer any borders or outlines around each rectangle to improve visual
  clarity?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not have any specific preferences for different ranges or variations in
  ''pKa1'', ''pKb2'', ''pKx3'', and ''pl4'' values.

  4. Alphabetical order would be good.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, including a legend or key would be helpful.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
