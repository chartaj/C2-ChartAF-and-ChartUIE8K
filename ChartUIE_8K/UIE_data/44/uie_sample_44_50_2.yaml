initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the molecular weights and residue
  weights of selected amino acids. Highlight the amino acids with missing pKx3 values
  and annotate the specific molecular weights of cysteine and aspartic acid.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing molecular
  weights and residue weights?

  2. How would you like the missing pKx3 values to be highlighted? Specific color
  or pattern?

  3. Where would you like the annotations for cysteine and aspartic acid''s molecular
  weights to be placed?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be displayed in the chart for better readability?

  5. What labels and titles would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Should the chart include a legend? If so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the font type and size for annotations
  and labels?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information or notes within the chart?'
