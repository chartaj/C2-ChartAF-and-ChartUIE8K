initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize global population trends over
  time from 1960 to 2022. Use the dataset with 'Country Name' and 'Country Code' columns
  and ensure all years are displayed on the x-axis, with population figures on the
  y-axis. Highlight specific countries like "Aruba," "Africa Eastern and Southern,"
  and "Afghanistan" to observe their population growth uniquely. Add text annotations
  on critical years where significant changes occur. The visualization will help analyze
  population growth patterns globally and for selected regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the chart, especially
  for highlighting specific countries?

  2. How would you like the critical years with significant changes to be annotated
  (e.g., specific text, arrows, different colors)?

  3. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for
  global trends vs. highlighted countries?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels and annotations?

  6. Should the chart title and axis labels include any specific text or formatting?

  7. How would you like to handle missing data points in the dataset, if any (e.g.,
  interpolation, gaps)?

  8. Do you prefer gridlines on the x-axis, y-axis, both, or none?

  9. Would you like to display data markers on the lines, and if so, do you have a
  preferred style or shape?

  10. Is there a particular width and height you prefer for the chart output?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, maybe specific text and arrows would be fine.

  3. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed.

  4. Solid lines for global trends and dashed lines for highlighted countries.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I do not know, whatever you think is best.

  7. I am not sure, maybe handle missing data with interpolation.

  8. Both x-axis and y-axis.

  9. Yes, display data markers. I do not know the preferred style or shape.

  10. I do not know.'
