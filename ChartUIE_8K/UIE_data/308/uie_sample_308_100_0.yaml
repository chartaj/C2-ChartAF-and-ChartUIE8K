initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing global population trends from 1960
  to 2022 using the provided dataset. The x-axis should represent the years, and the
  y-axis should plot population figures. Please include both data-driven text annotations
  and highlights. For annotations, show exact population values for significant years
  like 1980, 2000, and 2020 to highlight population growth trends. Use highlights
  to differentiate between different countries or regions, like using different colors
  or sizes for country markers to make comparisons clearer. Ensure the chart is visually
  engaging and easy to interpret for social science insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme to differentiate countries
  or regions?

  2. Would you prefer specific symbols or marker shapes for different countries/regions,
  or are different colors sufficient?

  3. How would you like significant years (1980, 2000, 2020) to be highlighted? For
  example, bold text, larger font size, different color, etc.?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the highlights and annotations?

  5. Do you have preferences for the style of annotations and text size for population
  values?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart to facilitate the reading of
  data points?

  7. Should the chart include titles and labels for both axes? If so, do you have
  any specific text in mind for these labels?

  8. Do you want the chart to include a title? If so, what would you like it to be?

  9. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be particularly highlighted
  or emphasized?

  10. How much padding or margin would you prefer around the chart plot for better
  readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different colors are sufficient.

  3. Different color and larger font size would be great.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful.

  7. Yes, please include titles and labels for both axes. "Years" for the x-axis and
  "Population" for the y-axis.

  8. Yes, the title should be "Global Population Trends (1960-2022)".

  9. I would like to emphasize China and India.

  10. I do not have a specific preference.'
