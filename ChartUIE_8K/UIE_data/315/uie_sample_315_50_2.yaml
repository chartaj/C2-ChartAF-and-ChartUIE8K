initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot highlighting animals by their average speed
  and weight. Annotate specific points to emphasize speeds and conservation status.
  Use colors to distinguish different families and add interactive text annotations
  for critical elements.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the scatter plot (e.g., aspect ratio
  or grid lines)?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing different families?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  4. Would you prefer specific marker shapes for different families?

  5. Is there a particular way you would like the axes to be labeled?

  6. Do you have a preference for the range of axes (e.g., specific minimum and maximum
  values for speed and weight)?

  7. Should the conservation status be indicated with specific symbols or colors?
  If so, what are your preferences?

  8. Do you prefer a legend to be displayed, and if so, where should it be positioned
  on the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like the chart to include grid lines or a background pattern for better
  readability?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the data point size or opacity?'
