initial_prompt: I want to create a line chart that visualizes key statistics about
  different animals from the dataset. Specifically, I want the x-axis to represent
  different animals, and the y-axis to show their average speed (km/h), height (cm),
  and weight (kg). Please use different colored lines to distinguish between these
  three metrics. Additionally, include a legend to clarify which line corresponds
  to which metric. Make it easy to compare these statistics for various animals. Please
  ensure the data points are clearly marked, and consider labeling the axes appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing average
  speed, height, and weight?

  2. Would you like specific animals to be emphasized or highlighted on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the data points markers (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  4. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., include full units like ''Height
  (cm)'' or just ''Height'')?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines for easier comparison between the metrics?

  6. Is there a specific font and size you prefer for the legend and axis labels?

  7. Do you have preferences for line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for different
  metrics?

  8. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  9. Would you like to display numerical values at each data point for added clarity?

  10. Are there any specific animals from the dataset that you would like to exclude
  or focus on?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. No, I do not have specific animals I want emphasized.

  3. Circles would be great for the data points markers.

  4. Include full units like ''Height (cm)''.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for easier comparison.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference for line styles.

  8. Yes, the chart should include a title and subtitle. The title could be "Comparison
  of Animal Statistics" and the subtitle could be "Average Speed, Height, and Weight."

  9. Yes, please display numerical values at each data point.

  10. I do not have any preferences for excluding or focusing on specific animals.'
