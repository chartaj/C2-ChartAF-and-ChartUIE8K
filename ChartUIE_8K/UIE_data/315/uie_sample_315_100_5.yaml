initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the distribution of animals by
  their conservation status across different countries. Use the "Countries Found"
  column for country locations and "Conservation Status" for coloring. The map should
  highlight the geographical spread and emphasize regions with higher numbers of vulnerable
  or endangered species. Ensure each country is color-coded based on the most threatened
  species found there. This will help in understanding the global distribution of
  animal conservation statuses and identify critical regions needing conservation
  efforts. Also, include legends and tooltips for better user understanding and interaction.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different conservation statuses?

  2. Should the map include country borders and labels?

  3. Do you have a preference for how to handle countries with multiple conservation
  statuses (e.g., color gradient, dominant status)?

  4. What level of geographical detail do you prefer (continent level, country level,
  etc.)?

  5. Would you like to include additional data layers, such as protected areas or
  biodiversity hotspots?

  6. How would you like to display the legend (e.g., side panel, bottom panel)?

  7. Do you have specific requirements for the map''s title and subtitles?

  8. Would you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  9. Should any regions be emphasized or highlighted beyond vulnerable or endangered
  species?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for text elements on the map?'
