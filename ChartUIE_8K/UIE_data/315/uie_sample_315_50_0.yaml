  average height and weight?

  2. How would you like the top speed to be highlighted (e.g., different color, bold
  text)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the placement of annotations indicating conservation
  status (e.g., next to the bar, at the top of the bar)?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the different colors
