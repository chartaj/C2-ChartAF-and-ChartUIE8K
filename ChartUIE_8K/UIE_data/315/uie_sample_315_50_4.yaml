initial_prompt: Please create a line chart depicting the average speed (km/h) of different
  animals over their respective lifespans (years). Use data points from different
  categories of animals and ensure each species is represented by a different line.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different species?

  2. Would you like the lifespan (years) on the x-axis to be uniformly scaled or adjusted
  based on actual data range?

  3. Should the y-axis (average speed in km/h) be set to a specific range or auto-adjust
  to the data?

  4. Do you want data points to be marked on the lines, or should they be smooth continuous
  lines?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines or background shades to improve readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific labels or annotations on the axes or data points?

  7. Do you want a legend to identify the species, and if yes, where would you like
  it positioned on the chart?

  8. Should we include any specific titles or descriptions on the chart to clarify
  the data presented?

  9. Would you like to differentiate lines using different line styles (e.g., dashed,
  dotted) in addition to colors?'
