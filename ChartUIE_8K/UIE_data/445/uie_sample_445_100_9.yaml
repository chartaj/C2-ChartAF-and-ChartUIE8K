initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart to compare the engagement metrics (retweet
  count, like count, and quote count) of tweets from the Dubois challenge. Group the
  data by username. Use datetime for the tooltip to see the timeline. Ensure each
  engagement metric is represented by a different color for clarity. The y-axis should
  represent the count, and the x-axis should display usernames. Include a legend to
  differentiate between retweets, likes, and quotes. Also, consider including the
  number of followers for each username as a secondary bar to show influence.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing the different
  engagement metrics (retweets, likes, and quotes)?

  2. Do you want a specific order for the usernames on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by highest engagement)?

  3. How would you like to differentiate the secondary bar for followers from the
  engagement metrics (e.g., different color, pattern, or placement)?

  4. Would you prefer to see the engagement metrics and followers as stacked bars
  or side-by-side bars?

  5. Is there a specific date format you would like to use in the tooltip for the
  datetime attribute?

  6. Do you want any particular styling for the legend (e.g., position, orientation,
  or format)?

  7. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?'
