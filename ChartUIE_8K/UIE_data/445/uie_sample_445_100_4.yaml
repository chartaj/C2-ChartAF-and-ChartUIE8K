initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the "like_count" column from the Dubois
  challenge tweets dataset. I want to see the distribution of like counts across all
  tweets. Additionally, make sure to label the x-axis as "Like Count" and the y-axis
  as "Frequency." Use a bin size that provides a clear view of the data distribution.
  Also, include a title for the chart, "Distribution of Likes for Dubois Challenge
  Tweets." Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like any grid lines to be included on the chart?

  3. Should the histogram show the distribution in counts (default) or percentages?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  5. Do you want to include any annotations or additional information on the chart?

  6. What level of bin size granularity do you prefer (e.g., small, medium, large)?'
