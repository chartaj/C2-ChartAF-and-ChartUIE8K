initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the engagement on the Dubois Challenge
  tweets dataset under the "data-science-and-analytics" category. The chart should
  display the counts of retweets, likes, and quotes for each tweet username. Ensure
  that the x-axis represents the usernames and the y-axis shows the count numbers
  for retweets, likes, and quotes. Please color-code the bars differently for retweets,
  likes, and quotes for comparative clarity. Include a legend to distinguish between
  these engagement types. Also, accommodate for missing values in the data where necessary.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bars representing
  retweets, likes, and quotes?

  2. Should the usernames on the x-axis be displayed at a specific angle or orientation
  to improve readability?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font type or size for the axis labels, legend, or
  the title of the chart?

  4. Would you like the bars to have any specific style, such as outlined or solid?

  5. Do you have any preference for handling missing values, such as specific markers
  or annotations?

  6. Would you like the chart to include gridlines or any specific background styling?

  7. Is there any specific way you would like the legend to be positioned or formatted?

  8. Do you have a title preference for the chart?

  9. Should any specific annotations or data labels be added to the bars for further
  clarity?'
