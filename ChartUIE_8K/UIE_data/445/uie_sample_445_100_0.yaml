initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of retweet_count,
  like_count, and quote_count for the "#DuBoisChallenge" tweets. Highlight outliers
  and annotate specific data points, such as tweets with the highest engagement. Note
  trends across different counts, and ensure axes are properly labeled for clarity.
  Utilize the annotations and highlights to emphasize key tweets and patterns to draw
  attention to the most impactful tweets. This visualization will help analyze tweet
  engagement and identify which posts gained the most traction, aiding in understanding
  engagement patterns in data science challenges.
