initial_prompt: Create a heatmap based on the Dubois challenge tweets data, focusing
  on the interaction metrics (retweet_count, like_count, and quote_count) across various
  usernames. This should help highlight which users are generating more engagement.
  Ensure the heatmap shows an easily interpretable gradient and includes appropriate
  axis labels and a color legend. Include New York location data points if possible.
  Use consistent color coding to represent the intensity of engagement. Additionally,
  label data points with Twitter usernames for better insights.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap gradient?

  6. Do you want to include any additional descriptive text or annotations within
