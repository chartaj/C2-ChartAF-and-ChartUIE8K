  (retweet count, like count, and quote count) of tweets from the Dubois challenge.
  Group the data by username. Use datetime for the tooltip to see the timeline. Ensure
  each engagement metric is represented by a different color for clarity. The y-axis
  should represent the count, and the x-axis should display usernames. Include a legend
  to differentiate between retweets, likes, and quotes. Also, consider including the
  number of followers for each username as a secondary bar to show influence.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

  like count, and quote count) of tweets from the Dubois challenge. Group the data
  by username. Use datetime for the tooltip to see the timeline. Ensure each engagement
  metric is represented by a different color for clarity. The y-axis should represent
  the count, and the x-axis should display usernames. Include a legend to differentiate
  between retweets, likes, and quotes. Also, consider including the number of followers
  for each username as a secondary bar to show influence.
