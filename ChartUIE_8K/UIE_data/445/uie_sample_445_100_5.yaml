initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the data from the Dubois challenge
  tweets. Please plot the number of tweets over time, using the 'datetime' column
  for the x-axis. For the y-axis, plot 'retweet_count', 'like_count', and 'quote_count'
  to compare engagement trends over the given period. Use distinct colors for each
  type of count. Include markers on the lines for data points. Add a legend to differentiate
  the lines. Include axis labels and a title for the chart. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the background color of the chart?

  2. Are there specific font types or sizes you would like for the axis labels?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the markers on the data points (e.g., circles,
  squares, or triangles)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the placement and styling of the legend?

  5. Is there a specific date format you prefer on the x-axis?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, what density and style do you prefer?

  7. Would you like to include annotations or tooltips for any specific data points?'
