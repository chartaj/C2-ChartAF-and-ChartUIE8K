initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare students' performance (math,
  reading, writing scores) based on gender and race/ethnicity. Highlight the top three
  scores in each subject to emphasize outstanding performances. Annotate these top
  scores to draw attention to significant achievements. The chart should help identify
  patterns in academic performance across different demographic groups. Use different
  colors for each gender and different shades for race/ethnicity groups to visually
  distinguish them. This visualization will aid in understanding educational disparities
  and success factors among various student demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme to be used
  for different genders?

  2. Do you have any specific shades or color preferences for representing different
  race/ethnicity groups?

  arrows, text boxes)?

  4. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the grouped bar chart?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the chart labels
  and annotations?

  6. Are there any specific guidelines or standards that we should follow for the
  chart''s layout and design?'
