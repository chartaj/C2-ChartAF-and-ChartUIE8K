initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize students' performance in exams.
  Annotate key points showing the highest and lowest scores in math, reading, and
  writing. Highlight data points by gender and parental education level for comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating gender and
  parental education level?

  2. Would you like the annotations for key points (highest and lowest scores) to
  display exact numerical values or just highlight the points visually?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled or scaled (e.g., standard numeric scale,
  specific intervals)?

  4. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for different genders or parental education
  levels?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like a legend to differentiate gender and parental education levels,
  and where should it be placed (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  7. Should there be grid lines on the chart, and if so, do you have a preference
  for their appearance (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  8. Do you have any specific size or aspect ratio requirements for the scatter plot?'
