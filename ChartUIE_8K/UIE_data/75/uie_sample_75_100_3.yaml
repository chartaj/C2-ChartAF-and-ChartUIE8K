initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the performance of students
  in exams. Use the 'gender' category to stack the bars, and plot 'math score', 'reading
  score', and 'writing score' on the x-axis, showing the 'parental level of education'
  on the y-axis. Ensure each section of the bar is color-coded according to 'gender'.
  This will help to understand the performance distributions across different educational
  backgrounds based on gender. Data is from the "Students Performance in Exams" dataset,
  focusing on education-related analysis.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the genders in the stacked\
  \ bar chart?\n2. Would you like to add labels or annotations to each section of\
  \ the bar for better clarity?\n3. Do you prefer to display the actual score values\
  \ on the bars, or just the graphical representation?\n4. How would you like the\
  \ axes to be labeled? Do you have any specific preferences for their titles or font\
  \ sizes?\n5. Do you have a preferred order for the categories under 'parental level\
  \ of education' on the y-axis?\n6. Would you like to include any legends or keys\
  \ for clarity, and if so, where should they be positioned?\n7. Are there any specific\
  \ formatting preferences for the grid lines or background of the chart? \n8. Would\
  \ you like to include a title for the chart? If yes, please provide the text for\
  \ the title."
