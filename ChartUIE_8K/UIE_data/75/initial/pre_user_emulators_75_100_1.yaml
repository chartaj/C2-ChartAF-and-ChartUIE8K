2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a scatter plot to visualize students' performance in exams. The x-axis should
  represent math scores, and the y-axis should represent reading scores. Highlight
  students' scores who have completed the test preparation course. Add annotations
  to highlight the highest and lowest scores in both math and reading. The purpose
  of this visualization is to identify if there is a correlation between math and
  reading scores and to see the impact of test preparation on performance. Add contextual
  labels for clarity, such as gender and race/ethnicity, for further insights.
