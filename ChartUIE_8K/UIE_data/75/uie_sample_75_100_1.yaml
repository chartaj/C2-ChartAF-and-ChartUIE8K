initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize students' performance in exams.
  The x-axis should represent math scores, and the y-axis should represent reading
  scores. Highlight students' scores who have completed the test preparation course.
  Add annotations to highlight the highest and lowest scores in both math and reading.
  The purpose of this visualization is to identify if there is a correlation between
  math and reading scores and to see the impact of test preparation on performance.
  Add contextual labels for clarity, such as gender and race/ethnicity, for further
  insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the students who completed the test preparation course to
  be highlighted (e.g., using different colors, shapes, or markers)?

  3. Where would you prefer the annotations for the highest and lowest scores to be
  placed on the chart?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to explain the different elements (e.g., colors,
  shapes) on the scatter plot?

  5. How would you like the contextual labels for gender and race/ethnicity to be
  displayed (e.g., as tooltips, labels next to the data points, a separate legend)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and tick marks (e.g., font style,
  size, color)?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the scatter plot? If yes, what style
  and color do you prefer?'
