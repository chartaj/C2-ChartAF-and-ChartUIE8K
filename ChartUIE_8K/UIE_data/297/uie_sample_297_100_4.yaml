initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the water quality dataset. On the x-axis,
  plot the 'Conductivity' values, and on the y-axis, plot the 'ph' values. Use different
  colors to represent the 'Potability' column, where one color indicates potable water
  (Potability=1) and another color indicates non-potable water (Potability=0). Ensure
  missing values are handled appropriately, so they do not appear on the chart. Title
  the chart "Water Conductivity vs pH Levels by Potability". This will help visualize
  if there is any correlation between conductivity and pH levels in determining water
  potability.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing potable
  and non-potable water?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font type and size for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  4. How would you like to handle missing values? Should they be omitted or filled
  using a specific method?

  5. Should the axis scales be linear or logarithmic?

  6. Do you want to include data point markers and, if so, any specific marker style
  or shape preferences?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the background color or theme of the
  chart?

  8. Would you like to include a legend in a specific location or with a particular
  style?

  9. Is there a need for tooltips or data labels for individual points on the scatter
  plot?

  10. Are there any specific axis ranges or limits you want to set for the x-axis
  (Conductivity) and y-axis (ph)?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Omit the missing values.

  5. Linear scale for both axes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include a legend.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
