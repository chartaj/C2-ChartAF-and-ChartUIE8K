initial_prompt: Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of 'ph', 'Hardness',
  'Solids', and 'Chloramines' by 'Potability'. Highlight outliers and annotate boxes
  to detail extreme values. This visualization aims to understand water quality factors
  influencing potability for environmental science analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for potability categories?

  2. Are there any particular labels or titles you would like to see on the axes?

  3. Do you prefer any specific style or formatting for outlier markers?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the plot?

  5. Do you have any preference for the arrangement or order of the ''ph'', ''Hardness'',
  ''Solids'', and ''Chloramines'' attributes on the plot?

  6. Should the plot include a legend explaining the potability categories?

  7. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for any of the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like to see "Water Quality Factor" on the x-axis and "Value" on the y-axis.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Yes, it would be helpful to include a legend explaining the potability categories.

  7. I do not have a specific range or scale preference for the axes.'
