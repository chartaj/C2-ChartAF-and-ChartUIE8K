initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing water potability. Use ph,
  Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes,
  and Turbidity data. Include text annotations to highlight regions with high contamination.
  Utilize varying color intensities to represent data values and highlight critical
  areas. Use the map to assess potability distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different levels
  of contamination?

  2. What type of base map do you prefer for the geographic heatmap (e.g., satellite,
  terrain, street map)?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be displayed (e.g., data labels, tooltips,
  pop-ups)?

  4. Should the heatmap just show the overall water potability or also allow highlighting
  specific variables like ''ph'', ''Hardness'', etc.?

  5. Do you have a specific geographic region or boundary you want the map to focus
  on?

  6. Are there specific thresholds for contamination levels you want to highlight
  with specific colors or annotations?

  7. What scale do you prefer for the color intensity representation (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  8. Do you need additional legends or explanatory notes to assist the audience in
  interpreting the heatmap?'
