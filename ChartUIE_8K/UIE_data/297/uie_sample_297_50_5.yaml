initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of missing values
  for each water quality parameter. Label x-axis with 'Parameters' and y-axis with
  'Count of Missing Values'. Each bar should represent a different parameter, divided
  into segments based on observed missing values. Use different colors for each segment.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different segments
  representing missing values in each parameter?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used for each segment,
  or do you prefer labels directly on the segments?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like to use for the axis
  labels and chart title?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier readability, or do you prefer a
  cleaner look without gridlines?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the parameters to be displayed on
  the x-axis, such as alphabetically or by the number of missing values?

  6. Would you like to include exact counts of missing values on each segment of the
  bars?

  7. Is there a preferred way for handling bar width and spacing between bars?

  8. Do you want the chart to have a specific title or any supplementary text to provide
  context?'
