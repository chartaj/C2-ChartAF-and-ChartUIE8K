  1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer using a medium green for potable and a medium red for non-potable areas.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, I''ll leave that up to you.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Highlight regions with missing data using a gray shade.

  7. I do not know, whichever is best.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include a legend to distinguish between potable, non-potable, and
