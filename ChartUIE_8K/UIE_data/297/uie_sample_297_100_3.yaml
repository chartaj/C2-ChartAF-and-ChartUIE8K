initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different
  water quality parameters and potability. Use the dataset provided, which includes
  columns like pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic Carbon,
  Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, and Potability. The heatmap should highlight how each
  of these parameters correlates with water potability. This will help in identifying
  which parameters are most significant in determining water quality and potability.
  Ensure that the heatmap is color-coded for easy interpretation of positive and negative
  correlations. Include labels and a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a specific color gradient to represent positive and negative correlations?

  3. Are you okay with standard correlation values (-1 to 1) or do you have a specific
  range in mind?

  4. Do you prefer specific labels for each axis, or should we use the standard column
  names from the dataset?

  5. Should the heatmap include gridlines between each cell for better separation
  of data points?

  6. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend to ensure readability?

  7. Would you like the heatmap to be presented with any specific margins or padding?

  8. Should we apply any data normalization techniques before calculating correlations,
  considering the missing values in some columns?

  9. Are there any specific data points or ranges that you want to highlight on the
  heatmap?

  10. Do you prefer a singular heatmap or multiple smaller heatmaps for different
  subsets of data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use a specific color gradient to represent positive and negative
  correlations.

  3. Standard correlation values (-1 to 1) are fine.

  4. Please use the standard column names from the dataset.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I prefer a singular heatmap.'
