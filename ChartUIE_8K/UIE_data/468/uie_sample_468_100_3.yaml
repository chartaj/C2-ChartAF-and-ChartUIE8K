initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap to visualize the data in file 468.csv. The
  heatmap should show the distribution of different employment statuses (Home-Office,
  mit Lohn, ohne Lohn, Kurzarbeit, arbeitslos, wie bisher) across various industry
  branches. Use color intensity to represent the values, with darker shades indicating
  higher numbers. Labels for both axes should be clear: industries on one axis, status
  categories on the other. Make sure to include a legend for clarity. This will help
  in understanding how different sectors are impacted in terms of employment during
  a specific time period.'

  2. Would you like to display numerical values within the heatmap cells?

  4. Do you have a specific order you would like the industries and employment statuses

  5. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include on
  the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  7. Should the color intensity scale be linear or logarithmic?

  8. Is there any specific title or subtitles you would like to include on the heatmap?'
