initial_prompt: Create a table chart presenting the employment state across different
  branches from the provided data. This table should include columns for Branche,
  Home-Office, mit Lohn, ohne Lohn, Kurzarbeit, arbeitslos, and wie bisher. Add text
  annotations for the highest and lowest values in each column to highlight significant
  differences. The chart will help visualize the impact of varying employment conditions
  across sectors. Use distinct colors to emphasize these differences, making it easier

  aid in understanding sector-specific employment trends.
