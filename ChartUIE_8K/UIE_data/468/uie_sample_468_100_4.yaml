initial_prompt: I need a radar chart to compare different industries regarding their
  employment statuses due to certain conditions. The data has categories like "Home-Office,"
  "mit Lohn," "ohne Lohn," "Kurzarbeit," "arbeitslos," and "wie bisher." Each branch
  or industry (like Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing) should have its own spoke
  on the radar chart to visualize these values. Ensure all needed categories are represented
  and clearly distinguishable. Use the sample data to plot and ensure the chart is
  easy to read and interpret, showing distinct differences between industries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the chart to represent
  different industries or categories?

  2. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the categories or industries on the radar chart?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed?

  5. Do you want to highlight any specific industry or category on the radar chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred style or theme for the radar chart (e.g., minimalist,
  colorful, professional)?

  7. What size or dimensions do you prefer for the radar chart?

  8. Are there any specific data points or values you want to emphasize or mark on
  the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any specific titles or captions for the chart and its
  axes?

  10. Do you have a preference for the number of concentric circles (gridlines) on
  the radar chart for better readability?'
