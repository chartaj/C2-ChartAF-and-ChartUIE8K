initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize x versus y. Add text annotations
  for significant data points to highlight trends or anomalies. Use highlights to

  5. Should the highlights be in a specific color or style to emphasize key data patterns?

  6. Is there a preferred font type or size for the annotations and axis labels?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their appearance?

  8. Are there any specific ranges for the x or y axes that you would like to focus
  on or limit the chart to?

  9. Do you prefer any specific chart titles or labels for the axes?
