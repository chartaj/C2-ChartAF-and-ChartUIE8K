initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the data with columns 'x' and 'y'. Both
  columns consist of float64 data types with no missing values. Highlight specific
  data points and add data-driven text annotations to these points to draw attention
  to their y-values. The scatter plot should visually emphasize key elements to help
  the viewer focus on highlighted areas before examining other points. Ensure that
  the chart is intuitive and aids in data analysis by clearly marking outliers or
  significant patterns in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for highlighting the specific
  data points?

  2. Would you like to customize the text annotations with any particular font or
  style?

  3. Should the highlighted data points have a different marker style compared to
  other points?

  4. Do you prefer any specific axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic) for the scatter
  plot?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers in the scatter plot?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate highlighted points from other
  points?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the scatter plot?

  9. Do you have any preference for the layout of the annotations (e.g., data labels
  placed above, below, or on the sides of the points)?

  10. Should there be axis labels, and if so, what should they be?

  11. Would you like the chart to have any specific background color or theme?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please use a different marker style for the highlighted points.

  4. Linear scale is preferred.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  8. "Scatter Plot of x vs. y" would be a fine title.

  9. Above the points would be preferred for annotations.

  10. Yes, label the x-axis as "X Values" and the y-axis as "Y Values".
