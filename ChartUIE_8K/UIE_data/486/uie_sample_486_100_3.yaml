initial_prompt: Use the data from '../Extra_datas/data/486.csv' to create a density
  plot. I want to visualize the distribution of 'x' and 'y' values. Make sure both
  datasets are represented clearly in the plot, with distinct colors or labels for
  easy differentiation. Ensure the plot is well-labeled, with axis titles and a legend
  if necessary. The plot should help in understanding how 'x' and 'y' values are distributed
  and if there are any patterns or trends in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating ''x''
  and ''y'' values?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style for the density plot, such as filled contours
  or line contours?

  3. Do you want any specific title for the chart?

  4. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis titles
  and legend?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you have preferences for the plot background color?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the plot to highlight
  specific data points or trends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No specific title needed, just something descriptive of the data distribution.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
