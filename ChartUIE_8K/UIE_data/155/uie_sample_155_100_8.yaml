initial_prompt: I'd like to see a histogram visualizing the salaries of engineering
  graduates based on their college GPA. This chart should show the frequency distribution
  of salaries categorized by ranges of GPA scores. Each bar in the histogram should
  represent a specific GPA range (e.g., 60-65, 65-70, etc.) and the height of the
  bar should indicate the number of graduates earning salaries within that GPA range.
  This will help in understanding how college GPA impacts the salary outcomes of engineering
  graduates. It should also include labeled axes for GPA ranges and salary frequencies.
questions: '1. What GPA range increments (e.g., 5-point ranges, 10-point ranges) do
  you prefer for the histogram bars?

  2. Do you have a preference for the color of the bars in the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  4. Should the y-axis represent absolute frequencies or relative frequencies (e.g.,
  percentages)?

  5. Is there any specific ordering of GPA ranges you prefer (e.g., ascending or descending
  order)?

  6. Would you like to highlight any particular GPA ranges or salary bins?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for text labels and titles?'
answers: '1. I prefer 5-point ranges for the GPA increments.

  2. I am not sure about the color of the bars.

  3. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "GPA Range" and the y-axis should be labeled
  "Number of Graduates."

  4. The y-axis should represent absolute frequencies.

  5. Ascending order will be fine.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for highlighting particular ranges.

  7. I do not know.'
