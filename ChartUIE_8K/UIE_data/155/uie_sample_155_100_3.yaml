initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the distribution of Engineering Graduates'
  salaries. The chart should display the breakdown by CollegeState, highlighting differences
  in median Salary across different states. Use categories such as CollegeTier, Specialization,
  and Degree to provide further granularity in each state. Additionally, incorporate
  markers for attributes like collegeGPA and GraduationYear to show their influence
  on Salary. This visual should help in understanding how various educational factors
  impact graduate salaries across different regions. Please ensure it is clear and
  easy to interpret for stakeholders.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating categories such
  as CollegeTier, Specialization, and Degree?

  2. Would you like to use specific color gradients to indicate the influence of collegeGPA
  and GraduationYear on Salary?

  3. Do you have any preference for the layout or ordering of states in the treemap
  (e.g., alphabetically, by median salary, etc.)?

  4. How would you like the markers for attributes like collegeGPA and GraduationYear
  to be displayed (e.g., as tooltips, labels, color intensity)?

  5. Would you prefer to show the exact median salary values in each section of the
  treemap or just focus on the visual differences?

  6. Is there a specific font or style you would like for the labels and annotations
  within the treemap?

  7. Do you need any additional contextual information or legends included in the
  treemap to help stakeholders understand the data better?'
