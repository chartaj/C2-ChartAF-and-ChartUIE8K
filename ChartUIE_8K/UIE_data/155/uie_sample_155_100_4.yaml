initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features
  and salary for engineering graduates. Focus on numerical columns like '10percentage',
  '12percentage', 'collegeGPA', 'English', 'Logical', 'Quant', 'Domain', 'ComputerProgramming',
  'ElectronicsAndSemicon', 'conscientiousness', 'agreeableness', 'extraversion', 'nueroticism',
  'openess_to_experience', and 'Salary'. Highlight any strong correlations or patterns
  that could provide insights into the factors influencing salary. Use a color gradient
  to represent the degree of correlation, making it easy to identify high and low
  correlations at a glance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for representing correlation
  strengths?

  2. Would you prefer to highlight strong positive and negative correlations differently?

  3. Is there a specific range of correlation values you want to be emphasized in
  the color gradient?

  4. Are there any particular labels or titles you want to include on the heatmap?

  5. How detailed would you like the axis labels to be (e.g., abbreviated or full
  titles)?

  6. Should we include a legend to explain the correlation color gradient?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?

  8. Would you like gridlines between the cells to be displayed or hidden?

  9. Are there specific numerical precision or rounding requirements for displaying
  correlation coefficients?

  10. Should we annotate the heatmap cells with correlation values?'
