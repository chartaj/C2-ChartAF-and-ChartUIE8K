initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing average salaries of engineering
  graduates across different states. Use CollegeState to determine regions and Salary
  for the heat values. Include data points like CollegeTier, Specialization, and collegeGPA
  to explain variations in the map.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for the
  heatmap?

  2. Should the map include specific labels for states, and if so, how detailed should
  they be?

  3. Would you like to see data points or markers for CollegeTier, Specialization,
  and GPA directly on the map, or as a separate legend?

  4. How would you like the information for CollegeTier, Specialization, and GPA to
  be represented: through different color hues, gradients, or patterns?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the map projection style (e.g., Mercator, Albers,
  etc.)?

  6. Would you prefer the map to emphasize certain states or regions more prominently?

  7. Are there any particular data ranges or thresholds for salaries that should be
  highlighted with specific colors or indicators?

  8. Should the heatmap include any annotation or explanatory notes directly on the
  map?

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to have a more minimalist design or a more detailed,
  information-rich layout?

  10. Is there any preference for how the legend or color bar should be displayed
  (e.g., position, size, format)?'
