initial_prompt: 'Visualize the distribution of engineering graduate salaries using
  a stacked bar chart. Utilize categories: Gender, Degree, and Specialization. Highlight
  differences in salary based on these dimensions. Annotate significant data points
  to draw attention. Make sure to illustrate the variation in College Tier''s impact
  on salaries. The goal is to predict salary outcomes based on education details,
  emphasizing college GPA, graduation year, and specific engineering specializations.
  The chart should effectively communicate salary trends and help in understanding
  the factors influencing engineering graduate salaries in different regions and specialties.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. Is there a specific order in which you would like the categories (Gender, Degree,
  Specialization) to be stacked?

  4. How would you like significant data points to be annotated (e.g., specific labels,
  arrows, different colors)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font or text size for the annotations and labels?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, side of the chart)?

  7. Should the X-axis or Y-axis be log-scaled due to the range of salary values?

  8. Should we group the Graduation Year data by specific ranges or display each year
  individually?

  9. Do you want to emphasize certain categories within Gender, Degree, or Specialization
  using different shades or patterns?

  10. Is there any specific region or specialty that needs to be highlighted differently
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Vertically.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Different colors and arrows would be good.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, a legend should be included. Positioned at the bottom of the chart.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Group the Graduation Year data by specific ranges.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. No specific region or specialty needs to be highlighted differently.'
