initial_prompt: Can you create a geographic heatmap to visualize the salary distribution
  of engineering graduates? Use the 'CollegeState' for geographic locations and 'Salary'
  for the heatmap values. Highlight areas with higher and lower salary concentrations
  distinctly. Ensure you depict the variance in salaries across different states clearly.
  Include a legend for salary ranges and write brief annotations for top and bottom
  salary states for better understanding. Also, consider the 'CollegeTier' if possible
  to differentiate the impact of college tier on salaries across states in the heatmap.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap to indicate
  different salary ranges?

  2. How many distinct salary ranges would you like in the heatmap legend?

  3. Would you prefer a certain color scheme to distinguish between different ''CollegeTier''
  levels?

  4. Are there any specific states you want highlighted or annotated in more detail?

  5. Do you have a preference for the style or format of the annotations for top and
  bottom salary states?

  6. Would you like to include any additional data layers, such as geographic boundaries
  or major cities, on the heatmap for better context?

  7. Is there a preferred map projection style (e.g., Mercator, Albers) you would
  like to use for the geographic heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like to highlight California and New York for top salaries, and maybe
  Mississippi and West Virginia for lower salaries.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
