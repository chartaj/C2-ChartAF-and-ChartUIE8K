initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart summarizing the average salary based on
  different engineering specializations and graduation years. Highlight top three
  paying specializations. Add text annotations to denote average salaries. This visualization
  will help understand salary trends for different specializations over years.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the different engineering
  specializations?

  2. Would you like the chart to be in a vertical or horizontal orientation?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like the top three paying specializations to be highlighted (e.g.,
  bold, different color, pattern)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the engineering specializations (e.g.,
  alphabetically, by average salary)?

  6. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Any specific title or labels you want for the chart and axes?

  8. Should the average salary be displayed as exact figures or rounded off to the
  nearest thousand?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Different color would be good.

  5. By average salary.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Rounded off to the nearest thousand.'
