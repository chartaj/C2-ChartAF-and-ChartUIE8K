initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the average Temperature (K) and Luminosity(L/Lo)
  for each Star type. Highlight the star type with the highest average temperature.
  Add text annotations for the maximum and minimum luminosity values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the highlighted bar for the star type with the highest average
  temperature to be displayed (e.g., different color, pattern)?

  3. Is there a specific font or style preference for the text annotations?

  4. Where would you prefer to place the text annotations for the maximum and minimum
  luminosity values (e.g., above the bars, inside the bars)?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be present in the chart? If so, should they be horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  6. Would you like to display data labels on the bars for average temperatures and
  luminosities?

  7. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  8. Should the chart include axis titles and a legend? If yes, do you have specific
  wording for them?

  9. How would you like to handle any overlapping of text annotations or data labels
  to ensure readability?

  10. Do you require any specific margins or padding around the chart for better visualization?'
