initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize star types over different temperatures
  (K). Use the data from the "Star dataset to predict star types" to plot the Temperature
  (K) on the x-axis and Luminosity (L/Lo) on the y-axis. Include text annotations
  to highlight specific data points for each star type, emphasizing values for Temperature
  (K) and Luminosity. Additionally, use highlights to differentiate star types visually,
  perhaps through color coding or size variations. This chart will help in understanding
  the relationship between temperature and luminosity across different star types
  in space and astronomy.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating the star
  types?

  2. Would you like specific star types to be highlighted using size variations of
  the data points?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations include additional details such as Star color or
  Spectral Class?

  5. Do you have any preference on the positioning of the text annotations relative
  to the data points?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific range for the Temperature (K) and Luminosity (L/Lo) axes
  that you would like to focus on?

  8. Do you prefer a title or label for each axis, and if so, what titles would you
  like to use?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding or size variations
  used for different star types?

  10. Would you like to include any additional markers or symbols to emphasize specific
  data points or trends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like specific star types to be highlighted using size variations
  of the data points.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, I would like gridlines to be included in the background for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include a title for each axis. The titles should be "Temperature
  (K)" for the x-axis and "Luminosity (L/Lo)" for the y-axis.

  9. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the color coding or size variations
  used for different star types.

  10. I do not know.'
