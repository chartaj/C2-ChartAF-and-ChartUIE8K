initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the relationship between Temperature (K)
  and Luminosity (L/Lo), highlighting different star types. Add text annotations for
  key data points and emphasize spectral classes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different star
  types and spectral classes?

  2. Are there specific key data points you would like to annotate?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  4. Should the line chart include grid lines for easier reading, and if so, what
  should their style be?

  5. Would you prefer that the axes have linear or logarithmic scales?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the spectral classes to be
  emphasized?

  7. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to include in the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the thickness or style of the lines representing
  the data?

  9. Should the chart include a title and, if yes, what should it be?

  10. Would you like any background shading or patterns for specific sections of the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I would prefer logarithmic scales for both axes.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, the title should be "Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram: Temperature vs. Luminosity".
