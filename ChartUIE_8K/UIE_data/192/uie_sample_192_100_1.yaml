  Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of star types based on their temperature.
  Annotate specific temperature values linked to certain star types to highlight their
  importance. Additionally, highlight specific temperature ranges where star colors
  and spectral classes vary significantly. This visualization will help in understanding
  the relationship between temperature and star types in the dataset. Star dataset
  to predict star types under space-and-astronomy. Ensure the chart is clear, as this
  will aid in identifying patterns and anomalies within the dataset.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting specific temperature
  ranges?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to be segmented into equal temperature intervals or
  dynamically based on the data?

  3. Do you have a preference for the placement and style of annotations for specific
  temperature values?

  4. Should the histogram bars be filled or outlined?

  5. Do you prefer a certain font style and size for labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like a legend to explain the highlighted temperature ranges, star colors,
  and spectral classes?

  7. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the star types on the histogram?

  8. Are there any specific temperature ranges you want to be particularly emphasized
  in the chart?

  9. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be major, minor, or both?

  10. Should the chart title and axis titles include specific descriptions? If yes,
  please specify.'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Equal temperature intervals would be fine.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Filled bars would be better.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, a legend explaining the highlighted temperature ranges, star colors, and
  spectral classes would be helpful.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, major gridlines would be good.

  10. Yes, the chart title could be "Histogram of Star Types by Temperature" and the
  axis titles could be "Temperature (K)" for x-axis and "Frequency" for y-axis.
