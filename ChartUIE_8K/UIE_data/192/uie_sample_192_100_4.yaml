initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of star temperatures
  (in Kelvin) and luminosities (L/Lo) grouped by star type using the provided star
  dataset. Include the different star colors and spectral classes as additional categories
  to show variations within each star type. This chart will help to identify the range
  and outliers for temperature and luminosity among various types of stars, useful
  for predictions in space and astronomy studies. Ensure the box chart is clearly
  labeled and color-coded for easy interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used in
  the chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a specific title or subtitle?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  axes?

  4. Do you prefer the box plots to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  5. Should the outliers be highlighted in a distinct manner or use default settings?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout orientation for grouping the different star types,
  colors, and spectral classes?

  9. Is there a specific way you want the legend to be displayed or customized?

  10. Are there any additional notes or contextual information you want to be displayed
  on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would prefer labels for both the x-axis (Star Type) and y-axis (Temperature
  in Kelvin or Luminosity in L/Lo).

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Highlighting the outliers in a distinct manner would be useful.

  6. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful for readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I do not have a specific preference for the legend display.

  10. No additional notes or contextual information are needed.'
