initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the different star types from the dataset
  highlighting their average temperature, luminosity, and radius. Include text annotations
  displaying the average absolute magnitude for each star type to draw attention to
  this specific metric. Use distinct colors for each star type to make them stand
  out. This visualization will help compare and contrast the characteristics of different
  star types, aiding in the prediction of star types based on given parameters. Add
  a title called "Star Type Characteristics." Ensure the chart is clear and easy to
  understand for space and astronomy enthusiasts.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for different
  star types?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped by star types or stacked?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled or customized?

  4. Are there any specific font preferences for the title and annotations?

  5. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the text annotations displaying
  average absolute magnitude?

  6. Would you like to include any grid lines for better readability? If yes, horizontal,
  vertical, or both?

  7. Is there a specific format or precision for displaying numerical values (e.g.,
  number of decimal places)?

  8. Do you have any specific preference for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
