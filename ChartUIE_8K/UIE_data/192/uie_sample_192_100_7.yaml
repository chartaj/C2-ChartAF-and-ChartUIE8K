initial_prompt: Hi, I'd like to create a stacked bar chart to visualize the dataset
  of star characteristics. Specifically, I want to compare different "Star types"
  with respect to their "Star color" and "Spectral Class." The chart should stack
  the counts of each star type for different star colors and spectral classes. This
  will help in understanding how different colors and spectral classes are distributed
  among the star types. Please use distinct colors for each star type and ensure the
  legend is clearly labeled. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific order for the star types, star colors, and spectral
  classes on the axes?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color palette for distinguishing between different
  star types?

  3. Should the y-axis display the count of stars in absolute numbers or percentages?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size used in the chart labels
  and legend?

  6. Should the chart include data labels for each segment within the stacked bars?

  7. Would you like to highlight specific star types, colors, or spectral classes?'

  1. I do not have a specific order for the star types, star colors, and spectral
  classes.

  2. I am not sure about a specific color palette, any distinct colors will be fine.

  3. The y-axis should display the count of stars in absolute numbers.

  4. I do not know if I want grid lines on the chart.

  5. I have no specific preference for the font style or size used in the chart labels
  and legend.

  6. Yes, please include data labels for each segment within the stacked bars.

  7. I am not sure if any specific star types, colors, or spectral classes should
  be highlighted.
