initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the star dataset to predict star
  types. Plot the star's temperature (K) on the x-axis and the star's luminosity (L/Lo)
  on the y-axis. Use different colors or symbols to differentiate between the various
  star types. Include a legend that identifies the star types and ensure the axes
  are labeled appropriately. Additionally, provide a title for the scatter plot that
  reflects the context of space and astronomy. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  between the star types?

  2. Do you prefer specific symbols for each star type, or is it acceptable to use
  default symbols?

  3. What specific title would you like for the scatter plot?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font size and style for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the scatter plot?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the scatter plot? If so, do you have specific preferences
  for their style?

  7. Is there a preferred range or scaling (e.g., logarithmic) for the x-axis (Temperature)
  or y-axis (Luminosity)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about specific symbols; default symbols are acceptable.

  3. I am not sure about the exact title, but it should reflect the context of space
  and astronomy.

  4. I do not have specific preferences for the font size and style.

  5. I do not know where the legend should be placed.

  6. I do not have a preference for gridlines.

  7. I do not know about the preferred range or scaling for the axes.'
