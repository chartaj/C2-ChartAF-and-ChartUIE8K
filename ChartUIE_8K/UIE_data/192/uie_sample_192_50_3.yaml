initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot to visualize star data, using ''Temperature
  (K)'' on the x-axis and ''Luminosity(L/Lo)'' on the y-axis. Differentiate points
  by ''Star type'' using colors. Title: "Star Types by Temperature and Luminosity".'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to differentiate
  star types?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot?

  3. Should the data points be marked with different shapes for each star type, or
  just differentiated by color?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Do you want a legend to be included in the chart? If so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Would you like to include axis labels and, if so, what should the labels be?

  7. Should the chart include annotations or markers for any specific data points
  or star types?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  9. Should there be any specific range limits set for the x-axis or y-axis?'
