2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart to visualize star types over different temperatures (K). Use
  the data from the "Star dataset to predict star types" to plot the Temperature (K)
  on the x-axis and Luminosity (L/Lo) on the y-axis. Include text annotations to highlight
  specific data points for each star type, emphasizing values for Temperature (K)
  and Luminosity. Additionally, use highlights to differentiate star types visually,
  perhaps through color coding or size variations. This chart will help in understanding
  the relationship between temperature and luminosity across different star types
  in space and astronomy.
