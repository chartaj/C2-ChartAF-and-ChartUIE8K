initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the distribution of star types based
  on their temperature. Highlight different star colors for each temperature range.
  Also, add text annotations to show unique temperature values for different star
  types to help identify temperature trends for each star type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting the different
  star colors for each temperature range?

  2. How would you like the temperature ranges to be defined (e.g., specific intervals
  or data-driven)?

  3. Should the histogram display the frequency or density of star types within each
  temperature range?

  4. Is there a specific format you prefer for the text annotations (e.g., font size,
  font type, color)?

  5. Would you like any particular style for the axes labels and titles (e.g., bold,
  italic, size)?

  6. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to include on the chart?

  7. Do you have preferences for the layout of the histogram, such as bin width or
  the number of bins?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines or a specific background color to enhance
  readability?

  9. Do you want any specific markers or symbols to indicate unique temperature values
  for different star types?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to add to the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Frequency would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. "Distribution of Star Types Based on Temperature" as the title would be great.'
