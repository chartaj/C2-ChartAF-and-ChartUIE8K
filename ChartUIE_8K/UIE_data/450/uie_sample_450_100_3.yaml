initial_prompt: Hi, I have a dataset that contains information about different types
  of fruits and their colors. The data seems to include two columns named "blueberry"
  and "blueberry.1" both with 5 unique values and no missing data. This data is under
  the food-and-drink category. I would like to create a Box chart to visualize the
  distribution of the different fruit colors within these columns. Could you please
  help me with this? I want to see how the data points spread out for each type of
  fruit color, and if possible, display the median for each fruit color category.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different fruit categories
  in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include any additional statistical measures besides the median,
  such as quartiles or outliers?

  3. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the box chart (vertical
  or horizontal)?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability, and if so, in what
  style (dashed, solid)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for labels and titles in the
  chart?

  6. Do you want to add any annotations or notes to the chart for clarification or
  emphasis?

  7. Would you prefer to display each fruit category in a different panel, or all
  within the same panel?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Vertical layout would be fine.

  4. Yes, gridlines in a dashed style would be good.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. All within the same panel would be better.'
