initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visually compare the frequency
  of different fruits listed in the columns 'blueberry' and 'blueberry.1' from the
  provided dataset. Use vibrant colors to distinguish between the various fruits,
  ensuring that apple, blueberry, and lime are easily identifiable. Highlight the
  blueberry category to emphasize its presence across both columns. Additionally,
  include shape annotations like arrows or boxes to highlight key differences or similarities
  between the columns. The chart should serve to quickly identify any trends or patterns
  in fruit distribution.

  the different fruits?
