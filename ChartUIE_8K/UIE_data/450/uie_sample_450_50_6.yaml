initial_prompt: I need a column chart comparing the frequency of different fruits.
  The x-axis should list fruits (apple, blueberry, lime) and the y-axis should show
  the count of each fruit in both 'blueberry' and 'blueberry.1' columns. Include a
  legend to distinguish between columns. Quantify how often each type of fruit appears.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  the two columns?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed side-by-side or stacked?

  3. Do you want any specific styles or fonts for the axis titles and labels?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scale?

  5. Do you want any gridlines or background shading in the chart?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or data labels you would like included on
  the bars?

  7. Would you prefer a particular orientation for the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  8. Do you have preferences for the chart title and its formatting?

  9. Should the chart include any tooltips or hover information for additional context?

  10. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the labels on the x-axis
  and y-axis?'
