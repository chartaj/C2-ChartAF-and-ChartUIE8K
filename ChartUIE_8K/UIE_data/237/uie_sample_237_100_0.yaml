initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Previous
  qualification (grade)' among students. Highlight the segments of the histogram to
  differentiate between those who 'Graduate' and 'Dropout' using distinct colors.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the 'Previous qualification (grade)' and the y-axis
