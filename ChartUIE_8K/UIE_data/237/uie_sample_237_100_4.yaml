initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'Admission
  grade' and 'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)'. Use the 'Target' attribute to color-code
  the points ('Dropout' and 'Graduate'). The x-axis should represent 'Admission grade',
  and the y-axis should represent 'Curricular units 1st sem (grade)'. This will help
  in understanding how admission grades correlate with semester performance and the
  likelihood of dropping out or graduating. Ensure to include appropriate labels and
  a legend for clarity.

  4. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or limits you wish to set for the x-axis (''Admission
  grade'') and y-axis (''Curricular units 1st sem (grade)'')?

  6. Should data points be represented with any specific shape or size?

  7. Would you like lines or a trendline to indicate correlation strength?

  8. Are there any specific themes or styles you prefer for the scatter plot (e.g.,
  modern, classic, minimalist)?

  9. Do you want any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key observations?

  10. Should there be any axis titles or descriptive text apart from the labels?'
