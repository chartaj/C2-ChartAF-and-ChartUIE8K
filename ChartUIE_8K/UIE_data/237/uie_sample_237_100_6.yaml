initial_prompt: I need a box plot to visualize the distribution of admission grades
  across different courses. The x-axis should represent the courses, and the y-axis
  should represent the admission grades. Include all available courses and show the
  median, quartiles, and any outliers. Additionally, color-code the boxes based on
  whether the students are scholarship holders or not. This will help to identify
  if there's any notable difference in admission grades between scholarship and non-scholarship
  students. Make sure to include labels and a legend for clarity. Use data from the
  provided dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to distinguish between
  scholarship and non-scholarship students?

  2. Would you like the median, quartiles, and outliers to have specific colors or
  styles for better distinction?

  3. Are there any particular course groups or categories that you would like to highlight
  in the box plot?

  4. Do you have a specified format or style for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Would you prefer the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  6. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend to ensure readability?

  7. Should the box plots be ordered in a particular way on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by median grade)?

  8. Are there any additional statistics or annotations you would like included in
  the box plot?

  9. Would you prefer any specific width or spacing for the boxes in the plot?

  10. Do you want gridlines included in the background for easier reading of the plot?
  If so, do you have a preference for their appearance?'
