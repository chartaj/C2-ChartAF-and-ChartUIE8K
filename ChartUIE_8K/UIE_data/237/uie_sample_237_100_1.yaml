initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the relationship between Admission
  grade, Curricular units (grades, enrolled, approved, evaluations), and Target. Highlight
  data-driven annotations for units with the highest and lowest grades. Use different
  colors to represent the range of grades from 0.0 to the highest. Highlight the dropout
  and graduate statuses distinctly to show clear performance indicators. The practical
  purpose is to easily identify trends and outliers in student performance to inform
  educational strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest grades to be annotated?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would like to use to distinguish dropout and
  graduate statuses?

  4. Do you prefer a certain range or scale for the colors representing grades?

  5. Is there a particular layout or orientation for the heatmap that you prefer?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding and annotations?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the annotations?

  8. Should the heatmap include any specific titles or labels for better clarity?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. The highest and lowest grades should be annotated with distinct markers, such
  as stars or arrows, and include the specific grade value.

  3. I would like to use green to distinguish graduates and red to highlight dropouts.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding and annotations.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include a title "Student Performance Heatmap" and labels for each
  axis.
