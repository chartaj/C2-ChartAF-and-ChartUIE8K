07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between
  species?

  2. Should the annotations for key data points include exact values or just highlight
  the points visually?

  3. How would you like the outliers or extreme values to be marked? (e.g., with different
  shapes, larger size, or labels)

  4. What style of highlights do you prefer to distinguish between species? (e.g.,
  background shading, borders)

  5. Do you have a preferred font or style for the chart title and annotations?

  6. Are there specific threshold values for Sepal_Length or Petal_Length that you
  consider important for annotation or highlighting?

  7. Do you prefer specific axis ranges or should the chart automatically adjust based
  on the data?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, in which style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  9. Do you have preferences for the chart legend placement or style?

  10. Are there any additional labels or notes you''d like to include on the chart
  (e.g., source of data, explanatory notes)?
