initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the distribution of Sepal and Petal
  lengths by species using the given dataset. Please ensure that the treemap highlights
  the variance in length for each species category, making it easy to compare Sepal_Length,
  Sepal_Width, Petal_Length, and Petal_Width among setosa, versicolor, and virginica
  species. Additionally, since there are no missing values, please make sure the entire
  dataset is utilized for accuracy. This will help in understanding the length distributions
  clearly and effectively in a single visual representation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  species in the treemap?

  2. Would you like labels to display the exact values of lengths on each segment
  of the treemap?

  3. How detailed do you want the labeling to be? Should it include lengths, species
  name, both, or any other information?

  4. Is there a preferred order for displaying species in the treemap?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for text within the treemap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors or any other attributes
  of the treemap?

  7. Should the treemap have specific size ratios or dimensions to fit any special
  display or medium?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like labels to display the exact values of lengths on each segment.

  3. Both lengths and species name.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. I am not sure.'
