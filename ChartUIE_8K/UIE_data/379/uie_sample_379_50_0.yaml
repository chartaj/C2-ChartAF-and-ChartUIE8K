initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Sepal and Petal
  Length across different Species. Highlight significant differences and annotate
  outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box charts representing
  different species?

  2. Would you like to include any specific statistical annotations (e.g., mean, median)
  on the box charts?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be annotated? (e.g., specific symbols, different
  colors, text labels)

  4. Do you have a preference for the scale of the axes (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to include gridlines for easier visualization of values?

  6. Is there a specific layout you prefer for displaying multiple box charts (e.g.,
  side by side, stacked)?

  7. Would you like to add any specific titles or labels to different sections of
  the chart?

  8. Do you want to display any reference lines (e.g., quartiles, percentiles) in
  the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include mean and median annotations.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Side by side layout would be great.
