initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the provided space mission dataset.
  Plot the 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Price' on the y-axis to visualize the trend over
  time. Differentiate the data points by 'Company' using different colors. Highlight
  'RocketStatus' using different markers, such as circles for 'Retired' and squares
  for 'Operational'. Add a title "Space Mission Costs Over Time by Company" and label
  axes appropriately. Ensure that missing values for 'Price' have proper treatment,
  such as being excluded from the plot. This will help in analyzing the cost trends
  of space missions across different companies.
