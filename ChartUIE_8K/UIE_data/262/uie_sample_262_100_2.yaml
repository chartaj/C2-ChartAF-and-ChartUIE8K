initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap of global rocket launch locations from
  1997 to 2003, highlighting the year-wise frequency of launches. Add text annotations
  to the locations with the highest activity and highlight these areas with a distinct
  color. Include data-driven text annotations to emphasize locations, years, mission
  status, and rocket status. This will help focus on patterns in space missions, providing
  an overview of activities by different companies in various regions. The map should
  be visually engaging to describe the space mission dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific visual styles for the text annotations, such as font
  type or size?

  3. Should the map include additional geographic details such as borders, rivers,
  or city names?

  4. Are there any specific locations or regions you want to be more prominently highlighted?

  5. Do you prefer a particular method for representing the frequency of launches
  (e.g., color gradient, proportional symbols)?

  6. Should the heatmap display a legend or key to indicate the frequency ranges?

  7. Are there any specific years that you want to highlight or draw special attention
  to?

  8. How should the mission status and rocket status be represented in the text annotations
  (e.g., icons, color codes)?

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to show data as continuous values or categorized into
  bins?

  10. Is there a specific map projection you would like to use for the geographic
  visualization?'
