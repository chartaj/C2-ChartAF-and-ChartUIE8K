initial_prompt: Visualize a histogram depicting the price distribution of corn over
  time. Highlight notable price peaks and troughs with data-driven text annotations
  to emphasize these variations. Include non-data-driven annotations to provide context
  about factors influencing price changes. Use different colors or sizes to highlight
  specific price ranges that are significantly higher or lower than average. This
  visualization will help understand pricing trends and identify patterns within the
  agricultural market.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme to be used in
  the histogram?

  2. How would you like the notable price peaks and troughs to be annotated? (e.g.,
  specific text, symbols)

  3. What kind of non-data-driven annotations would you like to include for context?
  (e.g., weather events, market events)

  4. Should the different price ranges be highlighted using colors, sizes, or both?

  5. Are there any specific time periods or events that should be emphasized in the
  chart?

  6. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the text annotations on the chart?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like the x-axis (date) and y-axis (price)
  to be labeled or formatted?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included explaining the color coding or size variations
  used in the histogram?

  9. Are there any other specific features or elements you would like to see in the
  histogram to make it more effective for the audience?'
