initial_prompt: Visualize a scatter plot depicting corn price trends for agriculture
  and farming. The x-axis should represent the date, while the y-axis should show
  the price. Highlight key dates where significant price changes occur by modifying
  their appearance, such as increasing point size or changing color. Include annotations
  for these highlighted points to display exact price values, drawing attention to
  them before examining other data points. This will emphasize important price changes
  and provide context for market behavior. Use non-data-driven annotations for additional
  context or commentary, if necessary, to enhance understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlighted points
  on the scatter plot?

  2. Are there particular key dates or events that you want us to highlight?

  3. Would you prefer the annotations for highlighted points to be in any specific
  format or style?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the points on the scatter plot, especially
  for the highlighted ones?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color or size changes of the
  points?

  6. Do you prefer any specific typeface or font size for the annotations and axis
  labels?

  7. Should the X-axis (date) be formatted in a particular way, such as month/day/year
  or year-month-day?

  8. Is there additional commentary or context you''d like to include in the non-data-driven
  annotations?

  9. Are there any specific gridlines or tick marks you would like to see on the chart
  for better readability?

  10. Do you prefer a particular layout or positioning for the chart title, axis labels,
  and annotations?'
