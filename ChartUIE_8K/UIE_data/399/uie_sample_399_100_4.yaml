initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart that visualizes the corn price data over time.
  Specifically, use the 'date' for the x-axis and 'price' for the y-axis. Ensure the
  x-axis accurately reflects the progression of dates provided, and plot the corresponding
  'price' values to show trends and fluctuations over time. This will help in understanding
  how corn prices have varied on different dates. Please include labels for both axes
  and a title indicating "Corn Price Trends from 2013 to 2018" to make the chart clear
  and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line representing
  corn prices?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should the date labels on the x-axis be presented in a particular format (e.g.,
  YYYY-MM-DD)?

  5. Would you like markers to be displayed at each data point along the line?

  6. Should there be a legend included, even if there''s only one line representing
  corn prices?

  7. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the line?

  8. Would you prefer a specific background color for the chart or the entire plot
  area?

  9. Is there any additional information you would like to see annotated directly
  on the chart, such as specific high or low points?

  10. Do you want the chart to include a trendline or moving average line in addition
  to the actual data points?'
