initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the corn price trends over time. Add
  text annotations on data points with the highest prices to highlight peaks. Use
  color highlights to emphasize extreme values. This helps in identifying price fluctuations
  in agriculture and farming.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histogram bars and
  highlights?

  2. What style of text annotation do you prefer for highlighting the peaks (e.g.,
  font size, color, and positioning)?

  3. Should the histogram have grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer any specific date format on the x-axis (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD)?

  5. What level of transparency (if any) should the bars have to ensure visual clarity?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color highlights and annotations?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for the price that you consider as
  extreme values for color highlighting?

  8. Do you have a preferred way to display the y-axis values (e.g., in dollars, including
  decimal places)?

  9. Would you like to add any additional contextual information or labels to the
  chart (e.g., average price line, historical events influencing prices)?'
