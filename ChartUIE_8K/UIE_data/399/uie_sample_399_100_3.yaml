initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the corn prices over different dates
  for agricultural analysis. The data file is `../Extra_datas/data/399.csv`, containing
  columns 'date' and 'price' with no missing values. Please create a chart showing
  'date' on the x-axis and 'price' on the y-axis, ensuring each bar represents the
  price of corn on a specific date from the sample data provided. The chart should
  help in understanding price fluctuations over the specified dates, which is crucial
  for making farming decisions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the dates on the x-axis to be formatted in a specific way (e.g.,
  ''MM-DD-YYYY'' or ''MMM YYYY'')?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer specific labels or titles for the x-axis, y-axis, and the chart
  itself?

  5. Would you like to see data values displayed on top of each bar?

  6. Is there a specific range or scale you want for the y-axis?

  7. Do you want any annotations or markers for significant price changes or dates?

  8. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text and labels
  in the chart?

  9. Should the chart include a legend, even though there is only one data series?

  10. Do you wish to include any reference lines, such as average price or thresholds?'
