initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart displaying gene expression levels across
  different samples, specifically highlighting SCC, Adeno, and SCLC samples from the
  provided data. Use different bubble sizes for expression levels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference regarding the color scheme of the bubbles
  to differentiate SCC, Adeno, and SCLC samples?

  2. Do you want a legend included in the chart for easy identification of sample
  types?

  3. Should the gene names be displayed on the chart or only when hovered over?

  4. Do you have a preferred range for bubble sizes to represent expression levels?

  5. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., scientific notation,
  decimal points)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis titles and labels?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines to assist in interpreting the data?

  8. Is there a particular gene or set of genes that you would like to emphasize within
  the chart?

  9. Would you like the default view to be zoomed in on a specific region of the chart?

  10. Do you require any annotations or notes directly on the chart to highlight key
  observations or findings?'
