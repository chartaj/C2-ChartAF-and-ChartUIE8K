initial_prompt: Create a violin plot comparing gene expression levels across different
  conditions in the data. Use columns like 'fetal_lung', '232-97_SCC', '68-96_Adeno',
  etc., on the y-axis, and the 'gene' column to split the violins.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette for the
  violin plot?

  2. Would you like to include mean or median lines in each violin?

  3. Do you prefer to display the data points for individual values within the violins?
