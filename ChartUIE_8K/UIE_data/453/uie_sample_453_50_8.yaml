initial_prompt: 'Please create a bar chart using the dataset from ''453.csv'', showing
  the gene expression levels across different samples like Adeno, SCC, LCLC, and SCLC.
  Focus on three specific genes: IMAGE:196992, IMAGE:587847, and IMAGE:1049185.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars to distinguish between
  different genes or samples?

  2. Should the x-axis represent the genes or the samples?

  3. How would you like the y-axis to be labeled? (e.g., ''Gene Expression Level'',
  ''Expression Intensity'')

  4. Would you prefer the bars to be grouped or stacked for comparing the gene expression
  levels?

  5. Should error bars be included to indicate variability or confidence intervals
  in the data?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  7. Would you like to display data values on top of each bar?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for labels and titles?

  9. Should the legend be displayed and if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned?
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)

  10. Are there any specific samples that should be highlighted or emphasized in the
  chart?'
