initial_prompt: I'd like to create a bubble chart using the provided dataset. Each
  bubble should represent a different gene from the "gene" column. The X-axis should
  display "fetal_lung" values, while the Y-axis shows "232-97_SCC" values. The size
  of the bubbles should correspond to the "232-97_node" values. This chart will help
  visualize the relationships and variations across different genes and conditions,
  making it easier to spot outliers and trends in the data. Please ensure the chart
  is clear and each bubble is distinguishable with proper labeling. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for the bubbles?

  2. How would you like the bubbles to be labeled? For example, showing the gene name
  or value?

  3. Would you prefer a specific color palette for different ranges of values?

  4. Do you have any preference for the axis scales (linear or logarithmic)?

  5. Do you prefer gridlines in the background to make it easier to identify specific
  values?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  titles?

  7. Do you want to add a legend that explains the size of the bubbles and what they
  represent?

  8. Would you prefer any specific margins or padding around the chart?

  9. Should there be any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  10. Do you prefer a specific style or format for displaying the outliers, such as
  highlighting or different colors for outlier bubbles?

  11. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the bubbles to be labeled with the gene name.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, I prefer gridlines in the background.

  6. I do not have any specific preference.

  7. Yes, please include a legend that explains the size of the bubbles.

  8. No specific preferences for margins or padding.

  9. The title could be "Gene Expression Comparison in Different Conditions".

  10. I do not know.

  11. I do not have a preferred aspect ratio.'
