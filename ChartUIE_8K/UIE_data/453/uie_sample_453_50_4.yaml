initial_prompt: I'd like a column chart comparing gene expression levels across different
  samples like 'fetal_lung', '232-97_SCC', and '232-97_node'.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different samples (''fetal_lung'',
  ''232-97_SCC'', ''232-97_node'')?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for easier comparison of values?

  3. Do you prefer the gene names to be displayed horizontally or rotated vertically
  on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis display the exact gene expression levels or just a relative
  scale?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific gene expressions that have notable differences
  across the samples?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order in which the samples are displayed on
  the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart''s title and axis labels?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the samples?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart text?'
