initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the average medical insurance
  charges by region. Use the provided dataset containing columns such as age, sex,
  bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges. This analysis will help in understanding
  the regional differences in insurance costs. Each bar should represent a different
  region, and the height of the bars should reflect the average insurance charges
  in that region. Ensure that the chart is easy to read, and the regions are distinctly
  labeled. The y-axis should represent the average charges, while the x-axis should
  list the regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  regions?

  2. Would you like to include exact average charge values on top of each bar?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to the chart, or is it unnecessary since each
  bar represents a distinct region?

  7. Do you want to set a specific range for the y-axis, or should it be automatically
  scaled based on the data?

  8. Should any additional annotations or text be added to highlight particular insights
  or findings?'
