initial_prompt: Create a histogram using the provided medical insurance dataset. Focus
  on visualizing the distribution of 'charges' as the main variable. Apply text annotations
  to highlight specific data points, such as the highest and lowest charges. Utilize
  highlights to distinguish between smokers and non-smokers, and add a legend to clarify
  this distinction. The purpose of this chart is to better understand the range and
  frequency of medical charges and how smoking status potentially influences costs.
  Include context regarding the business utility of predicting insurance costs.

  colors or some other method?'
