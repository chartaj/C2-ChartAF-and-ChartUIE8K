initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the medical insurance charges
  over different ages. Ensure that the chart differentiates between smokers and non-smokers
  by using separate lines for each category. This will help us understand how smoking
  status affects the insurance costs across various age groups. Include proper labels
  for the x-axis (age) and y-axis (charges), and a legend to distinguish between smokers
  and non-smokers. This will assist in our analysis for Medical Insurance Cost Prediction.
