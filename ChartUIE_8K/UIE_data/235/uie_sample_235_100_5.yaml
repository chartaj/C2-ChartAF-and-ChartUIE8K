initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to analyze the relationships between different factors
  affecting medical insurance costs. The dataset includes columns like age, sex, bmi,
  children, smoker, region, and charges. I want to see how these variables correlate
  with each other, especially with the charges column. Also, highlight significant
  correlations. This is for a business report on medical insurance cost prediction,
  so the visualization should be clear and professional. Make sure the heatmap includes
  a legend and labels for easy interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display the correlation coefficients on the heatmap cells?

  3. How would you prefer significant correlations to be highlighted? (e.g., using
  different colors, bold outlines, etc.)

  4. Do you want to include annotation text within the heatmap cells?

  5. Should the heatmap include hierarchical clustering to group similar variables
  together?

  6. Are there specific ranges or thresholds for correlation values that you want
  to highlight?

  7. Do you have a preferred ordering for the variables in the heatmap?

  8. Would you like gridlines between the cells to be visible or hidden?

  9. Should the heatmap have axis labels rotated for better readability?

  10. Are there any specific tips or titles you would like to include in the heatmap
  for additional context?'
