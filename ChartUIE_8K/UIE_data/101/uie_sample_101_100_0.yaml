initial_prompt: Visualize the distribution of 'Product Price' among the different
  'Product Categories' as a density plot to observe pricing trends across categories.
  Highlight the 'Retailer' 'nykaa.com' to emphasize the source of data. Annotate the
  top three product categories with the highest median prices to focus viewer attention
  on those segments. This helps in understanding how pricing varies with different
  makeup and beauty products, which can influence purchasing decisions. Make sure
  to include 'Product Reviews Count' as another layer of annotation to correlate product
  popularity with price distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the density plot?

  2. Would you like the density plot to be smoothed or with specific bins?

  3. How would you like the highlighted ''nykaa.com'' data to be visualized (e.g.,
  different color, different marker, etc.)?

  4. What style of annotation do you prefer for the top three product categories with
  the highest median prices (e.g., arrows, labels, circles)?

  5. Should the ''Product Reviews Count'' annotation be displayed as text on the plot
  or as an added visual layer like a heat map?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  8. Would you like a legend to indicate the highlighted retailer and other annotations?

  background color)?'
