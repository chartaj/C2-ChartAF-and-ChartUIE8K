initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  the number of Global Speakers and the Size of various languages spoken in New York
  City. The x-axis should represent the Size of the language groups (e.g., Smallest,
  Small, etc.), and the y-axis should represent the number of Global Speakers (e.g.,
  49,800). Different languages can be represented as different points on the scatter
  plot. The points should be color-coded by World Region to offer additional insights.
  This will help in understanding how different language sizes correspond to their
  global speaker populations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for coding the different world regions?

  3. Are there any specific symbols or shapes you want to use to represent the different
  languages?

  4. Would you like to add labels to the points on the scatter plot to identify the
  languages?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the x-axis and y-axis labels or their font sizes?

  6. Would you like to include any grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be
  major, minor, or both?

  7. Are there any particular ranges or scales you want to use for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  8. Would you like to include a legend? If yes, do you have a preferred location
  for it on the chart?

  9. Do you want to add any annotations or notes to highlight specific points or trends
  on the scatter plot?

  10. How would you like to handle cases with missing ''Global Speakers'' data? For
  example, should they be excluded, or should a placeholder be used?'
