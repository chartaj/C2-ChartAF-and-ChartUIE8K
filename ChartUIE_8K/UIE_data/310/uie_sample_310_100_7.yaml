initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to display the number of languages spoken in different
  world regions in New York City. Use the 'World Region' column to represent the different
  regions on the x-axis, and the 'Language' column to count the number of languages
  for each region on the y-axis. This will help visualize the diversity of languages
  spoken in each world region within the city, providing insights into cultural and
  linguistic diversity. Include a legend to distinguish between different world regions
  and ensure the chart has a clear title like "Languages by World Region in New York
  City."
