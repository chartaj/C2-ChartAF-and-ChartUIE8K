initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing "Languages of New York City" focused
  on global speakers from various world regions. Use different shades to represent
  the number of global speakers, highlighting higher density areas. Annotate with
  text the highest and lowest global speakers data points. Include highlights for
  language families and statuses. The purpose is to show the linguistic diversity
  and distribution in New York City, making it easier to understand the concentration
  and variety of languages spoken. This visualization will help in recognizing the
  multicultural landscape of the city.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different shades representing
  the number of global speakers?

  2. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the annotations of the highest
  and lowest global speakers data points?

  3. Is there a particular way you want the highlights for language families and statuses
  to be displayed?

  4. Should there be a legend explaining the shades and highlights, and if so, do
  you have preferences for its placement?

  5. Are there any specific areas or boroughs of New York City you want to focus on
  or exclude from the map?

  6. Do you prefer a certain map projection or style for the Choropleth visualization?

  7. Would you like to include additional context or notes on the map itself?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette, but I would like it to be clear
  enough to differentiate between the different densities.

  2. I am not sure about specific font styles or sizes; just ensure they are readable
  and distinct.

  3. I do not know; please use your best judgment for displaying highlights for language
  families and statuses.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I have no specific preference for its placement,
  so please choose a location that is usually effective.

  5. No specific areas or boroughs to focus on or exclude; cover all of New York City.

  6. I do not have a preference for a specific map projection or style, so please
  choose what you think works best.
