initial_prompt: Hi, I would like to visualize the Languages of New York City dataset
  using a histogram. Specifically, I want to create a histogram chart that shows the
  distribution of languages based on their "World Region". This should help in understanding
  which world regions contribute the most languages to New York City. Please make
  sure to handle any missing or null values appropriately. The x-axis should represent
  the different world regions, and the y-axis should indicate the count of languages
  from each region. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating the world regions
  on the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include labels on the x-axis showing the names of the world
  regions?

  4. Do you want the counts on the y-axis to be displayed as numbers or percentages?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for axis labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to add gridlines to enhance readability on the chart?

  7. Should the histogram bars have a specific spacing or width?

  8. Are there any legends required to indicate colors or other attributes in the
  chart?

  9. Do you want to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the data to be sorted in any particular order (e.g., ascending
  or descending counts)?

  11. Is there a preferred way you would like missing or null values to be represented
  in the chart?

  12. Do you want to add any reference lines or markers for easier comparison?'
