initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of languages spoken
  in different world regions of New York City and the corresponding number of global
  speakers for each region. Use the "World Region" column for the x-axis and the "Global
  Speakers" column for the y-axis. Each bar group should represent different regions,
  with two bars per group: one for the count of languages and one for the total number
  of global speakers. Annotate specific bars to highlight regions with the highest
  and lowest counts. This helps in understanding the linguistic diversity in NYC.'
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars representing the count
  of languages and the global speakers?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the count of languages
  and the global speakers?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and annotations?

  4. Should the x-axis categories (world regions) be sorted in a specific order?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, in which direction (horizontal,
  vertical, both)?

  6. Are there any specific bar widths or spacing preferences you have in mind for
  the grouped bars?

  7. How would you like the annotations to be positioned on the chart (e.g., directly
  on the bars, above the bars, etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  9. Would you like to display the numerical values on top of each bar?

  10. Do you have a preferred style for the y-axis to display large numbers (e.g.,
  using commas, scientific notation)?'
