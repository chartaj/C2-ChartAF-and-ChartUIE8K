initial_prompt: Please create an area chart visualizing Apple stock prices over time.
  The x-axis should represent the 'Date' and the y-axis should represent the 'Close'
  prices. Alongside, please include areas for 'Open', 'High', and 'Low' prices for
  comparative analysis. Ensure that volume is depicted as an underlaying gradient
  or separate area chart at the bottom to indicate trading activity. Make the chart
  interactive, if possible, so I can hover over dates to see exact values. Keep the
  design clean and professional, reflecting the business context of the data. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart areas representing
  ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', and ''Close'' prices?

  2. Should the volume be displayed as an underlaying gradient or as a separate area
  chart at the bottom?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legends?

  5. Do you have a preference for the format or style of the date labels on the x-axis?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'',
  and ''Close'' prices?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or markers (e.g., significant events) on
  the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis have any predefined range or should it auto-scale based on
  the data?

  9. Is there a specific line style (solid, dashed, etc.) you prefer for the boundaries
  separating different areas in the chart?'
