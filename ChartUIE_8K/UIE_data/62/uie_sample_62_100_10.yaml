initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the Apple stock's
  closing prices over time. Use the "Close" column from the given dataset, ensuring
  to include all entries. Please ensure that the bins are appropriately sized to show
  detailed variations in the closing prices. Additionally, color-code the bars to

  axis labels and a title for clarity. Make it as informative and visually appealing
  as possible. Thank you!
