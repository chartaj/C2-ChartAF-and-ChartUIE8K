initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Apple stock data using a bubble chart to show
  the relationship between 'Open', 'High', and 'Volume'. Each bubble should represent
  a trading day, with the bubble size proportional to the 'Volume'. The 'Open' prices
  should be on the X-axis, 'High' prices on the Y-axis, and use colors to differentiate
  between different date ranges or specific years. This will help in understanding
  the stock's behavior over time and how the trading volume impacts the price movements.
  Please make sure the dates are formatted properly and the bubbles are sized appropriately
  for easy comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  between date ranges or specific years?

  2. What date ranges or specific years would you like to differentiate by color?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding for date ranges
  or years?

  4. Do you have a preference for the bubble size scaling method for the ''Volume''
  attribute?

  5. Would you like the chart to display gridlines to aid in reading the data points?

  6. Should there be a specific date format displayed on the tooltip or axis labels?

  7. Do you prefer specific axis labels or titles for the X-axis (''Open'') and Y-axis
  (''High'')?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to include any specific annotations or data labels on the bubbles?

  10. Do you want to include a trend line or any other statistical overlays on the
  chart to highlight trends or correlations?'
