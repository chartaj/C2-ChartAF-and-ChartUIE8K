initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart showing Apple's stock price movements
  over time. Label key points with data-driven text annotations to highlight significant
  changes in stock prices. Use color-coded areas to differentiate between 'Open,'
  'High,' 'Low,' 'Close,' 'Adj Close,' and 'Volume.' Highlight critical financial
  events for additional context. This visualization will help analyze long-term trends
  and patterns in Apple stocks.
