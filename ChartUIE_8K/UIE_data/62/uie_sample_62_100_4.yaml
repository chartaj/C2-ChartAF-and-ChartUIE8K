initial_prompt: I have Apple stock data with columns like Date, Open, High, Low, Close,
  Adj Close, and Volume. I want to visualize how the Adjusted Close prices of Apple
  stocks have changed over time. Please create a scatter plot with Date on the x-axis
  and Adj Close on the y-axis. Make sure the points are distinct and visually appealing.
  Also, include a trend line to help in understanding the overall trend. Use appropriate
  labels and titles to clearly represent this information. Please ensure all missing
  values are managed in the plot. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the scatter plot points?

  2. What color would you like for the trend line?

  3. Do you prefer a certain shape or style for the scatter plot points?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  5. How should missing values be managed in the plot (e.g., ignore, interpolate)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have any specific scales or ranges?

  8. Do you need any specific annotation or markers for significant dates or events
  on the plot?

  9. Would you like a legend to explain the points and trend line, even if they are
  distinct?

  10. Are there any specific guidelines or design standards you want the chart to
  adhere to?'
