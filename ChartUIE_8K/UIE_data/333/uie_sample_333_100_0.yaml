initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing renewable energy data from
  1960 to 2023 for various locations worldwide. Use the "LOCATION," "TIME," and "Value"
  columns from the dataset. Highlight the years where renewable energy values show
  significant changes or trends. Annotate key data points to draw attention to notable
  increases or decreases in renewable energy usage over the years. The purpose is
  to provide a clear visual representation of the growth and fluctuations in renewable
  energy utilization, helping users quickly grasp important trends and shifts in the
  data over time.
