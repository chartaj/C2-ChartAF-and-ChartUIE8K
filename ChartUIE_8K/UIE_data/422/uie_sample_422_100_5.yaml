initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of wine points from
  the provided dataset. The data includes wine reviews, and each review has an assigned
  point score. Focus on the "points" column and categorize the wines into different
  point ranges (e.g., 80-84, 85-89, 90-94, 95-100). Display the percentage of wines
  that fall into each point range. The chart should help identify the most common
  quality range of wines in the dataset. Leverage the data details to label the chart
  appropriately and make it easy to understand for wine enthusiasts.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different point
  ranges in the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to include exact percentage values inside the pie chart slices
  or outside as labels?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and title of the
  chart?

  4. Should the pie chart include a legend to explain the point ranges, or do you
  prefer labels directly on the chart sections?

  5. What title would you like for the pie chart?

  6. Are there any specific formats you would like for the point ranges (e.g., 80-84
  or 80 to 84)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order of the point ranges in the chart (e.g.,
  ascending or descending)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information or annotations on the chart,
  such as data source or sample size?

  9. Should the chart have any specific style (e.g., minimalist, detailed, colorful)?

  10. Do you have a preference for the chartâ€™s aspect ratio or dimensions?'
