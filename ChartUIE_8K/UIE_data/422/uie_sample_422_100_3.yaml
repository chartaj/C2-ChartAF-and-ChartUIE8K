initial_prompt: I am looking for a choropleth map visualizing the best wine you can
  get around the world. The data should be based on the points and the countries from
  the provided dataset. Please ensure that different shades indicate the range of
  wine ratings (points). Additionally, include tooltips showing the country name,
  average points, and the number of wines reviewed. This visualization should help
  me quickly identify which countries have the highest-rated wines, according to the
  provided dataset. Please integrate the missing values and make the map as insightful
  as possible. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for indicating different ranges of
  wine ratings on the map?

  2. Do you have any preference for the number of rating intervals or categories displayed
  on the map?

  3. Should lower-rated wines be represented with lighter or darker shades?

  4. Do you prefer any specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) for the
  choropleth map?

  5. Is there a specific range of rating points you would like to highlight or focus
  on?

  6. Would you like the countries with missing values to be represented in a special
  way (e.g., with a unique color or pattern)?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the legend and tooltips on
  the map?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the country names and ratings
  in the tooltips?

  9. Are there any additional details you would like to see in the tooltips aside
  from the country name, average points, and the number of wines reviewed?

  10. Would you like to include any additional geographical features or labels on
  the map (e.g., major cities or wine regions) to provide more context?'
