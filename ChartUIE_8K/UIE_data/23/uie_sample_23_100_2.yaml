initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the US Cars Dataset. Focus
  on the distribution of car conditions against each state. Use text annotations to
  highlight top states with the most cars available. Highlight the bars with the highest
  and lowest counts to emphasize differences. The chart will help us quickly understand
  where most cars are located and in what condition, aiding in regional marketing
  strategies. Include color differences for clear visibility of conditions like '10
  days left', '6 days left', and '2 days left'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different car conditions
  (''10 days left'', ''6 days left'', ''2 days left'')?

  2. Would you like to display the total number of cars per state as well?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations for the top states to be formatted
  (font size, color, etc.)?

  4. Is there a specific way you''d like the bars with the highest and lowest counts
  to be highlighted (e.g., different shades, patterns)?

  5. Are there any specific states that you want to focus on or highlight besides
  the top states with most cars?

  6. Would you prefer the chart to have any specific title, subtitle, or additional
  descriptive text?

  7. Do you want the chart legend to be placed in a specific location, or is the default
  placement acceptable?

  8. Should the axis labels be customized in any particular way?'
