02_initial_prompt: Visualize the US Cars Dataset with a Choropleth map to show the
  average car prices across different states. Annotate key states with the highest
  and lowest average prices to highlight significant regions. Additionally, use text
  annotations to provide context for extreme values. Highlight states with dense populations
  or significant car markets to emphasize their importance. Ensure the map clearly
  distinguishes between states using color gradients. The map should help users quickly
  identify price trends and market differences across the country. This visualization
  will aid in understanding geographic pricing patterns in the US automobile market.
