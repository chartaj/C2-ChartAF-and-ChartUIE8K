02_initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart visualizing the US Cars Dataset from the
  automobiles data. Please use the 'year' for the X-axis, representing different years.
  For the Y-axis, plot the 'price' to show how the price of cars has changed over
  the years. Include data points for multiple brands, so we can see trends for each
  brand over time. Adding different colors or line styles for each brand would be
  helpful for distinguishing them. This will help in understanding how the pricing
  trends vary for different car brands over the years. Thank you!
