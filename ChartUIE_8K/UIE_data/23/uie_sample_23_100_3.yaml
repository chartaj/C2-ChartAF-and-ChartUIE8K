initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart visualizing the US Cars Dataset from the automobiles
  data. Please use the 'year' for the X-axis, representing different years. For the
  Y-axis, plot the 'price' to show how the price of cars has changed over the years.
  Include data points for multiple brands, so we can see trends for each brand over
  time. Adding different colors or line styles for each brand would be helpful for
  distinguishing them. This will help in understanding how the pricing trends vary
  for different car brands over the years. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used for different
  brands?

  2. Do you want specific line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) for different brands?

  3. Should we include a legend to distinguish the different brands?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font for axis labels and titles?

  5. Should data points be marked with symbols on the lines for better visibility?

  6. Is there a specific range you would like to set for the Y-axis (price)?

  7. Would you like to add grid lines to the chart for easier comparison of data points?

  8. Do you have a preference on the chart title and axis titles?

  9. Should we annotate specific data points of interest that show significant changes
  or trends?'
