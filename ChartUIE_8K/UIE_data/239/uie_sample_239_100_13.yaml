initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the global blood type distribution.
  The chart should show the frequency of different blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-,
  A-, B-, AB-) across multiple countries. The x-axis should represent the different
  blood types, and the y-axis should show the number of countries that have each specific
  blood type. This will help in understanding how common or rare each blood type is
  globally. Use the provided data for accurate representation and include an appropriate
  legend and labels for clarity. This will be useful for health research purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different blood types?

  2. Would you like to include specific titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and
  legend?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you want any annotations or additional markers to highlight specific data
  points?

  7. Would you like the histogram bars to have specific spacing or width preferences?

  8. Should the chart include a subtitle or additional descriptive text?

  9. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the legend (e.g., position,
  size, color)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include titles. X-axis: "Blood Types", Y-axis: "Number of Countries".

  3. I do not know.

  4. Horizontal would be fine.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I do not have any specific preferences.'
