initial_prompt: I need a box chart that showcases the global distribution of blood
  types. The chart should handle multiple blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-,
  AB-) for several countries. Use data from the CSV file to illustrate the spread,
  median, and potential outliers in the blood type distributions across countries.
  The boxes should represent the quartiles for each blood type, with whiskers indicating
  the range. Additionally, handle missing values appropriately for a more accurate
  representation. The focus is on visualizing the data comprehensively for health
  data analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for different blood types?

  2. Do you want any specific ordering for the blood types on the chart?

  3. Are there any particular countries you would like to highlight or focus on?

  4. How should the chart handle missing values (e.g., imputing values, excluding
  from analysis)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the width of the boxes in the box plot?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the chart?

  7. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  9. Is there a specific range for the axes that you prefer, or should they be automatically
  adjusted based on the data?

  10. Would you like to display the mean value in addition to the median on the box
  plot?'
