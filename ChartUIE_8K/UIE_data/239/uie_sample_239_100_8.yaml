initial_prompt: 'I want a geographic heatmap that shows blood type distribution across
  different countries. The map should display variations in the percentage of populations
  with specific blood types: O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, and AB-. Utilize color gradients
  to represent higher or lower percentages for each blood type in countries. Include
  a legend to clearly indicate what the colors represent for each blood type. The
  map should be interactive, allowing me to select and view the distribution percentages
  for each blood type individually. Please ensure each country''s blood type data
  is accurately represented on the map.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color gradients representing
  different blood types?

  2. Are there specific countries that you want to highlight or focus on?

  3. Would you like any additional data labels or annotations on the map?

  4. Do you prefer a particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Should each blood type have a distinct color gradient, or would you prefer a
  unified color scheme with variations?

  6. How detailed would you like the legend to be (e.g., simple color bands, precise
  percentage ranges)?

  7. Are there any specific accessibility features youâ€™d like to include (e.g., colorblind-friendly
  palettes)?

  8. Should the map include additional geographic features (e.g., major cities, borders)?

  9. Would you like to add any descriptions or titles to the map for better context?

  10. Do you have any preference for the layout or orientation of the legend and other
  elements on the map?'
