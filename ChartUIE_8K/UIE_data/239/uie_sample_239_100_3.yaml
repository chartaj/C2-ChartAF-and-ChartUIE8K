initial_prompt: Visualize the global distribution of blood types using the given data.
  Create a pie chart for each blood type category (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-)
  showing the percentage distribution across different countries. Ensure each pie
  chart segment represents a different country based on the provided data. This will
  help in understanding the prevalence of each blood type around the world. Emphasize
  countries with larger populations and distinct variations in blood type distributions.
  This will provide a comprehensive view of global blood type distribution using the
  summarized dataset. Use labels or legends for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie charts?

  2. Should the charts have a specific title format?

  3. Do you want the charts to include percentage labels on the segments?

  4. Do you prefer the legend to be inside or outside the pie chart?

  5. Should the charts emphasize specific countries or regions with larger populations
  or notable variations?

  6. Is there a preferred order for presenting the blood type categories?

  7. Do you require any specific font styles or sizes for the labels and legends?

  8. Would you like to display the actual population numbers along with the percentages
  in the charts?

  9. Should we include any additional annotations or notes to highlight important
  insights?

  10. Do you have a preference for the size or layout of the pie charts?'
