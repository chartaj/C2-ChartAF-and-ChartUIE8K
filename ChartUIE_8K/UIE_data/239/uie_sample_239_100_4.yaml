initial_prompt: I need a Choropleth map visualizing global blood type distribution
  by country. Use data points such as O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB- from the provided
  dataset. Each country should be colored based on the percentage prevalence of a
  particular blood type. Ensure it is easy to distinguish regions with different blood
  type distributions. Include a legend to interpret the color scale. Missing data
  points should be handled, showing them as a different color or pattern. The map
  should provide a clear visual comparison of blood types across countries globally.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  different blood types?

  2. How would you like the map to handle missing data? Should it use a specific color
  or pattern?

  3. Would you like the legend to include specific information or annotations beyond
  just interpreting the color scale?

  4. Is there a preferred layout or style for the labels on the map (e.g., country
  names, percentage values)?

  5. Do you have a specific projection type in mind for the map (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  6. What level of granularity are you expecting for the data representation (e.g.,
  country level)?

  7. Should the map include any boundary lines, such as country borders, for enhanced
  clarity?

  8. Are there any additional visual elements or markers you would like to include
  (e.g., major cities, regions with high population density)?

  9. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color or style to ensure
  it aligns with any specific themes or branding?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Missing data should use a specific color or pattern.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like the percentage values included if possible.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Country level representation is expected.

  7. Yes, please include country borders for enhanced clarity.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not have a preference for the background color or style.'
