initial_prompt: I need a table chart for the global blood type distribution by country.
  The table should list each country along with the population and the percentage
  distribution of the various blood types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-). Make
  sure to highlight the rows where some blood type data is missing. The source data
  format has columns like Country, Population, O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-. This
  will help visualize blood type distribution geographically.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for color schemes or highlights
  in the table, especially for rows with missing blood type data?

  2. Would you like the table to include sorting functionality by country or any other
  attribute?

  3. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be emphasized in the
  table?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the table text?

  5. Should the table include any additional notes or annotations for certain countries
  or blood type distributions?

  6. Would you like the table to be displayed in a specific layout, such as landscape
  or portrait orientation?

  7. Do you have a preference for the level of precision (number of decimal places)
  for the percentage distribution of blood types?

  8. Would you like to include summary statistics, such as average values or total
  population counts, at the bottom of the table?'
