initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for global blood type distribution using the provided
  data. Map countries to their respective population and blood type percentages (O+,
  A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-). Highlight regions with higher and lower proportions
  of each blood type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradients?

  3. Would you like to display the exact percentages on the heatmap cells?

  4. Do you have a preferred shape or size for the heatmap cells?

  5. How would you like to handle countries with missing blood type data?

  6. Should the heatmap include annotations for regions (e.g., continents)?

  7. Would you like to group countries by regions or display them individually?

  8. Do you prefer any particular ordering of countries (e.g., by population, alphabetical)?

  9. Should the heatmap include labels for each blood type category?

  10. Do you need any specific geographical boundaries or borders highlighted on the
  map?

  11. Are there any particular regions or countries that you would like to highlight
  or emphasize?

  12. Would you prefer a fixed scale for color gradients or a varying scale based
  on data distribution?'
