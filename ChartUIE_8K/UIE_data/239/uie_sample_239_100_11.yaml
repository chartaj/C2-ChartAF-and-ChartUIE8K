initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart visualizing the global blood
  type distribution. The x-axis should represent countries, and the y-axis should
  show the population. Each column should be stacked to show the percentage of each
  blood type (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-) within the population for each country.
  Use different colors to represent each blood type. Ensure that the chart is easy
  to read and provides a clear comparison among the countries. Include a legend to
  identify the blood types. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each blood type in the
  chart?

  2. Is there a particular order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical order, by population size)?

  3. Would you like the percentages of each blood type to be displayed as labels on
  the chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right of the chart)?

  5. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or emphasize in the chart?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines or any other specific background elements
  to enhance readability?'
