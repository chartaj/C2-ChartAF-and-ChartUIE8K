initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the global blood type distribution
  data. The heatmap should display different countries on the y-axis and various blood
  types (O+, A+, B+, AB+, O-, A-, B-, AB-) on the x-axis. Each cell should represent
  the percentage of the population with that specific blood type, with a color gradient
  indicating the value range from low to high. Ensure to highlight missing values
  distinctly. This chart will help to easily compare blood type distributions across
  different countries. The dataset includes population statistics, so integrate this
  where relevant. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient used to indicate
  the percentage values?

  2. How would you like missing values to be highlighted? (e.g., specific color, pattern,
  etc.)

  3. Should the population statistics be displayed directly on the heatmap, or integrated
  into the tooltip/hover information?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences regarding the labels or legends on the chart?

  5. Is there a particular way you would like us to sort the countries on the y-axis?

  6. Would you prefer additional annotations or markers to be included for specific
  countries or blood types?'
