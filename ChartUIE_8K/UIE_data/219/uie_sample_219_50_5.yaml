initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart visualizing logistics quality scores
  for various states in India. Use parameters like Road Infrastructure, Rail Infrastructure,
  Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure, etc., as individual stack components for each
  state. This will help compare overall logistics quality across different states
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the stacked column
  chart?

  2. Do you want specific labels or annotations on the chart to highlight key insights?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify each stack component clearly?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for the stack components (e.g., Road Infrastructure
  on top)?

  5. Would you like to include data values on the stacks for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific range for the y-axis you want to set?

  7. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be displayed in the background of the chart?

  9. Do you have a specific format for the title of the chart?

  10. Are there any specific states you want to compare within the chart?'
