initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to compare the logistics quality across different
  states of India. Use parameters like Quality of Road Infrastructure, Rail Infrastructure,
  Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure, Unimodal Terminal Infrastructure, Warehousing
  Infrastructure, and Logistics Services for Gujarat, Haryana, and Punjab. Highlight
  each state's performance in these areas to visualize which state excels in specific
  logistics attributes. This chart will help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses
  in logistics infrastructure and services across these states. Make sure each axis
  represents one parameter and each state is plotted on these axes for a comprehensive
  comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme for each state on the
  radar chart?

  2. Do you wish to include data labels or markers on the axes for each state''s score?

  3. Would you like a legend in a specific location on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  5. Do you want the chart to have grid lines for easier comparison between states?

  6. Should there be a title or caption for the radar chart? If so, any specific wording?

  7. Do you want to normalize the data values to a common scale for better visual
  comparison?'
