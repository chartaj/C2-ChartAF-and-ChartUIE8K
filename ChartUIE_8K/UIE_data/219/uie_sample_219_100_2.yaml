initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the 'Final Score' for different states
  comparing their logistics quality. Use the annotations to highlight the states with
  the highest and lowest scores, as well as any outliers. The chart aims to show the
  distribution of scores across states, emphasizing variations in logistics quality.
  Additionally, include a summary area describing the key metrics such as Quality
  of Road Infrastructure, Quality of Rail Infrastructure, and Timeliness of Cargo
  Delivery, to provide context about factors influencing the scores. This will help
  in understanding state-level logistics efficiency.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the states to be displayed in a specific order on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, ascending/descending by ''Final Score'')?

  3. How would you like the summary area to be presented (e.g., as a sidebar, below
  the chart, as a tooltip)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size and style of annotations for highlighting
  the highest, lowest scores, and outliers?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the labels and title of
  the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific range for the y-axis (e.g., automatic, fixed range)
  to better visualize the ''Final Score'' distribution?

  8. Should the summary metrics (Quality of Road Infrastructure, Quality of Rail Infrastructure,
  Timeliness of Cargo Delivery) be represented in a specific format (e.g., plain text,
  bar chart, bullet points)?'
