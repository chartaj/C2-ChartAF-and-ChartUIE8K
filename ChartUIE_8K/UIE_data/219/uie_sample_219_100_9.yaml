initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the 'State wise scores of individual
  parameters' for different states in India as per the provided dataset. The heatmap
  should include parameters like 'Quality of Road Infrastructure', 'Quality of Rail
  Infrastructure', 'Quality of Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure', 'Quality of Unimodal
  Terminal Infrastructure', etc. Use color gradients to represent the varying scores
  across different states for each parameter. Label the axes with states and parameters,
  and include a legend to indicate the score ranges. This will help in comparing the
  logistics quality across states effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient or color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to have gridlines separating each cell?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels?

  4. Should the color gradient represent higher scores with darker or lighter colors?

  5. Do you want to include numerical values within each cell of the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the heatmap?

  8. Should the states and parameters be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetically,
  by score)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Darker colors for higher scores would be good.

  5. Yes, please include numerical values within each cell.

  6. I do not know.

  7. "State-wise Scores of Logistics Infrastructure Parameters in India"

  8. Alphabetically would be fine.'
