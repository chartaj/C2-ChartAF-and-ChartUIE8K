initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the "Final Score" of logistics
  quality for each state in India. Highlight states with higher scores to emphasize
  their performance. Include text annotations for top three states (Gujarat, Haryana,
  Punjab) showing their individual scores. The map should illustrate the overall distribution
  of logistics quality across the country, helping identify regions excelling or needing
  improvement in transportation and logistics. Use different shades or colors to represent
  varying score ranges clearly. Keep the map interactive, allowing users to hover
  over states for more detailed information from other parameters like "Quality of
  Road Infrastructure."

  score ranges on the map?

  2. How would you like the states with higher scores to be highlighted?

  4. What level of granularity or detail would you like for the hover-over information?

  5. Are there any specific visual elements or styles you want to incorporate into
  the map design (e.g., borders, labels)?

  6. Would you like to include any additional legends or keys to explain the color
  coding and score ranges?'
