initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the "Logistics Quality in India"
  from the transportation-and-logistics sector dataset. The x-axis should represent
  different states, and the y-axis should show the scores of various parameters such
  as "Quality of Road Infrastructure," "Quality of Rail Infrastructure," "Quality
  of Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure," etc. Use different colored lines for each
  parameter to make the comparison clear across states like Gujarat, Haryana, and
  Punjab. This will help show how each state's logistics performance varies across
  different quality measures.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  parameters?

  2. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should data points be marked on the lines for each state?

  4. Would you like to include a specific title for the chart?

  5. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific font preferences or sizes for the labels on the axes and
  legend?

  7. Is there a need for annotations or highlights for specific data points or states?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specific range, or should it auto-adjust based on the
  data?

  9. Do you prefer the lines to be solid, dashed, or any other style?

  10. Is there a preferred layout or orientation for the x-axis labels given the number
  of states?'
