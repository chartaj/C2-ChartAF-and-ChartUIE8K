initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart showing the evaluation of logistics quality
  across different states in India. The x-axis should list the states (e.g., Gujarat,
  Haryana, Punjab), and the y-axis should have the scores. Stack different logistics
  parameters (e.g., Quality of Road Infrastructure, Quality of Rail Infrastructure,
  Quality of Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure, etc.) for each state to signify
  the cumulative rating. This will help in comparing the overall logistics quality
  and identifying which state excels in which specific logistics parameter. The title
  should be 'State-wise Logistics Quality in India'.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each logistics parameter
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart title and labels?

  3. Would you like the states on the x-axis to be grouped in any particular order
  (e.g., alphabetical, by overall score, etc.)?

  4. Do you want any specific annotations or call-outs for notable data points within
  the chart?

  5. Should the y-axis have a specific range of values, or should it automatically
  adjust based on the data?

  6. Are there any additional legends or descriptions you would like to include in
  the chart?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you prefer any specific aspect ratio or dimensions for the chart?

  9. How would you like the scores on the y-axis to be formatted (e.g., decimal places,
  percentage)?

  10. Is there a particular background color or theme you prefer for the chart?'
