initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of final scores
  for different states in the logistics quality dataset. Include each state's final
  score on the x-axis and the frequency of states within each score range on the y-axis.
  This will help visualize the overall performance of the states in terms of logistics
  quality.
questions: '1. What specific score range intervals would you like to use for the x-axis
  (e.g., 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)?

  2. Do you have any preferred color schemes or themes for the histogram?

  3. Should the histogram include any labels or annotations on specific data points?

  4. Would you like to include a title and axis labels? If so, please provide the
  preferred text.

  5. Do you want to see any summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) overlaid on the
  histogram?'
answers: "1. I am not sure.\n2. I do not know.\n3. No specific preference.\n4. Title:\
  \ \"Distribution of Final Scores by State in Logistics Quality\"\n   X-axis: \"\
  Final Score\"\n   Y-axis: \"Number of States\"\n5. I am not sure."
