initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart showcasing the logistics quality in India. Use
  the following categories from the data: "Quality of Road Infrastructure," "Quality
  of Rail Infrastructure," "Quality of Multi-Modal Terminal Infrastructure," and "Quality
  of Unimodal Terminal Infrastructure." Display the scores for three states: Gujarat,
  Haryana, and Punjab. Each category should have bars representing the scores for
  these states side by side for easy comparison. Title the chart "State-wise Comparison
  of Logistics Quality Parameters." This chart will help visualize which states have
  better infrastructure in various logistics aspects. Keep the axes labeled and include
  a legend.'

  different states?

  2. Would you like to see gridlines in the chart to enhance readability?
