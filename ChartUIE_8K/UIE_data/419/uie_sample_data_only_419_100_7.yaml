07_questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for representing high, medium,
  and low densities?

  2. Is there a preferred color scheme for ''bike_count'' and ''ped_count'', or can
  they be the same?

  3. Would you like the time of day to be broken down into specific intervals (e.g.,
  hourly, every 30 minutes)?

  4. Should weekends and weekdays be shown separately, or can they be combined?

  5. Do you want any specific focus or emphasis on certain crossings or times of day?

  6. Would you prefer the heatmap to show absolute counts or normalized counts (e.g.,
  density relative to the maximum observed count)?

  7. Is there a preference for how missing values should be handled or indicated on
  the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific labels or legends you''d like to be included or customized
  (e.g., specific font size, style)?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., time on
  the x-axis and crossing on the y-axis, or vice versa)?

  10. Would you like annotations or markers on high-traffic areas and times for better
  readability?'
