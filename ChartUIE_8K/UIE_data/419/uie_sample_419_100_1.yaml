initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing bike counts and pedestrian counts
  at different crossings in Seattle. The x-axis should represent time (dates), and
  the y-axis should represent bike and pedestrian counts. Use bubbles of different
  sizes or colors to distinguish between bike and pedestrian counts. Highlight times
  and crossings with the highest and lowest counts. Add text annotations to note significant
  data points or trends. The chart should help urban planners identify peak times
  for bike and pedestrian traffic, assisting in traffic management and infrastructure
  improvements. Include data from the specified time range for accurate analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between bike
  and pedestrian counts?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest counts to be highlighted (e.g., specific
  colors, larger bubble sizes)?

  3. Are there specific date formats you prefer for the x-axis?

  4. Do you have any preferred font sizes or styles for text annotations?

  5. Is there a particular range or scale you want the y-axis to adhere to?

  6. Would you like gridlines or background shading for better readability?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Larger bubble sizes for the highest counts and smaller bubble sizes for the lowest
  counts would be great.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be helpful for better readability.'
