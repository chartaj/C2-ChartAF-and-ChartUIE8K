initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize bike and pedestrian traffic at different
  times of the day for various crossings. Use the 'date' column to represent the time
  of day, and show data across different 'crossing' locations. 'bike_count' and 'ped_count'
  should be represented with varying colors to indicate density. Focus on high-traffic
  areas and times, highlighting trends or patterns. Ensure missing values do not skew
  the results. This will help in understanding and optimizing urban-planning for Seattle's
  green wave initiative. Use clear labels for times, crossings, and counts for readability.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for representing high, medium,
  and low densities?

  2. Is there a preferred color scheme for ''bike_count'' and ''ped_count'', or can
  they be the same?

  3. Would you like the time of day to be broken down into specific intervals (e.g.,
  hourly, every 30 minutes)?

  4. Should weekends and weekdays be shown separately, or can they be combined?

  5. Do you want any specific focus or emphasis on certain crossings or times of day?

  6. Would you prefer the heatmap to show absolute counts or normalized counts (e.g.,
  density relative to the maximum observed count)?

  7. Is there a preference for how missing values should be handled or indicated on
  the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific labels or legends you''d like to be included or customized
  (e.g., specific font size, style)?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., time on
  the x-axis and crossing on the y-axis, or vice versa)?

  10. Would you like annotations or markers on high-traffic areas and times for better
  readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Hourly intervals would be great.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Focus on high-traffic crossings and times, please.

  6. Absolute counts would be preferred.

  7. Please ensure missing values do not skew the results.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Time on the x-axis and crossing on the y-axis sounds good.

  10. Yes, annotations on high-traffic areas and times would help with readability.'
