initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing bike_count and ped_count data over
  time to highlight patterns and anomalies in Seattle's urban planning efforts. Annotate
  specific outliers and significant trends. Highlight key crossings to show areas
  with the highest activity levels. Use different colors to distinguish between bike
  and pedestrian counts, emphasizing the importance of each for city infrastructure
  planning. Include annotations to describe the observed trends and anomalies for
  better context and editorial insights. This will help in identifying areas requiring
  improvements and planning better for future urban infrastructure.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing bike and pedestrian
  counts?

  2. Do you prefer specific annotation styles for outliers and trends (e.g., text
  labels, arrows, highlighting)?

  3. Is there a particular way you would like key crossings to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different shapes, special colors)?

  4. What is your preferred layout for the box chart, such as vertical or horizontal
  orientation?

  5. Are there any specific time intervals you would like to focus on (e.g., yearly,
  monthly, daily)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background for better reference,
  and if so, do you have a preference for their style or color?

  7. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for annotations and labels?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between bike count and ped
  count, and if so, where would you like the legend to be positioned?

  9. Are there any specific crossings that you want to always be highlighted or focused
  on in the chart?

  10. Do you require any specific margin or spacing specifications around the chart
  for better readability?'
