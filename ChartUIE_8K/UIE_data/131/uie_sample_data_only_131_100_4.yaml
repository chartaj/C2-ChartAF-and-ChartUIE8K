02_initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the Mushroom Classification dataset.
  The treemap should illustrate the distribution of mushrooms based on cap-color,
  cap-shape, and odor, with color variations representing different values within
  each category. Use distinct shades for each unique value to ensure clarity. The
  size of each tile should correspond to the frequency of the values within that category
  to show their distribution. Ensure the plot is interactive and displays details
  when hovering over each tile, such as the count of mushrooms with particular features.
  The goal is to identify common patterns and rare attributes visually.
