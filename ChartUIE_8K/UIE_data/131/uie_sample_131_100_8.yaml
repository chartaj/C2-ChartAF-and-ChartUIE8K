initial_prompt: I'd like to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of mushrooms
  based on their cap color. Please use the data provided in the CSV file for the mushroom
  classification task. I am interested in understanding the frequency of each cap
  color category (e.g., how many mushrooms have a cap color of 'n', 'y', 'w', etc.).
  Make sure each bar represents a different cap color and shows the number of occurrences
  in the dataset. Ensure the histogram is clear and well-labeled with appropriate
  titles and axis labels.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors for each bar representing
  different cap colors?

  2. What title would you like for the histogram?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the x-axis label?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the y-axis label?

  5. Would you like the bars in the histogram to have any specific width or spacing?

  6. Do you have a preference for the display order of the cap colors (e.g., alphabetical,
  frequency)?

  7. What font type and size would you prefer for the labels and titles?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart''s background or gridlines
  (e.g., color, visibility)?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or labels you would like to include on the
  histogram?

  10. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal layout for the histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Mushroom Cap Color Distribution

  3. Cap Color

  4. Frequency

  5. I do not know.

  6. Frequency order would be nice.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No additional annotations are needed.

  10. Vertical layout'
