initial_prompt: I need a Radar chart visualizing the characteristics of different
  mushrooms for classification. Use the sample data provided, focusing on the attributes
  like 'cap-shape', 'cap-surface', 'cap-color', 'bruises', 'odor', etc. Plot individual
  attributes for three sample mushrooms, differentiating between 'edible' and 'poisonous'.
  Ensure all 23 attributes are well represented. Use different color codes or markers
  to distinguish between different classes ('e' and 'p') for clarity. Include legends
  and labels for better interpretation. The goal is to understand the distinguishing
  features between edible and poisonous mushrooms easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the specific colors used to distinguish
  between ''edible'' and ''poisonous'' mushrooms?

  2. Do you prefer specific markers to represent different classes (e.g., ''e'' for
  edible and ''p'' for poisonous)?

  3. Would you like to have any specific axis labels or annotations for clarity?

  4. Do you need any particular order for plotting the 23 attributes in the radar
  chart?

  5. Are there any specific legends or labels you prefer to be included for better
  interpretation?

  6. Should the radar chart include grid lines for easier comparison of attributes?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font style or size of the labels and legends?

  8. Would you prefer individual charts for each mushroom or a composite radar chart
  with all three mushrooms?'

  1. I do not have a specific preference for the colors used.

  2. I am not sure about the markers to represent different classes.

  3. Please include axis labels for clarity.

  4. I do not have any particular order for plotting the attributes.

  5. I am not sure about specific legends or labels.

  6. Yes, please include grid lines for easier comparison of attributes.

  7. I do not have any specific preference for the font style or size.

  8. A composite radar chart with all three mushrooms would be better.
