initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the mushroom classification
  data. Use the 'class' column to categorize the mushrooms (e for edible, p for poisonous).
  Stack the bars by 'cap-shape', with different segments representing unique 'odor'
  values. The x-axis should show 'cap-shape', and the y-axis should represent the
  count of mushrooms within each 'class'. Different colors in each bar should represent
  distinct 'odor' values. This visualization will help understand the distribution
  of odors among various cap shapes and their classification as edible or poisonous.
  Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different 'odor' segments?\n\
  2. Should there be specific colors designated for the 'class' categories of edible\
  \ and poisonous mushrooms?\n3. Do you want to include labels or values on the bars\
  \ to display the exact counts of mushrooms?\n4. Should the chart include a legend\
  \ to explain the color coding for 'odor' values?\n5. Would you like any specific\
  \ font styles or sizes for the axis labels and the legend?\n6. Do you want gridlines\
  \ on the chart for better readability, and if yes, should they be in a particular\
  \ style or color?\n7. Should there be any specific title or subtitle for the chart?\
  \ \n8. Would you like to include any source or footnotes for the data? \n9. Do you\
  \ have any preference for the formatting of the y-axis (e.g., scale, intervals)?"
