initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the unique values for each attribute
  in the Mushroom Classification dataset. Highlight and annotate key attributes like
  'odor' and 'gill-color' to emphasize their diversity. Use distinct colors to differentiate
  the bar segments.

  2. How would you like the annotations to be presented on the chart (e.g., text boxes,
  arrows pointing to bars)?

  on the x-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the labels and annotations?

  6. Do you need a legend to differentiate the colors used for different attributes?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the bar chart?

  8. Do you want any specific grid lines or background settings for the chart?

  9. Are there any additional attributes beyond ''odor'' and ''gill-color'' that you
