initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize data from the mushroom classification
  dataset. The x-axis should represent 'cap-color' and the y-axis should represent
  'odor'. The size of the bubbles should correspond to the frequency of different
  'gill-color' values. Itâ€™s important to also color-code the bubbles based on the
  'class' (poisonous or edible) of the mushrooms. This will help in identifying correlations
  between cap color, odor, and gill color in relation to whether the mushroom is poisonous
  or edible. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to represent the ''class''
  of mushrooms (poisonous and edible)?

  2. What range or scale would you prefer for the bubble sizes representing the frequency
  of different ''gill-color'' values?

  3. Should there be specific labels or annotations on the x-axis (''cap-color'')
  and y-axis (''odor'') for better readability?

  4. Do you have any preference for the chart''s title and axis labels'' font size
  and style?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for easier reference?

  6. Do you want a legend included, and if so, what should it specifically highlight?

  7. Are there any particular colors you would like the chart''s background and axes
  to be?

  8. How should the chart handle overlapping bubbles to ensure all data points are
  visible?

  9. Would you like to highlight any specific clusters or data points within the chart?

  10. How would you prefer the data tooltips to be displayed (e.g., minimal information
  vs. detailed)?'
