initial_prompt: Create a pie chart that visualizes the percentage of Agricultural
  Land for a selection of countries (e.g., Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria). Use the
  annotations to highlight specific percentages for these countries on the chart.
  This helps us understand the distribution of agricultural land among different nations.
  Ensure each segment is labeled with the country's name and its corresponding percentage.
  Additionally, we might want to highlight the country with the highest percentage
  to emphasize its dominance in agricultural land use.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart segments?

  2. Should the pie chart include a legend for country names and percentages, or do
  you prefer annotations directly on the segments?

  3. Are there any specific countries, aside from Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria,
  that you would like to include in the chart?

  4. How would you like the country with the highest percentage to be highlighted
  (e.g., different color, bold border, larger annotation)?

  5. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Annotations directly on the segments.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Different color.

  5. I am not sure.'
