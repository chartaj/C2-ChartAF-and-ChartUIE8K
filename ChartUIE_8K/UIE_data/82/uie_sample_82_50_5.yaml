initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the relationship between Birth Rate, Life
  expectancy, and Infant mortality for all countries. Use Birth Rate on the x-axis,
  Life Expectancy on the y-axis, and color intensity to represent Infant mortality.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for representing Infant mortality
  on the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a specific range for color intensity you would like to set for the
  heatmap?

  3. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight on the heatmap?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines or borders to distinguish the values more
  clearly on the heatmap?

  5. Is there any particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Should we include a legend to indicate the color intensity values for Infant
  mortality?

  7. Do you require any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to include data points or markers to further emphasize the Birth
  Rate and Life Expectancy values for each country?

  9. Should we add any additional reference lines or thresholds to highlight specific
  ranges for Birth Rate or Life Expectancy?'
