initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showcasing global data from the "Global Country
  Information Dataset 2023." Use "Population" data to determine the color gradient,
  highlighting countries with higher populations in darker shades. Include text annotations
  for countries with the top five highest and lowest populations. Incorporate highlights
  like country borders to distinguish individual nations. Add labels for "Country"
  and "Population" to provide context. This visualization should help identify population
  distribution trends, making it easier to analyze geographical population densities.
  Ensure the map is both informative and visually engaging to aid in data interpretation.
