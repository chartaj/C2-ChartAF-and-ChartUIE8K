initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap of life expectancies across different
  countries using latitude and longitude data. Color the countries by life expectancy
  values to visualize global disparities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., sequential,
  diverging, or a specific color palette)?

  2. Would you like to include a legend explaining the life expectancy values?

  3. Should the map display country borders or regions for better geographical context?

  4. Do you want to include tooltips showing detailed data like country name and exact
  life expectancy on hover?

  5. What geographic projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson, etc.) do you prefer for
  the map?

  6. Is there a specific range of life expectancy values you want to focus on or highlight?

  7. Would you like to display additional geographic markers or labels (e.g., capital
  cities) on the map?

  8. Do you need any annotations or callouts on specific countries to highlight notable
  disparities?

  9. Should the heatmap include data normalization for better visual comparison across
  countries?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the map''s background (e.g., light, dark, satellite
  view)?'
