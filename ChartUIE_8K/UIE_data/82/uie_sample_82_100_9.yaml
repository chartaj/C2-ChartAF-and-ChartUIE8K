initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the birth rate trends of different
  countries over time from the Global Country Information Dataset 2023. The x-axis
  should represent the countries, and the y-axis should represent the birth rate.
  Include data points for Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria to start. Highlight the
  differences between these countries clearly. Each country should have a different
  colored line for distinction. The chart should be simple and easy to understand
  for general users. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors to be used for each country?

  4. Do you have any specific title in mind for the chart?

  5. Should there be any additional labels or annotations on certain data points?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?
