initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to compare the GDP of different countries listed
  in the dataset. Use the 'Country' column for the x-axis and the 'GDP' column for
  the y-axis. Also, add data labels to each bar so that the exact GDP figures are
  visible. Ensure the chart title is "GDP Comparison of Countries" and the y-axis
  title is "GDP in USD". Include a legend even if only one dataset is used, for clarity.
  Highlight bars in different colors for visual distinction. Lastly, ensure the y-axis
  values are formatted in a way to accurately represent the large numbers.
