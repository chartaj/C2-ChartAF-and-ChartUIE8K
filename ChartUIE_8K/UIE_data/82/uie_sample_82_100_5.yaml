initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the Birth Rate, Fertility Rate, Infant
  mortality, and Life expectancy for all countries in the 'Global Country Information
  Dataset 2023'. Normalize each column to allow comparison across different scales,
  and encode the heatmap colors to highlight higher and lower values distinctly. Use
  the 'Country' column as the categorical axis, and plot the relevant data columns
  as the continuous axis to show the relationship between these population health
  indicators across different countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include specific labels or annotations for critical values?

  3. Do you have a preference for the range of colors used to represent normalized
  data values?

  4. Would you like to include a legend or color bar to explain the color encoding?

  5. Is there a specific font or style you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Should the data normalization follow a specific method (e.g., min-max scaling,
  z-score standardization)?

  7. How would you like the countries to be sorted on the categorical axis (alphabetically,
  by a specific indicator, etc.)?

  8. Do you have any preference for the resolution or granularity of the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include a legend or color bar to explain the color encoding.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Please use min-max scaling for the data normalization.

  7. Sort the countries alphabetically.

  8. I do not have any preference for the resolution or granularity.'
