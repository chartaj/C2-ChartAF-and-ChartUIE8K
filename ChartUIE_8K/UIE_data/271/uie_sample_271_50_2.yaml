initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of 'cnt' values for
  each 'airport1'. Highlight outliers and use text annotations to indicate high-traffic
  airports. Emphasize comparing flight counts from different starting airports to
  understand travel patterns.

  font type, color)?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g.,
  color change, different markers)?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  6. Should the axis labels have a particular format or style?

  7. Do you want the high-traffic airports'' text annotations to include any specific
  information besides the airport name?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the box chart?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  10. Do you want any specific data points to be emphasized or highlighted apart from
  the outliers and high-traffic airports?'
