initial_prompt: '"Please create a Choropleth map visualizing the flight connections
  data from the provided CSV. The map should show flight routes from the start coordinates
  (start_lat, start_lon) to the end coordinates (end_lat, end_lon). Each route should
  represent the airline''s flight data with a color gradient based on the ''cnt''
  (number of flights). Ensure you include airport information (airport1, airport2)
  and use a suitable color scheme to differentiate clearly between high and low traffic
  routes. This should help us understand flight traffic distribution and density."'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the ''cnt'' (number of flights)
  to represent traffic density?

  2. Should the map include any specific geographic boundaries or regions of interest?

  3. Do you prefer any specific styling elements for the map, such as borders or labels
  for the routes?

  4. How detailed should the airport information (airport1, airport2) be displayed
  on the map?

  5. Would you like to include additional data layers, such as base maps or geographic
  features, for context?

  6. Should any additional annotations or legends be included on the map to improve
  clarity?

  7. Are there any specific map projections you prefer?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color gradient.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Please display the airport names clearly.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, include a legend to explain the color gradient for clarity.

  7. I do not know.'
