initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot highlighting the routes flown by airline AA.
  Emphasize the start and end latitudes and longitudes to visualize travel paths between
  different airports. Include annotations for the start and end airports, especially
  where the 'cnt' values are highest, to showcase the most frequented routes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme or style of the scatter
  plot?

  2. Do you prefer any specific shapes for the start and end points on the scatter
  plot?

  3. How would you like the annotations for the start and end airports to be displayed
  (e.g., size, position, font)?

  4. Would you like the size or color of the points to reflect the ''cnt'' values?

  5. Is there a particular background map you would prefer to use for the geographical
  context?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, what information should it display?

  7. Would you like gridlines or any other specific chart elements (e.g., axis labels,
  titles)?'
