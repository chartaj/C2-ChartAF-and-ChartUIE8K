initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart that shows the number of flights
  ('cnt') per airline ('airline') along different routes. Group the routes based on
  the starting airport ('airport1') and ending airport ('airport2'). This will help
  visualize how many flights each airline operates between various pairs of airports.
  Make sure each column represents one route, with different segments of the column
  stacked to show different airlines. This visualization will provide insight into
  travel patterns and airline operations for different routes. Use the travel data
  details to guide the design.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked column chart to
  differentiate between airlines?

  2. Would you like the airports to be displayed with their full names or just their
  IATA codes?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color represents each airline?

  4. Do you prefer the columns to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., by airport
  pairs, by total number of flights)?

  5. Do you want to include data labels on each segment of the columns to show the
  exact number of flights?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability or leave them out for
  a cleaner look?

  7. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the chart to provide
  additional context?

  8. Is there a preference for the font style or size for the labels and axis titles?

  9. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so, how would you like them to be
  labeled?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. The IATA codes are fine.

  3. Yes, please include a legend.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include data labels on each segment.

  6. I do not know.

  7. "Flights per Airline on Various Routes" as the title would be good.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please label the y-axis as "Number of Flights" and the x-axis as "Routes
  (Airport1 - Airport2)".'
