initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of flight counts
  ('cnt') for airline 'AA' from different origin airports ('airport1') to various
  destination airports ('airport2'). Add text annotations to highlight the mean and
  median flight counts. Use different colors to differentiate each airport route and
  add highlights to emphasize routes with significantly higher or lower counts. The
  visualization aims to identify the busiest and least busy routes. Also, include
  annotations to provide context about the significance of these routes for travel
  planning and decision-making.
