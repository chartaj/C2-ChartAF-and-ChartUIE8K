2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of flight counts ('cnt') across
  different routes. Highlight the range and central tendency of the data, annotating
  the airlines and airports involved. Ensure to emphasize significant variances within
  the data. The goal is to understand the concentration and spread of flight counts
  and identify trends in travel routes and airline activity. Use text annotations
  to highlight key data points and enhance readability. This visualization will aid
  in identifying popular travel routes and airlines operating those routes efficiently.
