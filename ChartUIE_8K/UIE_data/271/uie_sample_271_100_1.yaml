initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing travel data between airports. Use
  start_lat and start_lon for the starting point, and end_lat and end_lon for the
  destination. Plot data points for each flight route, with color highlighting distinguishing
  different destination airports. Annotate the airline code and number of flights
  (cnt) on the scatter points to focus on high-traffic routes. This visualization
  serves to identify key routes and airline activities clearly, focusing on travel
  patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  distinguish different destination airports?

  2. Would you prefer any specific annotation style or font for the airline code and
  the number of flights (cnt)?

  3. Should the scatter plot include any specific markers or shapes for the data points?

  4. Do you prefer the plot to have gridlines or a specific background color?

  5. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you would like for the scatter plot?

  6. Do you want to specify the range or limits for the x-axis (start_lon) and y-axis
  (start_lat, end_lat, end_lon)?

  7. Should the scatter plot include a legend to explain the colors used for different
  destination airports?

  8. Would you like to include any specific title or labels for the axes?

  9. Do you have a preference for the format of annotations (for example, airline
  code and number of flights)?

  10. Are there any specific destination airports or flight routes you want to emphasize
  or highlight further?'
