initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the penguin dataset from the given
  CSV file. The heatmap should show the distribution of different penguin species
  across the three islands mentioned (Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream). Use varying colors
  to represent species and intensity to show body mass. Also, highlight the average
  bill length and flipper length for penguins on each island. Ensure to indicate the
  missing values for the bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and sex.
  This will help in visualizing the penguin populations effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing the different
  species?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be indicated on the heatmap (e.g., specific
  symbols, colors)?

  3. Should the heatmap display a legend for the intensity of body mass?

  4. How would you prefer the average bill length and flipper length to be highlighted
  on each island (e.g., text labels, markers)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the geographical representation of the islands
  (e.g., specific map style or projection)?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you would like to
  be included on the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the label formats or scales for the measurable
  attributes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should display a legend for the intensity of body mass.

  4. Text labels would be preferable for highlighting the average bill length and
  flipper length on each island.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No, I have no specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.'
