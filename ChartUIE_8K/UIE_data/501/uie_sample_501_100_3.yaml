initial_prompt: I have a dataset on penguins from different islands including their
  species, bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. I would
  like to visualize the distribution of penguin species across the islands using a
  pie chart. Each slice of the pie should represent a different species, and the size
  of each slice should correspond to the number of penguins of that species on each
  island. This will help me understand the species diversity on each island better.
  Could you create this pie chart for me?
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display percentages or actual counts in the slices?

  3. Should the pie chart have labels directly on the slices, or would you prefer
  a legend?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the species to be arranged
  in the pie chart?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the labels and title?

  6. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, do you have specific text
  in mind?

  7. Would you like to include any specific annotations or descriptions on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color?

  9. Should the slices be separated or have gaps between them (exploded view)?

  10. Would you like to add any additional elements, such as grid lines or borders,
  to the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the chart to display actual counts if possible.

  3. I prefer labels directly on the slices.

  4. I do not have any specific order in mind.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, the chart should include a title. The title could be "Penguin Species Distribution
  Across Islands".

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No, the slices should not be separated.

  10. I do not have any specific preferences for additional elements.'
