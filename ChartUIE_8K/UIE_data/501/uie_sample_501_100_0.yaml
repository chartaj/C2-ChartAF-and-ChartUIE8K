initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the average body mass of penguin species
  across different islands. Highlight the bars based on species, and use text annotations
  to show the exact average body mass values. This will help quickly identify which
  species are heaviest or lightest. Include data on missing values for context. This
  visualization will give insights into physical characteristics variation by location
  and gender discrepancies, aiding in zoological studies. Make this chart with annotations
  that both highlight and describe key data points, helping to focus the viewer's
  attention effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the bars based
  on species?

  2. Would you like the average body mass values to be displayed inside the bars or
  above them?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to denote species colors, or would you prefer
  labels on the bars themselves?

  4. How would you like missing values to be represented in the chart?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines for easier comparison, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  7. Would you like to include error bars or any indication of variability around
  the average body mass values?

  8. Are there any specific titles or axis labels you would like to use for the chart?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chartâ€™s layout or orientation (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical bars)?'
