initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap of penguin species distribution across
  islands. Use species and island columns for location data. Highlight density using
  bill_length_mm and body_mass_g values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to represent different
  species?

  2. Should there be a specific range of colors to indicate varying densities?

  3. Would you like the map to include labels for each island?

  4. Do you prefer a legend that shows the bill length and body mass as separate density
  measures or combined?

  5. Should the heatmap be displayed with geographic boundaries such as the coastline
  of islands?

  6. Would you like markers or annotations for specific data points with extreme values?

  7. Do you have a specific map projection preference (e.g., Mercator, Albers)?

  8. Should the size of the heatmap markers vary based on the density?

  9. Is there a specific background style for the map you prefer (e.g., satellite,
  terrain)?'
