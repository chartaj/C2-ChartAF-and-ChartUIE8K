initial_prompt: I want to create a box chart to visualize the distribution of penguin
  body masses across different species. The box chart should have species on the x-axis
  and body mass (g) on the y-axis. Ensure the chart highlights the median, quartiles,
  and potential outliers. Given the missing values in the dataset, include a note
  addressing the handling of those gaps. Please ensure the data visualization is clear
  and accurately represents the variations in body mass for each species. Provide
  any additional insights or trends observed from the data if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like grid lines to be included for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include annotations highlighting the median, quartiles, and
  outliers?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  5. Do you want the chart to display individual data points or only the summary statistics
  (median, quartiles, whiskers)?

  6. How should the missing values be handled or annotated in the chart?

  7. Would you like any additional statistics or trends to be noted directly on the
  chart?

  8. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the box chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like grid lines to be included for better readability.

  3. Yes, the chart should include annotations highlighting the median, quartiles,
  and outliers.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Please include a note mentioning how the missing values have been handled.

  7. Yes, highlight any notable statistics or trends observed from the data directly
  on the chart.

  8. I prefer a vertical orientation for the box chart.'
