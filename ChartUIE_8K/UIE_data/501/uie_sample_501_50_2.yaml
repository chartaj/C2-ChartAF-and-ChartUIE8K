initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing penguin body mass against flipper
  length, differentiated by species and sex. Highlight outliers. Annotate the highest
  body mass point per species. This will help in understanding the variation in body
  structure among different penguin species.

  species and sex?

  2. Would you like to specify any custom labels for the axes?

  3. Should the outliers be displayed with a specific marker or color?

  4. Do you have a preferred marker style for different species or sexes?

  5. Would you like to include a legend? If so, should it display species, sex, or

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Should grid lines be included in the chart? If yes, do you have a preference
