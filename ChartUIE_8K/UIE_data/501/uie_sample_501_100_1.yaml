initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart showing the evolution of penguin body mass
  over different years, color-coded by species found on different islands. Include
  data-driven text annotations for significant data points, such as maximum and minimum
  body mass for different species. Highlight these points using different colors or
  markers for easy identification. Add context-driven annotations for each year to
  provide additional information, such as notable environmental changes or study interventions
  affecting body mass. The aim is to analyze trends and gain insight into how different
  species' body masses have changed over time and across different islands.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating between species
  and islands?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the type of markers used to highlight
  significant data points (e.g., shapes or sizes)?

  3. Would you like the significant data points (maximum and minimum body mass) to
  be labeled on the chart, and if so, how would you prefer the labels to be displayed?

  4. Are there any specific styles or fonts you prefer for the annotations?

  5. How would you like context-driven annotations to be displayed (e.g., in tooltips,
  callout boxes, or inline text)?

  6. Are there specific environmental changes or study interventions that you want
  to be explicitly noted in the annotations for each year?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or aspect ratio of the line chart?

  8. Would you like any specific gridlines or axis styling to be included or excluded
  from the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, I would like the significant data points to be labeled on the chart. The
  labels should be displayed clearly with arrows pointing to the points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Callout boxes would be good for the context-driven annotations.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I do not know.'
