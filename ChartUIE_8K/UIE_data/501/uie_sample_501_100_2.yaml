initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot illustrating the relationship between bill length
  and bill depth for different penguin species. Highlight outliers and add text annotations
  for data points with missing values in bill length and bill depth. Ensure the species,
  sex, and year data are reflected via different colors and shapes. This visualization
  will help infer trends and differences across species, aiding in zoological studies.
  Include a legend and title to make the chart self-explanatory.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different species, sex,
  and year?

  2. What shapes would you like to represent the different sex categories?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., with a specific color,
  shape, or border)?

  4. Do you have any specific text annotation format or style preference for marking
  missing values?

  5. Is there a specific layout or arrangement you prefer for the legend?

  6. Do you have any preference for the title text and style for the scatter plot?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot, and if so, do
  you have any style preferences for them?

  8. Should there be axis labels, and do you have any specific format or text you
  would prefer for them?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the size of the data points or the overall size
  of the scatter plot?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the annotations,
  legend, or title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Highlight outliers with a specific border color.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I do not have a specific layout preference for the legend.

  6. The title could be "Penguin Bill Length vs. Bill Depth Across Species".

  7. Yes, display grid lines, but I am not sure about the style preferences.

  8. Yes, please include axis labels. "Bill Length (mm)" for the x-axis and "Bill
  Depth (mm)" for the y-axis.

  9. I have no specific preference for the size of data points or the overall size
  of the scatter plot.

  10. I am not sure.'
