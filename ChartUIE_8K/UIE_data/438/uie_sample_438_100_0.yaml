initial_prompt: I need a choropleth map to visualize coffee ratings by country of
  origin from the dataset. Highlight countries with the highest average total cup
  points to show top coffee producers visually. Add text annotations for countries
  with the highest and lowest average ratings for emphasis. Include hover tooltips
  for additional data such as species, processing method, and farm name to provide
  more context. This visualization will help identify high-quality coffee-producing
  regions and could be valuable for coffee enthusiasts and professionals.

  map?'
