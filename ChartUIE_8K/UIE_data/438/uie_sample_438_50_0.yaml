initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing coffee ratings by country of origin.
  Highlight regions with the highest total cup points. Add annotations for the top

  more prominently?

  4. How would you like the annotations for the top three countries to be displayed?
  (e.g., text size, color, positioning)

  5. Would you prefer the map to display additional geographic labels or features
  apart from the countries?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you want to use for the text in the visualizations?

  7. How detailed should the unique flavors be displayed in the annotations? (e.g.,
  list of flavors or summarized description)

  8. Should the map include a legend explaining the color coding?

  9. Do you have a preference for the map projection to be used in the visualization?
