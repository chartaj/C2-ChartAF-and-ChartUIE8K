initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize coffee ratings by country
  of origin. Highlight countries with highest total cup points and annotate with average
  scores of aroma, flavor, and acidity. Use color gradients to distinguish regions,
  emphasizing top-rated areas. Include contextual annotations for outliers and notable
  entries. This will help identify the best coffee-producing regions globally, making
  it easier to understand quality distribution. Include specific regions and producers
  where available to add depth to the map. Also, highlight any significant variances
  within countries to provide a comprehensive view of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the country boundaries be emphasized with borders?

  3. Are there specific regions or producers that you want to be highlighted prominently?

  4. Do you want the annotations for outliers and notable entries to appear as tooltips
  or fixed labels?

  5. What level of opacity would you like for the color gradients?

  6. Should the map include labels for countries, regions, or both?

  7. Do you prefer a specific projection type for the geographic map?

  8. How detailed do you want the contextual annotations for significant variances
  within countries to be?

  9. Would you like to include a legend or color bar to explain the color gradients?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for text annotations and labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, emphasize country boundaries with borders.
