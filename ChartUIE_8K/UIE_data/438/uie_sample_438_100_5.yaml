initial_prompt: I have coffee ratings dataset from '../Extra_datas/data/438.csv' focused
  on 'food-and-drink'. I need to visualize the distribution of different coffee attributes
  like aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body, and balance. Create a box chart for
  each of these attributes. Ensure each box chart displays the median, quartiles,
  and outliers. Having different colors for each box will help in distinguishing them.
  This visualization will assist in understanding the variation and quality of coffee
  ratings. Please label the axes clearly and ensure the chart is easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different box charts?

  2. How many colors would you like to use to distinguish the box charts?

  3. Would you like any specific labels for the chart titles or axis labels?

  4. Do you want to include any specific annotations or comments in the charts?

  5. What font size and style would you prefer for the labels and titles?

  6. Should the charts be displayed in any specific order?

  7. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the charts?

  8. Do you require gridlines or axes to be styled in a particular way?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the charts?

  10. Should the whiskers in the box plots extend to show the full range of the data
  or only to 1.5 * IQR?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I think 6 different colors, one for each attribute, should be good.

  3. Title: "Distribution of Coffee Attributes"; X-axis: "Attributes"; Y-axis: "Ratings"

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure about font size and style, something standard and readable is fine.

  6. I have no specific preference for the order of charts.

  7. I am not sure about the size or aspect ratio.

  8. I am not sure about the gridlines or axes style.

  9. I do not know about the background color.

  10. Show the whiskers only to 1.5 * IQR.'
