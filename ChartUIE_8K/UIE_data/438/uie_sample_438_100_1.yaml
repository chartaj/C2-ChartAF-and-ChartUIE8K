initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing coffee ratings. Display total
  cup points and its sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, aftertaste, acidity, body,
  balance, uniformity, clean cup, sweetness) for each sample. Utilize colors to distinguish
  different attributes and include data-driven text annotations for highlighting specific
  ratings. This helps in comparing the overall quality and specific characteristics
  of different coffee samples effectively. Highlight the samples with the highest
  and lowest total cup points to draw attention to them. The chart aims to provide
  a quick visual comparison of the sensory profiles of coffee samples from various
  origins and producers.
