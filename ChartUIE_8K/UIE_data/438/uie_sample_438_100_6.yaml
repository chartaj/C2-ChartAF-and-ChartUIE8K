initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of coffee
  varieties and their corresponding cup points from the provided coffee ratings dataset.
  Highlight the proportion of each variety in the dataset and use a color gradient
  to represent the total cup points scored by each variety. For missing values, please
  exclude them to ensure accurate representation. Additionally, please include labels
  on the segments to indicate both the coffee variety and the percentage of the total
  they represent.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the color gradient representing
  the total cup points?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font type or size for the labels on the segments?

  3. Would you like the donut chart to have a specific degree of hole size (inner
  radius relative to the outer radius)?

  4. Do you want any specific order for arranging the coffee varieties, such as alphabetically
  or by their proportion?

  5. Should the chart include a legend or tooltip to provide additional information
  about the coffee varieties and their total cup points?

  6. Do you have a preferred background color for the chart?

  7. Would you like to show exact numerical values for percentages and total cup points
  on the labels, or just the percentages?'
