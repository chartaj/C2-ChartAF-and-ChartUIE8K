  descriptions from the Data Science Interview Questions dataset. The x-axis should
  represent unique IDs, and the y-axis should show the corresponding descriptions.
  Utilize text annotations on the top three most frequent descriptions to highlight
  them. This will help in understanding which topics are most commonly discussed.
  Additionally, use color highlights to make these top descriptions stand out visually.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
