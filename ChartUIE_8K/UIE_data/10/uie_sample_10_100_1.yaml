initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart displaying the frequency of different descriptions
  from the Data Science Interview Questions dataset. The x-axis should represent unique
  IDs, and the y-axis should show the corresponding descriptions. Utilize text annotations
  on the top three most frequent descriptions to highlight them. This will help in
  understanding which topics are most commonly discussed. Additionally, use color
  highlights to make these top descriptions stand out visually. Make sure to include
  labels for clarity. This will help in quickly identifying key interview topics.

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall size (width and height)
  of the chart?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart? If yes, where should it
  be positioned?'
