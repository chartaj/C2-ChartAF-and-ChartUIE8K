initial_prompt: Create a word cloud using the 'DESCRIPTION' column to visualize the
  frequency of words from data science interview questions. Highlight keywords like
  "padding," "Sigmoid," "Softmax," and "PoS Tagging" to draw attention to prominent
  topics. This visualization will help in understanding common themes and important
  concepts frequently discussed in interview questions. Ensure the chart distinguishes
  significant words effectively to provide clear insights into the focus areas of
  data science and analytics interview content. Use text annotations to provide additional
  context for highlighted terms within the word cloud.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the word cloud?

  2. How would you like the highlighted keywords to be visually distinguished (e.g.,
  font size, font color, background color)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style for the word cloud?

  4. What size do you envision for the text annotations providing additional context
  for highlighted terms?

  5. Are there any other keywords, apart from "padding," "Sigmoid," "Softmax," and
  "PoS Tagging," that you would like to highlight?

  6. Would you like the word cloud to have any particular shape (e.g., circular, rectangular,
  or any thematic shape)?

  7. Should the word frequency impact only the size of the words, or would you like
  it to impact other attributes as well (e.g., color intensity)?

  8. Do you have a preference for how dense or sparse the word cloud should appear?

  9. Are there any specific words you would like to exclude from the word cloud?

  10. Would you like a specific background color for the word cloud?'
