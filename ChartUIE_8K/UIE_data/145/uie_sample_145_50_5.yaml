  countries with different colors based on age-standardized suicide rates per 100,000
  population, split by sex (Male, Female, Both sexes).

  be positioned (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  or other geographical markers?

  7. Should we include any specific annotations or callouts for countries with particularly
  high or low suicide rates?

  options?

  10. Are there any specific sources or citations you would like to be mentioned on
