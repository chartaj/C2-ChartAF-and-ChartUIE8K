initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the age-standardized suicide
  rates (per 100,000 population) from 2000 to 2019 across different countries. Use
  the 'Location' column for country names and 'FactValueNumeric' for the suicide rates.
  The color intensity should correspond to the suicide rate value, with higher rates
  showing darker shades. Add a legend to indicate the value ranges.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the choropleth map?

  2. How would you like the legend to be displayed (e.g., vertical or horizontal,
  specific number of bins)?

  3. Should the map display country labels or tooltips for additional information?

  4. Are there specific regions or countries you want to highlight?

  5. Do you prefer a specific map projection?

  6. How would you like to handle missing data in the visualization (e.g., use a specific
  color or exclude)?

  7. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the map?'
