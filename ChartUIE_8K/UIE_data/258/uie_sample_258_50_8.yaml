initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlation among all variables (id,
  V1-V24, Class) in the Wall Following Robot Navigation dataset. Highlight patterns
  and relationships.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preference for the scale of correlation coefficients (e.g., -1
  to 1)?

  3. Would you like to include exact correlation coefficient values in the heatmap
  cells?

  4. How would you like to handle the ''id'' variable in the correlation heatmap?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the variables to be arranged in the heatmap?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to show both rows and columns for each variable, or
  just columns?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the heatmap?

  8. Are there any particular visual features you want to be highlighted (e.g., strong
  correlations)?

  9. Do you prefer grid lines between heatmap cells?

  10. Do you have a preference for the size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?'
