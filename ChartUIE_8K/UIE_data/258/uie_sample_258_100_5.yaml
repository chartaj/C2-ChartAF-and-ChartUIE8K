initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the Wall Following Robot
  Navigation Dataset. Use the 'Class' column to differentiate the stacks. For the
  columns, select V4, V8, V12, V16, and V20 variables. Each stack should represent
  different classes. Title the chart as "Robot Navigation Metrics by Class" and label
  the axes appropriately. Use different colors for different classes to make the chart
  visually appealing and easy to understand. Ensure the chart reflects the trends
  and variations across different variables and classes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for different classes?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the title, axis labels, and legend?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the data?

  4. Should the chart include data labels for each segment in the stacks?

  5. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Would you prefer a specific range or scale for the y-axis?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include in
  the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the order in which the classes should be stacked?'
