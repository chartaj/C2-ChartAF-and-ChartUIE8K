initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to display the average values of V1 to
  V24 for different Class categories. Highlight the bars with different colors based
  on their Class values. Annotate the highest value in each group for clarity. This
  helps to understand how each variable varies across different classes. Use different
  shades for distinction. Add text annotations to the highlighted bars to show exact
  values. This chart provides insights into robotics data patterns and class distinctions.
  Please ensure labels and legends are clear for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for distinguishing the different
  Class categories?

  2. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and legends?

  3. Where would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the format or style of the text annotations on the
  highlighted bars?

  5. Should the bars have any specific width or spacing between them?

  6. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart for easier interpretation, and if so, should
  they be dotted or solid lines?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or subtitle? If yes, please
  provide the exact text.

  8. Are there any specific requirements for the dimensions or aspect ratio of the
  chart?'
