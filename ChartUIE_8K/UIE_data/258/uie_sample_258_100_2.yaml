  Create a line chart visualizing the Wall Following Robot Navigation Dataset. Highlight
  V1 and V2 columns to distinguish their trends over time, focusing on any significant
  changes. Add text annotations to key points, showing their values, especially where
  the trend changes direction. This chart will help understand the robot''s navigation
  behavior. Ensure that the appearance is clear and emphasizes critical data elements
  for better insight.
