initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between sensor
  readings and the class of wall-following robot navigation. Use 'V3' for the x-axis,
  'V6' for the y-axis, and color-code the points based on the 'Class' column to differentiate
  the navigation outcomes. Include appropriate labels and a legend. Ensure the visualization
  clearly shows the clustering of different classes to help understand how the sensor
  readings influence robot navigation and identify patterns or outliers among the
  classes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the classes?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the scatter plot?

  3. Should we use specific markers or shapes for the different classes?

  4. Do you have any preference for the font size and style of the labels?

  5. Would you like the legend to be placed in a specific location on the plot?

  6. Do you want to include axis titles, and if so, do you have specific wording for
  them?

  7. Should the plot include a title, and if so, do you have a preferred title in
  mind?

  8. Would you like to add any reference lines (such as mean or median) on the scatter
  plot?

  9. Do you want to adjust the axis limits manually or let them be auto-scaled based
  on the data?

  10. Are there any specific annotations you would like to add to highlight important
  points or clusters?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, include axis titles. For the x-axis: ''Sensor V3'', for the y-axis: ''Sensor
  V6''.

  7. Yes, title it ''Wall-Following Robot Navigation''.
