initial_prompt: Using the Wall Following Robot Navigation Dataset for a heatmap, plot
  the correlation matrix for all variables (V1-V24) to understand their relationships.
  Highlight particularly strong correlations with different color intensities. Ensure
  that axis labels are clear and readable, and each variable is represented. This
  will help in identifying which sensors (variables) have the strongest influence
  or relationships with others during the robot's navigation. Make sure to note any
  high correlation that could indicate redundancy or critical interaction between
  sensors. The heatmap will aid in visual analysis of the sensor data interdependencies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use specific color intensities or gradients to highlight strong correlations?

  3. Is there a preferred color to represent high correlation specifically?

  4. Do you want to include annotations on each cell to show the correlation values?

  5. How would you like negative correlations to be displayed, in terms of color?

  6. Do you prefer the heatmap to be displayed with grid lines separating the cells?

  7. What size and orientation do you prefer for the axis labels (e.g., rotated, angled)?

  8. Should there be a legend included to explain the color intensities and their
  corresponding correlation values?

  9. Do you want to display a title or description on the heatmap to help contextualize
  the data?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, using specific color intensities or gradients to highlight strong correlations
  would be good.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the color to represent high correlation.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, having grid lines separating the cells would be helpful.

  7. I prefer the axis labels to be angled for better readability.

  8. Yes, including a legend to explain the color intensities and their corresponding
  correlation values would be useful.

  9. I do not have a specific preference.
