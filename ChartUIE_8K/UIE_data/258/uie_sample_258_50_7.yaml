initial_prompt: I'd like a column chart visualizing the unique values count of each
  column from the Wall Following Robot Navigation Dataset. This will help me understand
  the variability within each column. Could you show this with the variable names
  on the x-axis and the count of unique values on the y-axis? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed with specific spacing or width?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you want the axis labels to have any specific orientation (e.g., vertical,
  diagonal)?

  7. Would you like to display the exact count of unique values on top of each bar?'
