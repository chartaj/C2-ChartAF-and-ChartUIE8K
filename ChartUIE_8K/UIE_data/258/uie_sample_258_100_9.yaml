initial_prompt: I have data from a robot navigation dataset with various attributes.
  I want to create a bar chart that illustrates the distribution of unique values
  for each attribute (V1 to V24). Each bar should represent one attribute, showing
  the count of unique values. This will help understand the variability and complexity
  of the data captured by the robot sensors in different conditions. Please ensure
  the x-axis has the attribute names (V1, V2, etc.) and the y-axis shows the count
  of unique values. Include a legend to differentiate bars.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference on the color scheme for the bars?

  2. Would you like to include specific labels or annotations on the bars to indicate
  the counts more clearly?

  3. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal bar chart?

  4. Is there a specific order you prefer for the attributes on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ascending, descending, or custom order)?

  5. Should there be any specific gridlines or axis ticks for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font style and size of the axis labels and
  legend?

  7. Would you like to display the chart title? If so, do you have a preferred title?

  8. Do you want to include any additional text descriptions or notes on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include specific labels or annotations on the bars to indicate the
  counts more clearly.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include specific gridlines or axis ticks for better readability.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, I would like to display the chart title. The preferred title is "Distribution
  of Unique Values for Each Attribute".

  8. I do not know.'
