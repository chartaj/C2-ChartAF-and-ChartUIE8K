  4. Are there any specific axis titles or labels you would like to use for the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  you prefer the legend to be placed?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the bar width or spacing between the bars?

  7. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range, or should it be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?
