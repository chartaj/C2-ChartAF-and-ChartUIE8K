initial_prompt: Please create a column chart using the Wall Following Robot Navigation
  Dataset. I would like the chart to display the average values of V1 through V24
  for each class. Each column should represent a variable (V1, V2, etc.) and be grouped
  by the class labels on the x-axis. The height of each column should indicate the
  average value of that variable for a specific class. This will help visualize the
  distribution and comparison of sensor readings across different classes in the dataset.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different classes?

  2. Do you have a preference for the order of variables (V1, V2, etc.) on the x-axis?

  3. Should there be a specific range for the y-axis values?

  4. Would you like to add data labels on top of each column?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and axis titles?

  6. Should there be a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be placed?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, for which axis?

  8. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  9. Should there be any specific annotations or markers on the chart to highlight
  key points?

  10. Is there a specific background color or theme you would like for the chart?'
