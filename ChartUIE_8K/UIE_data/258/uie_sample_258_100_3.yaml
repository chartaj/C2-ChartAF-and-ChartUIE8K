initial_prompt: I'd like a dot plot visualization for the Wall Following Robot Navigation
  Dataset. Use various V columns (V1-V24) as datasets along the x-axis, and plot their
  values on the y-axis. Each type of V column should be represented by a distinct
  color. Additionally, differentiate the 'Class' categories using different dot shapes
  or sizes. This will help in understanding the relationship and distribution of the
  variables in robot navigation. A clear legend that marks each V column and Class
  would be helpful for interpretation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to represent
  different V columns?

  2. Would you like certain classes to have specific shapes or sizes of dots?

  3. Do you have a preferred method for arranging the x-axis?

  4. Are there any specific V columns that you would like to highlight more prominently?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like the legend to be displayed?

  8. Would you prefer a specific style or theme for the overall appearance of the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure, maybe just different shapes for each class would be enough.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have any specific columns to highlight.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be great for better readability.

  6. I do not have any specific requirements for the axis labels.

  7. A clear and simple legend that shows which color and shape represent each V column
  and class would be good.

  8. I am not sure, as long as it is clear and easy to understand.'
