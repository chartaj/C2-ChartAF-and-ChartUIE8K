initial_prompt: I need a line chart for the "Supermart Grocery Sales" dataset. Plot
  "Sales" and "Profit" on the y-axis against "Order Date" on the x-axis. Visualize
  trends over time by region or by category. The goal is to see how sales and profits
  change over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for displaying the different regions
  or categories?

  2. Would you like the sales and profit lines to be displayed in different styles
  (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  3. How would you like the axes to be labeled? Any specific format for the date on
  the x-axis?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines representing sales
  and profit?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the chart include data markers (dots) for each data point on the lines?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend indicating the lines for sales, profit,
  and respective regions or categories?

  8. Should there be a title and subtitles on the chart? If yes, do you have any specific
  wording in mind?

  9. What time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) would you like to use for
  the x-axis?

  10. Are there any specific regions or categories you want to highlight or focus
  on within the chart?

  11. Would you like trend lines or moving averages to be included to smooth out the
  data for better trend visualization?

  12. Any specific range or limits you want to set for the y-axis?'
