initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of sales across
  different regions from the Supermart Grocery Sales dataset. Make sure to highlight
  the frequency of sales amounts in each region. Additionally, include a separate
  histogram for profit to see how profit distribution varies across regions. Ensure
  that both histograms are easy to compare by using consistent color schemes and legends.
  The goal is to understand which regions have higher sales and profit concentrations.
  Please use clear labels and titles for better comprehension. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  histograms?

  2. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like to use for the histograms?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the bin size or range for the histogram?

  5. How would you like the legend to be displayed?

  6. Should the histograms be displayed side by side or stacked in a particular manner?

  7. Would you like an overall average line or specific markers on the histograms?

  8. Is there a preferred font style or size for the titles, labels, and legends?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. For the titles, you can use "Sales Distribution Across Regions" and "Profit Distribution
  Across Regions". Labels can simply be "Sales Amount" and "Profit Amount" on the
  x-axis, and "Frequency" on the y-axis.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Side by side, please.

  7. I do not know.
