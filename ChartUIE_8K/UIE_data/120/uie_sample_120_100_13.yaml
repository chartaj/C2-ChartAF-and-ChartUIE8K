initial_prompt: I'd like a donut chart that visualizes the distribution of sales across
  different regions from the Supermart Grocery Sales dataset. Please color-code the
  segments based on the regions, and include a legend for clarity. Additionally, show
  the percentage of total sales each region contributes within the donut segments.
  This will help us understand the sales performance geographically. Ensure the chart
  is clean and easy to interpret for a business presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for the regions?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels and legend?

  3. Should the percentages be displayed inside or outside the donut segments?

  4. Do you want any specific title for the chart?

  5. Would you like to include any additional information or annotations on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  7. Would you like to add any specific styling to the chart, such as borders or shadows?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I would prefer the percentages be displayed inside the donut segments.

  4. The title could be "Sales Distribution by Region".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
