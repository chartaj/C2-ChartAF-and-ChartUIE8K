09_answers: '<start user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure about the color palette, anything that clearly differentiates the
  categories is fine.

  2. Highlight the cities with the highest and lowest sales using different borders,
  like a thick border for the highest and a dashed border for the lowest.

  3. I am not sure, maybe just keep it simple with categories.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure, just make sure it fits well in a standard screen layout.
