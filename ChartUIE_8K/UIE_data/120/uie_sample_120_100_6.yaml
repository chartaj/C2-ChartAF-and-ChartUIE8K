initial_prompt: I want a geographic heatmap to visualize sales data from the Supermart
  Grocery Sales - Retail Analytics Dataset. The map should show the distribution of
  sales across different cities in Tamil Nadu, highlighting areas with higher sales
  in darker colors. Include details like Order Date to see if thereâ€™s any temporal
  trend. Also, use various sizes or shades to represent the profit and discount levels
  in different regions, making it easy to understand which areas are driving the most
  revenue and offering the highest discounts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different sales
  levels on the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the data for profit and discount levels to be represented,
  through varying circle sizes or color shades?

  3. Should the heatmap include any geographical markers such as city names or landmarks?

  4. What time granularity would you prefer for the Order Date attribute (e.g., daily,
  weekly, monthly)?

  5. Do you want any filtering options on the heatmap to look at specific time periods
  or ranges of sales, profit, and discount?

  6. Is there a specific base map style you prefer (e.g., satellite view, street view,
  plain map)?'

  2. I think varying circle sizes would be good.

  3. Yes, I would like city names included.
