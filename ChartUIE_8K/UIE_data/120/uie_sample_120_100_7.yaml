initial_prompt: I need a Treemap visualization for the 'Supermart Grocery Sales -
  Retail Analytics Dataset'. The Treemap should represent sales data breakdown by
  'Region', 'Category', 'Sub Category', and 'City'. Each segment should display the
  total 'Sales', and the size should reflect the proportion of sales contributed by
  each segment. Include color coding to distinguish between different 'Categories'
  within each region. Highlight the cities with the highest and lowest sales within
  each subcategory. Make sure to provide a legend for easy interpretation of colors
  and categories. Display this visual as interactive to explore different segments.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  between different ''Categories''?

  2. How would you like the cities with the highest and lowest sales within each subcategory
  to be highlighted (e.g., specific colors, borders, or annotations)?

  3. Should the legend display only categories, or would you like it to include additional
  information such as sales values or other details?

  4. Would you prefer specific font styles or sizes for the text displayed within
  each segment of the Treemap?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the ordering of ''Categories'' and ''Regions''
  within the Treemap visualization?

  6. Is there a specific layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the Treemap to ensure
  it fits well within your intended display space?'

  1. I am not sure about the color palette, anything that clearly differentiates the
  categories is fine.

  2. Highlight the cities with the highest and lowest sales using different borders,
  like a thick border for the highest and a dashed border for the lowest.

  3. I am not sure, maybe just keep it simple with categories.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure, just make sure it fits well in a standard screen layout.
