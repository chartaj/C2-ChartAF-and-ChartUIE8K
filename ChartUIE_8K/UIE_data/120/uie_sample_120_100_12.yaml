initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart for the Supermart Grocery Sales dataset. Use
  "Category" on the X-axis and "Sales" on the Y-axis. Bubbles should represent "Profit"
  with sizes based on "Discount". Different colors for "Region" would be great. This
  will help visualize how different categories are performing in terms of sales and
  profit across regions. Make sure the chart is easy to read and highlights key insights.
  No need for too many details; just want a quick visual representation. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating the regions?

  2. Would you like any specific ranges for the sizes of the bubbles based on "Discount"?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels?

  4. Should the chart include a legend for the colors and bubble sizes?

  5. Do you want the X-axis and Y-axis to have grid lines for better readability?

  6. Would you like the chart to include any annotation or emphasis on particularly
  high or low values?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title or axis labels?'
