initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the Supermart Grocery Sales data.
  Focus on the distribution of sales across different categories like 'Oil & Masala',
  'Beverages', and 'Food Grains'. Highlight the segments with unique colors to distinguish
  them. Include text annotations to show the sales amount for major categories. This
  will help in quickly understanding which category drives the most sales. Adding
  context or editorial comments via non-data-driven annotations could offer insights
  into why certain categories perform better. The goal is to provide clear, actionable
  insights on sales distribution to inform business decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  categories?

  2. Would you like to include a legend alongside the pie chart, or prefer labels
  directly on the segments?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text annotations?

  5. Where would you like the text annotations to be positioned on the chart (e.g.,
  inside the segments, outside with leader lines)?

  6. Do you have any preference on the chart title or subtitle formatting?

  7. Would you like to display the percentage of each category''s contribution along
  with the sales amount in the annotations?

  8. Are there any specific categories you want to emphasize or highlight more prominently?

  9. Would you like grid lines or segment separators in the pie chart for better clarity?

  10. Do you have any preference for the background color of the chart or chart area?'
