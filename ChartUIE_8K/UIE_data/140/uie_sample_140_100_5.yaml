initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the state minimum wage and the
  federal minimum wage adjusted for 2020 dollars across various states. Use the "State.Minimum.Wage.2020.Dollars"
  and "Federal.Minimum.Wage.2020.Dollars" columns. Display each state on the X-axis
  with two bars per state showing the respective minimum wages. Use data from 1968,
  focusing on a subset of states like Alabama, Alaska, and Arizona for clarity. The
  Y-axis should show the minimum wage in 2020 dollars. Title the chart "State vs.
  Federal Minimum Wages (2020 Dollars)".
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color of the bars representing state\
  \ and federal minimum wages?\n2. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better\
  \ readability? If so, would you prefer horizontal, vertical, or both?\n3. Do you\
  \ want to include data labels on the bars to show the exact values of the minimum\
  \ wages?\n4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart title and\
  \ axis labels? \n5. How would you like the bars grouped (e.g., with space between\
  \ different states, or clustered tightly together)?\n6. Would you prefer a specific\
  \ order for the states on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by state minimum wage\
  \ value, etc.)?\n7. Is there a particular legend placement you prefer (e.g., top,\
  \ bottom, left, right)?\n8. Do you want to include any annotations or text boxes\
  \ to highlight key points or differences?\n9. Should the Y-axis have a specific\
  \ scale or range of values?\n10. Would you like to include any additional contextual\
  \ information such as average minimum wage or median minimum wage as reference lines?"
