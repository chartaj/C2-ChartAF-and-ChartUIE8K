initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot visualizing the change in minimum wages over
  time for different states from 1968 to 2020. The x-axis should represent the years,
  and the y-axis should show the Effective Minimum Wage in 2020 dollars. Each point
  should represent a state's minimum wage for a specific year, with different colors
  representing different states. Make sure to include a legend to identify the states.
  This will help analyze how minimum wages have evolved across states over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the states
  on the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like any specific formatting for the x-axis or y-axis labels?

  3. Are there any specific fonts you prefer for the title, axes, or legend?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for easier reading
  of the data points?

  5. Do you have any preference for the shape or size of the scatter plot points?

  6. Should the chart include titles and labels for the axes? If yes, do you have
  specific wording in mind?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to be in a specific aspect ratio or size?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include on
  the plot?

  9. Would you like a trend line added to the scatter plot to better show the trend
  over time?

  10. How would you prefer the legend to be placed on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-right, outside the chart area)?'
