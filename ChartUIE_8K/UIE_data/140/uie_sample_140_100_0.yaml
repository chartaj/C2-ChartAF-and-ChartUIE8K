initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the US Minimum Wage by State
  from 1968 to 2020, with annotations highlighting key data points specifically for
  years with significant changes in minimum wages. Use different colors to indicate
  both State and Federal Minimum Wages in 2020 dollars, and add text annotations for
  the years and states with notable minimum wage changes. This will help in understanding
  the impact of inflation and policy changes over time, emphasizing the economic trends
  in various states. Highlight states with particularly high or low wages to draw
  attention to economic disparities.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between State
  and Federal Minimum Wages?

  2. How would you prefer the significant wage changes to be annotated? (e.g., with
  arrows, text labels, shapes)

  3. What specific years or time periods do you consider most significant for annotation?

  4. Are there specific states you would like to highlight for having particularly
  high or low wages?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for text annotations?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between State and Federal
  Minimum Wages, or do you prefer a different method for this distinction?

  7. Do you have a preferred orientation for the bar chart (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?

  8. Is there a specific way you would like the economic trends and disparities to
  be emphasized in the visualization?'
