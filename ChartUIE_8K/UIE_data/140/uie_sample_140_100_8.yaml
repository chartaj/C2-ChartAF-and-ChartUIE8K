initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the Effective Minimum Wage in
  2020 Dollars for each state from 1968 to 2020. The x-axis should represent the years,
  and the y-axis should represent the states. Use color gradients to indicate the
  intensity of wage values, with higher minimum wages showing in darker colors and
  lower ones in lighter colors. Include a legend to explain the color scale. Ensure
  that the data is clearly readable and each state/year combo is represented accurately.
  Title the chart "Effective Minimum Wage by State (1968-2020)". Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the chart title and labels?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap? If yes, any specific style?

  4. Would you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific position? For example,
  top, bottom, left, or right?

  5. Are there any specific states or time ranges you would like to highlight within
  the heatmap?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include labels for the exact wage values within each cell,
  or prefer to keep it clean with just the color gradient?

  8. Is there a preferred format for the axis labels (e.g., full year, abbreviated
  state names)?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on the chart? If so, where
  and what should they say?

  10. Are there any accessibility considerations or color-blind friendly schemes you
  would like to implement?'
