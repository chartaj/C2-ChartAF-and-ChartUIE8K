initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020.
  Each bar should represent a year, showing the average closing price. Add text annotations
  to highlight the highest and lowest average closing prices. Use different colors
  to emphasize these bars. The purpose is to analyze yearly performance trends and
  identify significant peaks and troughs. Provide context on Tesla's growth over the
  decade in the annotations. The chart is for overviewing performance, focusing on
  annual changes rather than daily volatility, and will help investors understand
  long-term trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used in the chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for the highest and lowest average closing
  prices to be styled (e.g., font size, color, bold)?

  3. Are there any specific fonts you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  4. Do you want gridlines included in the chart? If so, should they be in the background
  or foreground?

  5. Would you like a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, what should they be?

  6. Do you want the axis labels to be styled in a particular way (e.g., font size,
  color)?

  7. Should each bar have its own data label showing the average closing price?

  8. Do you prefer any specific chart dimensions (e.g., width and height)?'
