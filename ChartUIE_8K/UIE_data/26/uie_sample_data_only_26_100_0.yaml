02_initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020.
  Each bar should represent a year, showing the average closing price. Add text annotations
  to highlight the highest and lowest average closing prices. Use different colors
  to emphasize these bars. The purpose is to analyze yearly performance trends and
  identify significant peaks and troughs. Provide context on Tesla's growth over the
  decade in the annotations. The chart is for overviewing performance, focusing on
  annual changes rather than daily volatility, and will help investors understand
  long-term trends.
