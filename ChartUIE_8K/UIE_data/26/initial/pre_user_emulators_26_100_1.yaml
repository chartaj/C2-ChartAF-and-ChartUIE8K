2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a candlestick chart for Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020. Highlight
  the opening and closing prices with prominent colors to show their changes over
  time. Add text annotations for significant dates like stock splits or major events
  to provide context. Emphasize the highest and lowest prices by modifying their appearance,
  such as changing their size or color. Display the volume traded with bars below
  the candlestick chart to show trading activity intensity. The primary purpose is
  to visualize Tesla's stock performance and trading patterns over the decade for
  a summary analysis.
