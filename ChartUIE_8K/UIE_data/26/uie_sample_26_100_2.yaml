initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020, focusing
  on the daily closing prices. Use text annotations to highlight specific dates with
  significant price changes. The heatmap should visually emphasize high and low close
  prices using a gradient, and highlights can modify colors to show the intensity
  of volumes traded. The purpose is to identify trends and patterns over time, understanding
  how stock prices fluctuated, which can be crucial for market analysis. Utilize annotations
  to provide context, such as marking major events or turning points, to enhance the
  overall interpretability of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the gradient in the heatmap
  to represent high and low close prices?

  2. Are there particular dates or events you would like to emphasize with annotations
  on the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or formatting for text annotations (e.g., font
  size, color)?

  4. Would you like to see a legend explaining the gradient colors and volume intensity
  on the heatmap?

  5. Do you have preferences on the layout of the heatmap (e.g., overall dimensions,
  aspect ratio)?

  6. Are there any additional markings or labels you would like to include to enhance
  the interpretability of the data?'
