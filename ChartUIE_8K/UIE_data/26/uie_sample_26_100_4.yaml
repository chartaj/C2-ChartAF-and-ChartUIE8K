initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Tesla stock data from 2010 to 2020. Please
  create a line chart that shows the trend over this period. The x-axis should represent
  the dates from the dataset, while the y-axis should represent the stock prices.
  Include separate lines for the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices to show
  the different aspects of the daily stock performance. Ensure the chart is clear
  and distinguishable with appropriate legends and titles. Make sure to handle any
  missing data appropriately. This should help in understanding the stock trends over
  the decade. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each line (Open, High,
  Low, Close)?

  2. Would you prefer any specific style for the lines (solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. Do you want grid lines enabled in the background for better readability?

  4. Should the chart include markers at each data point?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the chart titles and
  legends?

  6. Would you like a specific format for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g., month-year,
  year only)?

  7. Do you want to include a trendline or moving average in the chart?

  8. Should there be tooltips or labels indicating the exact values at each data point?

  9. Do you want any annotations for significant events or dates within the 2010-2020
  timeframe?

  10. Should the y-axis be adjusted to fit the data range tightly or keep a fixed
  scale for all data points?'
