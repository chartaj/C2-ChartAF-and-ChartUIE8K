initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the best-selling video games of
  all time. Use 'Sales' as the y-axis and 'Rank' as the x-axis. Highlight the top
  3 games by changing their point size and color. Add text annotations for the components
  like title, initial release date, and developer to the top 3 games to draw attention.
