initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing the best-selling video games
  of all time. The x-axis should represent game titles, and the y-axis will show sales
  figures in millions. Each bar should be stacked by platform, differentiating sales
  per platform for each game. Use different colors to represent each platform. Make
  sure the legend identifies each platform distinctly. The chart should clearly show
  which game has the highest sales and how those sales are distributed across different
  platforms. Include all relevant columns like Rank, Title, Sales, and Platform(s).
  Ensure it is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the platforms in the
  stacked bar chart?

  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, or do you prefer a
  cleaner look without them?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the game titles on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by sales rank)?

  4. Would you like data labels to be displayed on the bars to show exact sales figures?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the game titles and other text
  elements in the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  wording or formatting preferences for them?

  7. Do you want additional annotations or callouts to highlight key points, such
  as the highest-selling game or specific platform contributions?'
