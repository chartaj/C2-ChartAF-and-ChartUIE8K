initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the sales data of the best-selling
  video games of all time. The x-axis should represent the rank, and the y-axis should
  indicate the sales figures. Annotate specific data points for titles like "Minecraft,"
  "Grand Theft Auto V," and "Tetris (EA)" to highlight their remarkable sales. Use
  different colors or sizes to emphasize these top-selling games, making them stand
  out visually. This will help viewers quickly identify the leading titles and their
  sales performance. Include data labels for major data points to provide additional
  context and clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the annotations for titles like "Minecraft," "Grand Theft
  Auto V," and "Tetris (EA)" to be displayed? (e.g., text boxes, arrows)

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the data labels and
  annotations?

  4. Would you like the background of the chart to be plain or have a specific pattern/gradient?

  5. Should the lines representing sales figures be solid or would you prefer a different
  line style (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  6. Do you want any gridlines in the background to help with reading the sales figures?
  If so, what style do you prefer for the gridlines?

  7. Are there any specific titles other than "Minecraft," "Grand Theft Auto V," and
  "Tetris (EA)" that you want to emphasize or annotate?

  8. Would you prefer the different sizes or different shapes to emphasize the top-selling
  games alongside the different colors?

  9. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the legend and title on the
  chart?

  10. Should the chart be designed with a specific size or aspect ratio in mind? If
  yes, please specify.'
