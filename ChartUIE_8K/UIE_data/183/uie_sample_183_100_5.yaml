initial_prompt: Please create a box plot using the given data on the best-selling
  video games of all time. The plot should visualize the distribution of game sales
  (in units) across different platforms. Each box in the plot should represent a different
  platform, and the y-axis should show the sales figures. Ensure that outliers and
  other statistics like median, quartiles, and range are clearly depicted. Additionally,
  include labels for both axes, a title for the chart, and a legend if necessary.
  The x-axis should represent the various gaming platforms.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box plot?

  2. Would you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, modern)?

  3. Do you want the outliers to be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., with different
  colors or shapes)?

  4. Should the median line within the box be accentuated more prominently than the
  default setting?

  5. Are there any specific formats or fonts you prefer for axis labels and the chart
  title?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be shown on the plot? If so, do you prefer a specific
  style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top-left,
  bottom-right)?

  8. Do you require any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  9. How would you like the units on the y-axis to be formatted (e.g., plain numbers,
  with commas, in millions)?'
