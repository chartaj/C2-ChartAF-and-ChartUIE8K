initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to show correlations between different insurance
  variables, highlighting higher correlations. Use the columns like MAANTHUI, MINKM30,
  MINK4575. Annotate with shapes to indicate strong correlations visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like to define ''strong'' correlations (specific threshold)?

  3. Do you prefer certain shapes for annotating strong correlations?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient and shapes?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or size for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a threshold of 0.7 or higher?

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend explaining the color gradient and shapes.

  5. I have no specific preference.'
