initial_prompt: 'I want to create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution
  of car ownership types across different income groups. Specifically, I want to see
  the counts of ''MAUT0'', ''MAUT1'', and ''MAUT2'' (number of cars: none, one, two
  or more) stacked for each income group defined by ''MINKM30'', ''MINK3045'', ''MINK4575'',
  ''MINK7512'', ''MINK123M''. This will help us understand how car ownership varies
  with income. The x-axis should have the income groups and the y-axis should show
  the count of car ownership types. Use colors to differentiate between ''MAUT0'',
  ''MAUT1'', and ''MAUT2''.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to distinguish
  between ''MAUT0'', ''MAUT1'', and ''MAUT2''?

  2. Would you like to add data labels showing the exact count of each car ownership
  type on the bars?

  3. Should there be a legend to explain the color coding for ''MAUT0'', ''MAUT1'',
  and ''MAUT2''?

  4. Do you prefer any particular ordering for the income groups on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ascending or descending order)?

  5. Would you like gridlines for better readability, and if so, do you have a preference
  for their style?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like to assign to the stacked bar chart?

  7. Are there any labels you''d like to include for the x-axis and y-axis apart from
  the income groups and count of car ownership types respectively?

  8. Should the chart display tooltips on hover to show additional details for each
  section of the stacked bar?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the fonts or font sizes used in the
  chart?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to have a specific width and height, or should it
  be responsive to the display size?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, there should be a legend to explain the color coding.

  4. I do not know.

  on the y-axis.

  8. I do not need tooltips.

  9. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  10. I have no specific preference for the chart''s width and height.'
