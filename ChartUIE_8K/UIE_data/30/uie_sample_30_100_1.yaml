initial_prompt: Please create a treemap to visualize the Caravan Insurance Challenge
  data, focusing on the different types of automobile-related columns (e.g., MAUT1,
  MAUT2, PPERSAUT). Each section of the treemap should represent a different automobile
  category, with the size of the sections proportional to the frequency of each category.
  Highlight the most frequently occurring categories to emphasize their significance.
  The goal is to understand the distribution and prominence of various automobile
  types among the dataset. Ensure to annotate with shapes and highlights to make critical
  sections stand out effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for the different categories in
  the treemap?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the annotations?

  3. Are there particular shapes you would like to use for highlighting critical sections?

  4. Do you have a preference for the overall style or theme of the treemap (e.g.,
  minimalist, vibrant)?

  5. Should there be a specific ordering for the categories in the treemap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. How detailed do you want the annotations to be (e.g., include exact counts, percentages)?

  8. Are there any specific automobile categories you want to be emphasized more than
  others besides the most frequent ones?'
