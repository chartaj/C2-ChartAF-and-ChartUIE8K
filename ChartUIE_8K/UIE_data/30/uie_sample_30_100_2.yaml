initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the correlation between the different attributes
  related to people who bought caravan insurance. Emphasize columns like MOSTYPE (customer
  type), MGEMLEEF (average age), MHHUUR (rented house), MHKOOP (owned house), and
  CARAVAN (insurance purchased). Use highlights to identify strong correlations, and
  shapes to designate significant trends. This visualization aims to uncover patterns
  in the types of customers more likely to purchase caravan insurance, essential for
  targeted marketing strategies. Please make sure all data columns are reflected in
  the chart for comprehensive analysis.

  3. How would you like the strength of correlations to be highlighted (e.g., using
  gradients, color intensity)?

  4. Should the heatmap include labels for exact correlation values, or just visual
  indications (e.g., colors)?

  5. Do you have a preferred range of values for highlighting strong correlations?

  6. Is there a specific way you''d like to handle negative correlations in the heatmap?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or legends added to make the chart more
  understandable?

  8. Are there any other visual elements you''d like to see on the chart to aid in
  identifying patterns or trends?'
