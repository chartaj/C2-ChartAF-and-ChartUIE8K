initial_prompt: I need a line chart to track the average number of automobiles owned
  (columns MAUT1, MAUT2, MAUT0) against different income ranges (MINKM30, MINK3045,
  MINK4575, MINK7512, MINK123M). Highlight the key trends, such as any significant
  increases or decreases. Please include markers at each data point to emphasize specific
  values. This will help visualize ownership preferences relative to income levels
  for the Caravan Insurance Challenge dataset. Ensure the chart clearly distinguishes
  between multiple income brackets and ownership types. Utilize color and size adjustments
  to highlight differences effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different income
  brackets and ownership types?

  2. Are there any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) you would prefer
  for distinguishing between different ownership types?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the shape of the markers at each data point (e.g.,
  circles, squares, triangles)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend on the chart? If so, where would you prefer
  it to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the chart
  text?

  7. Would you like the chart to include grid lines? If so, should they be displayed
  on both the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the size and layout of the overall chart (e.g.,
  width, height, aspect ratio)?

  9. Would you like to display the exact values of the data points on the chart or
  just the trend lines with markers?'
