initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'MOSTYPE'
  column, which represents customer types, from the provided caravan insurance dataset.
  Ensure the x-axis represents the distinct customer types and the y-axis indicates
  the number of instances for each type. This will help us understand the frequency
  of different customer types in our dataset. Also, consider adding a histogram for
  the 'MINKGEM' column to show the distribution of average income. This will help
  us compare the frequencies of the customer types alongside their average income
  levels. Ensure both histograms are clear and labeled appropriately.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the histograms?

  2. Would you like each histogram in a separate chart or combined into one?

  3. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the x-axis and y-axis of
  both histograms?

  4. Do you prefer grid lines in the background of the histograms?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the bin width or number of bins in the histograms?

  6. Should we include a legend for identifying each histogram if they are combined
  into one chart?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the labels and
  titles?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the histograms?

  9. Do you want any specific data transformation (e.g., normalization) before creating
  the histograms?

  10. Are there any minimum or maximum value limits you want to set for the x-axis
  or y-axis?'
