initial_prompt: Create a histogram depicting the distribution of participants' ages
  from the Memory Test on Drugged Islanders dataset. Highlight individuals in the
  'Happy' and 'Sad' groups using distinct colors to differentiate them. Ensure that
  text annotations display the average memory score difference (Diff) above the relevant
  age bins. The purpose is to analyze any correlation between age and memory performance
  changes, influenced by emotional states and drug dosage, in a psychological study
  context. Providing clear visual distinctions and data-driven insights will help
  in understanding the experimental results and their practical implications on memory
  and drug research.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between the
  ''Happy'' and ''Sad'' groups?

  2. Would you like the histogram to have a specific number of age bins or should
  it be automatically determined based on the data?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement and style of the text
  annotations displaying the average memory score difference?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include any specific titles or descriptions?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels, annotations,
  and titles on the chart?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the histogram for better readability,
  and if so, do you have preferences for their style and color?

  7. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like to include to clearly denote
  the ''Happy'' and ''Sad'' groups?

  8. Do you require any specific margins or padding around the chart elements for
  better presentation and clarity?

  9. Would you like to include a chart title that reflects the purpose of the analysis,
  and if so, do you have a specific title in mind?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have specific preferences for the placement and style of the text annotations.

  4. I would like the x-axis to be labeled "Age" and the y-axis to be labeled "Number
  of Participants".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Please include a legend to denote the ''Happy'' and ''Sad'' groups.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, please include a chart title. "Age Distribution and Memory Performance Differences
  in ''Happy'' and ''Sad'' Groups"'
