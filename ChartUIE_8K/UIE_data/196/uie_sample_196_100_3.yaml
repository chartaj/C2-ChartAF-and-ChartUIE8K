initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart visualizing the differences in
  memory scores before and after drug administration for each individual. The x-axis
  should represent individuals by their first and last names, and the y-axis should
  show memory scores. Use different colors to represent memory scores before and after.
  Additionally, use a third color to indicate the difference in scores (Diff). Include
  labels for Happy/Sad groups, Dosage, and Drug types for clarity. This will help
  in understanding how each drug impacts memory across different groups under various
  dosages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the memory scores before and
  after drug administration?

  2. What color would you like to use to indicate the difference in scores (Diff)?

  3. How would you like the Happy/Sad groups, Dosage, and Drug types to be labeled
  on the chart (e.g., legend position, font size)?

  4. Do you want any specific formatting for the x-axis labels (first and last names)
  such as font type or angle?

  5. Do you prefer gridlines on the y-axis to help with interpreting memory scores?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the individuals to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by group)?

  7. Are there any particular chart titles or subtitle preferences you have?

  8. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know, but please make them clear and easily readable.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, gridlines on the y-axis would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific titles or subtitle preferences.
