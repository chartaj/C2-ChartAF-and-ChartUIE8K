initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the Memory Test on Drugged
  Islanders data. The x-axis should represent the 'Happy_Sad_group' and the y-axis
  should show the average 'Diff' in memory scores (Mem_Score_After - Mem_Score_Before)
  for each group. We want to see how the memory score difference varies between happy
  and sad groups. Please use different colors to distinguish between the 'Happy' and
  'Sad' groups in the chart. This will help us understand the effect of the drug on
  memory based on the emotional state of the participants. Thank you!
