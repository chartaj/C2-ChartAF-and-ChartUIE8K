initial_prompt: I need a geographic heatmap visualizing the number of terrorist attacks
  worldwide over multiple years. The data file `72.csv` contains columns for Entity
  (country), Code (country code), Year, and Terrorist attacks. There are some missing
  values in the Code column. I want the heatmap to show the intensity of attacks across
  different regions, with a color gradient indicating the number of attacks. The map
  should allow me to see changes over the years, so an interactive element would be
  helpful. Please make sure the map is clear and visually appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for indicating the intensity
  of terrorist attacks?

  2. What map projection would you prefer for the geographic heatmap (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson, etc.)?

  3. Do you want specific labels for countries, regions, or continents to be displayed
  on the map?

  4. Should the map include tooltips or labels that show the exact number of terrorist
  attacks when hovering over a region?

  5. Would you like the years to be represented on a timeline slider, buttons, or
  another specific navigation mechanism?

  6. Do you prefer the map to start at a specific year, or should it default to showing
  the most recent year''s data?

  7. Are there any specific regions or countries you would like to highlight or focus
  on in the heatmap?

  8. Should the map include a legend that explains the color gradient and the corresponding
  number of attacks?

  9. Would you prefer certain basemap styles (e.g., streets, satellite, outdoor, light,
  dark)?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size for the labels
  and titles on the map?'
