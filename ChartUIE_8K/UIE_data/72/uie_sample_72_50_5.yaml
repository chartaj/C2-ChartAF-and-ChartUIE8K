  per country over the years. Highlight countries with the highest and lowest incidents.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to distinguish
  between high and low incidents?

  2. Should specific countries be labeled or annotated on the map for clarity?

  aggregate data over a range of years?

  4. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for the map (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson, etc.)?

  5. How would you like the data to be normalized, if at all (e.g., per capita, absolute
  numbers)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the legend position on the map?

  7. Would you like to include additional contextual information on the map, such
  as country names or borders?

  8. Is there a preferred method for highlighting the countries with the highest and
  lowest incidents (e.g., different colors, borders, tooltips)?
