  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to distinguish
  between high and low incidents?

  2. Should specific countries be labeled or annotated on the map for clarity?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to display data for each individual year, or should it
  aggregate data over a range of years?

  4. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for the map (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson, etc.)?

  5. How would you like the data to be normalized, if at all (e.g., per capita, absolute
  numbers)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the legend position on the map?

  7. Would you like to include additional contextual information on the map, such
  as country names or borders?

  8. Is there a preferred method for highlighting the countries with the highest and
  lowest incidents (e.g., different colors, borders, tooltips)?

  9. Are there any specific regions or countries you would like to focus on or zoom
