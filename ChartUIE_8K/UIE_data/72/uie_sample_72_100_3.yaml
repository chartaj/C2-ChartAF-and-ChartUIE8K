initial_prompt: Please create a treemap to visualize the number of terrorist attacks
  globally over the years. The dataset contains information about the number of terrorist
  attacks per country from 1970 to 2020. I want the treemap to show the distribution
  of attacks by country, with each country represented by a rectangle. The size of
  each rectangle should correspond to the total number of terrorist attacks in that
  country. Use different colors to represent different regions or continents for better
  clarity. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to understand, highlighting the areas
  with the highest concentration of attacks.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to represent
  different regions or continents?

  2. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included in the treemap?

  3. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or overall sizing of the treemap?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding for different regions
  or continents?

  5. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to be particularly
  highlighted or emphasized?

  6. Would you like the chart to display additional information on hover or click,
  such as the exact number of attacks for each country?

  7. Should the chart title and axis labels follow any specific naming conventions
  or styles?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for clarity and readability?'
