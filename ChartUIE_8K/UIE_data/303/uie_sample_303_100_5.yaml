initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the presence (Present) and
  absence (Absent) of different benthic habitat types (CORAL REEF, PAVEMENT, RHODOLITH,
  SAND, etc.) across the first few site samples. Each group should represent a site
  (e.g., AA2017_001, AA2017_002, AA2017_003), and within each group, show bars for
  each habitat type indicating their presence or absence. Use different colors for
  Present and Absent to clearly differentiate between the two states. Title the chart
  "Benthic Habitat Types Presence by Site".
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for distinguishing between
  ''Present'' and ''Absent'' states?

  2. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart title,
  axis labels, and legends?

  3. Would you like gridlines in the background of the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout of the legend (e.g., position relative
  to the chart)?

  5. What is the preferred orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should there be any specific order for the sites or the habitat types on the
  axes?

  7. Are there any annotations or labels you''d like to be included on the bars (e.g.,
  percentage or count)?

  8. Do you need specific margins or padding around the chart?

  9. Would you like to include error bars or any form of uncertainty representation?

  10. Is there a preference for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, colorful)?'
