initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between latitude
  and longitude of assessment sites. Please color-code the points based on the 'SITE
  TYPE' and use point size to indicate 'DEPTH' values. Include labels for 'PROJECT'
  and 'DATE COLLECTED'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the ''SITE TYPE'' categories?

  2. What specific markers or shapes should we use for the scatter plot points?

  3. Should there be any particular range or scale for the ''DEPTH'' values when determining
  the point sizes?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the scatter plot for easier reference of latitude and
  longitude values?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the ''PROJECT'' and ''DATE
  COLLECTED'' labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend for the color-coding and point sizes?

  7. Should the axes be labeled in a specific way other than the default?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to include a title and/or subtitle?

  9. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the chart (e.g., landscape
  or portrait)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  on the chart?'
