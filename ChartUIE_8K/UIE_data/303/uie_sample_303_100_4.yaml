initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to visualize correlations in the underwater
  video assessment data from St. Thomas and St. John. Specifically, I want to see
  how Depth correlates with the presence of different benthic habitat types like Coral
  Reef, Pavement, and Rhodolith across different Sites. Each bubble should represent
  a Site, with the bubble size indicating Depth. The chart should help identify patterns,
  like if certain depths are prone to specific habitat types. Use colors to differentiate
  the habitat types for clear visualization. The X-axis can represent Sites and the
  Y-axis Depth, categorized by geographic region.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color palette to differentiate
  habitat types?

  2. Are there any specific labeling preferences you have for Sites on the X-axis?

  3. Do you want to include a legend that explicitly shows what each color represents
  for habitat types?

  4. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the text elements in the
  chart?

  5. Is there any specific range of Depth you want to highlight on the Y-axis?

  6. Do you have any requirements for the aspect ratio or size of the bubble chart?

  7. Should the bubbles have any transparency to make overlapping clear?

  8. Are there any specific gridlines or ticks preferences for the axes?

  9. Do you want to incorporate hover text or tooltips for additional data details
  when interacting with the bubbles?'
