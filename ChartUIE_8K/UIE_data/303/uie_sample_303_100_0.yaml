initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the prevalence of different substrate
  types in the benthic habitats surveyed around Puerto Rico. The x-axis should represent
  various substrate types such as Coral Reef, Pavement, Rhodolith, Sand, Hard Coral,
  Soft Coral, Macroalgae, Sponge, Seagrass, Artificial, and Unknown. The y-axis should
  indicate their frequency. Highlight the most common and least common substrate types
  for better visual emphasis. Add text annotations for the highest and lowest values
  to highlight significant findings. Ensure the chart provides clear insights into
  substrate distribution for environmental analysis purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Do you want any specific font styles or sizes for the text annotations?

  3. Should the bars representing the most and least common substrate types be a different
  color or pattern for emphasis?

  4. Are there any specific axis labels or chart titles you would like to include?

  5. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the bar chart (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical bars)?

  6. Would you like to add grid lines to the chart for better readability?

  7. Should there be any legends or keys explaining the bar colors or patterns?

  8. Is there a specific format for the numerical values on the y-axis (e.g., rounded,
  percentage)?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for margins or spacing between bars?

  10. Are there any additional notes or descriptions you want to include on the chart?'
