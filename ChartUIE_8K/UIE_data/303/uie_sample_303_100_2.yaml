initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the depth distribution in the underwater
  video assessment of benthic habitats. Use text annotations to highlight the deepest
  and shallowest points recorded. Incorporate highlights to differentiate between
  presence and absence of coral reef across different depths. This will help in quickly
  identifying key observations related to depth and coral reef presence. Add non-data-driven
  annotations to provide context on the significance of the observed depth range.
  The purpose is to better understand the environmental conditions and habitat distribution,
  which is critical for environmental science studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between the
  presence and absence of coral reef?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations for the deepest and shallowest points
  to be displayed (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Do you want any specific titles or labels for the axes of the histogram?

  4. Should the histogram bins be of a specific width or number?

  5. Is there a specific font or style you prefer for non-data-driven annotations?

  6. How would you like the contextual information on the significance of the depth
  range to be displayed (e.g., as a separate text box, below the chart)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or design aspects of the histogram?

  8. Is there any additional information or specific observations you want to include
  in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color scheme for differentiating between
  the presence and absence of coral reef.

  2. I would prefer the text annotations for the deepest and shallowest points to
  be in a larger font size and a contrasting color, but I am not sure which color.

  3. Yes, I would like specific titles or labels for the axes. The x-axis should be
  labeled "Depth (meters)" and the y-axis "Frequency".

  4. I do not know if the histogram bins should be of a specific width or number.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the font or style for non-data-driven
  annotations.

  6. I am not sure how the contextual information on the significance of the depth
  range should be displayed, maybe as a separate text box?

  7. I have no specific preference for the overall layout or design aspects of the
  histogram.

  8. I have no additional information or specific observations to include in the chart.'
