initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the underwater video assessment
  of benthic habitats data. Use the 'LATITUDE' and 'LONGITUDE' columns for the x and
  y axes, respectively. Color-code the points by 'SITE TYPE'. Include markers for
  'DEPTH' to indicate the depth of each point. Each marker should also differentiate
  between 'PAVEMENT' presence and absence. Add a hover tooltip to show detailed information
  including 'DATE COLLECTED', 'TIME COLLECTED', 'SITE ID', and 'URL LINK'. Make sure
  the plot is easy to read and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to be used for the ''SITE
  TYPE'' categories?

  2. How would you like the markers indicating ''DEPTH'' to be represented (e.g.,
  size, color gradient)?

  3. What type of symbol would you prefer for differentiating ''PAVEMENT'' presence
  and absence (e.g., circle for presence, square for absence)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the tooltip format or layout containing
  ''DATE COLLECTED'', ''TIME COLLECTED'', ''SITE ID'', and ''URL LINK''?

  5. Is there a particular font or font size that you would like for axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the plot? If so, do you have a preference
  for their style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall styling/theme of the plot (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed)?'
