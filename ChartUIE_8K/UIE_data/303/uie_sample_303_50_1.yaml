initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap displaying benthic habitat data from Puerto
  Rico. Include text annotations for key points like depth and presence of coral.
  Highlight areas with high macroalgae and sponge concentrations. The map should help
  in visualizing habitat distribution and environmental assessments.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for differentiating various concentrations
  of macroalgae and sponges?

  2. Do you have a preferred basemap (e.g., satellite, terrain, or simple outline
  map) for the geographic heatmap?

  3. Are there specific symbols or markers you would like to use for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like the depth to be represented? (e.g., through color gradients,
  contour lines)

  5. Do you have preferred font styles or sizes for the text annotations on key points?

  6. Are there specific geographic areas or boundaries within Puerto Rico that should
  be emphasized or highlighted?

  7. Would you like a legend or key to explain the various habitat types and concentrations
  on the heatmap?

  8. Do you have specific requirements for the map''s scale or zoom levels?

  9. Are there any particular data points or regions that you want to ensure are prominently
  displayed or highlighted?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Satellite basemap would be preferred.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Color gradients for depth would be good.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a legend or key would be useful.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.'
