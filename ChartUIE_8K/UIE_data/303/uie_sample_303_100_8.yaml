initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap to display the presence and absence of various
  underwater features, such as coral reefs, pavement, rhodolith, etc., across different
  sites sampled. Utilize columns like 'SITE ID' and 'DATE COLLECTED' for the sites
  and 'CORAL REEF', 'PAVEMENT', 'RHODOLITH', etc., for habitat features. Each cell
  should indicate 'Present' or 'Absent' by color intensity. Add layers for each feature,
  ensuring clarity and ease of comparison across sites. Consider using color gradients
  to depict the presence/absence effectively. Tie this to environmental-science data
  to assess benthic habitat health.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for indicating ''Present''
  or ''Absent'' in the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer a specific color gradient for the heatmap to enhance clarity
  and comparison?

  3. Should the heatmap have any specific annotations or labels for easier interpretation?

  4. Do you want the sites to be grouped or ordered in a particular manner, such as
  by ''DATE COLLECTED'' or another criterion?

  5. Are there any specific legends or keys you would like to include for better understanding
  of the heatmap?

  6. Is there a preference for the size or scale of the heatmap cells for readability?

  7. Would you like to include any additional data or references in the heatmap for
  context?'
answers: '<start user emulated response>

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure, something that enhances clarity and comparison would be good.

  3. Yes, please include annotations or labels for easier interpretation.

  4. Please order the sites by ''DATE COLLECTED''.

  5. I do not know, whatever you think is best for understanding the heatmap.

  6. I am not sure, but it should be readable.

  7. No, the data provided should be sufficient.
