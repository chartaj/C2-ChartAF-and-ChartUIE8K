initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing information about different continents,
  including average temperature, population, area, and GDP. I want to create a choropleth
  map that visualizes these metrics across continents. The map should use color gradients
  to represent the average temperature and display additional interactive features
  like tooltips or pop-ups that show the population, area, and GDP when hovering over
  each continent. Please ensure the map is visually intuitive and allows for easy
  comparison between the continents. The end goal is to have a clear, informative,
  and engaging visual representation of this geographic data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the gradient representing
  the average temperature?

  2. Do you prefer a specific map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  3. Are there specific labels or legends you would like to include on the map?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style or size used in the map?

  5. Are there any specific data annotations you would like to see on the map?

  6. Would you like to include any geographical boundaries or markers on the map?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the range of the color gradient (e.g., specific
  temperature ranges)?

  8. Is there a maximum or minimum number of color breaks you prefer for the gradient
  scale?

  9. Are there particular visual elements you want to emphasize for the general public,
  researchers, or policymakers?

  10. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the map? If so, do you have
  a specific title in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color gradient for average temperature.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. No, I am not sure.

  6. Yes, include geographical boundaries between the continents.

  7. I do not have a preference for specific temperature ranges.

  8. I am not sure, maybe 5-7 color breaks would be good.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, please include a title. The title can be "Global Continent Metrics Visualization"
  and the subtitle "Average Temperature with Population, Area, and GDP".'
