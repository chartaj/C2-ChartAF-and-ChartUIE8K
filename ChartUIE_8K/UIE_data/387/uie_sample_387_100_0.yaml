  Create a treemap chart visualizing the average temperature, population, area, and
  GDP of different continents. Highlight continents with the highest and lowest GDP.
  Use text annotations to display the average temperature for each continent. The
  purpose is to provide a quick overview and comparison of socio-economic and environmental
  attributes across different continents. Ensure that the chart is clear, with distinct
  colors representing each continent. Include a key for easy understanding of the
  colors and metrics used in the visualization. This chart will be useful for educational
  purposes in social science studies.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different continents
  in the treemap?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for average temperature to be formatted
  (e.g., font size, font type)?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the layout or aspect ratio of the treemap?

  4. Should the key include any specific descriptions or legends for better understanding?

  5. Would you prefer the continents with the highest and lowest GDP to be highlighted
  in a particular color or style?

  6. Are there any specific guidelines or standards that need to be followed for educational
  purposes in social science studies?

  7. Do you want to include any additional metadata or information alongside the key
  for the treemap?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I have no specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure about the format for text annotations, maybe just make sure it
  is readable.

  3. I do not know about the layout or aspect ratio.

  4. I am not sure, maybe just a basic legend with descriptions.

  5. No specific preference for the highlight style, just make it clear.

  6. I do not know of any specific guidelines or standards.

  7. I have no specific preference for additional metadata.
