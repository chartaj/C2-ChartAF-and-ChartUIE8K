initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of average temperature,
  population, area, and GDP across continents. Use the dataset that includes average
  temperature, population, area, and GDP values categorized by continents. Highlight
  discrepancies and anomalies in these distributions. Add text annotations for key
  data points, such as the continent with the highest GDP or largest population, to
  draw attention. The visualization should effectively convey differences and trends
  across continents, aiding in social-science analysis by providing a clear, comparative
  visual summary of the data. Use distinct colors for each continent for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for each continent?

  2. Are there any specific colors you would like to avoid?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the ordering of continents on the plot?

  5. Should specific ranges or thresholds be highlighted on the plot?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed in the background?

  7. Do you prefer the plot to have a specific title or subtitle?

  8. How detailed should the x and y-axis labels be (e.g., numerical precision)?

  9. Are there any other specific key data points you want annotated besides the highest
  GDP and largest population?

  10. Should outliers be distinctly marked in any specific way?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure, maybe medium-sized and bold.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include a title that summarizes the visualization.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I am not sure.'
