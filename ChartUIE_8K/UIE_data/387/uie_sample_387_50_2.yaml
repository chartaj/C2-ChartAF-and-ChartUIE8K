initial_prompt: Create a violin plot showing the distribution of Average Temperature
  for continents. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight the mean temperature
  for each continent. Use highlights to distinguish continents.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to distinguish
  different continents?

  2. Should the mean temperature annotations be displayed inside or outside the violins?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the axes have specific labels or titles?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be visible on the plot?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to the plot to identify the continents?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the continents on the plot?

  8. Do you want to include any additional statistical measures (e.g., median, quartiles)
  along with the mean temperature in the annotations?

  9. Should the violins be scaled equally (same width) or based on the number of data
  points per continent?'
