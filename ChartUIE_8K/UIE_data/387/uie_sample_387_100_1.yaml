initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the average temperature, population,
  area, and GDP of continents. Use text annotations to display values for specific
  data points in the chart. Highlight the continents with the highest and lowest values
  in each category to draw attention to extremes. The chart should help the viewer
  compare these attributes across different continents and gain insights into patterns
  and disparities among them. This visualization will be useful for social science
  studies to understand regional differences. Make sure to label the axes and provide
  a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the bar chart?

  2. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical bars in the bar chart?

  3. Should the bars representing the continents with the highest and lowest values
  in each category have different colors or patterns?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you want the names of the continents to be displayed on the bars or as labels
  on the axes?

  6. How large should the text annotations be in relation to the rest of the chart?

  7. Should the text annotations include any additional information besides the data
  values?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text labels and annotations?

  9. Is there a preferred order in which the continents should be displayed on the
  chart (e.g., alphabetical order, from highest to lowest value in a specific category)?

  10. Do you want to display all attributes in a single chart or separated into multiple
  charts for each attribute?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, different colors would help highlight the highest and lowest values.

  4. Yes, including gridlines would be good for readability.
