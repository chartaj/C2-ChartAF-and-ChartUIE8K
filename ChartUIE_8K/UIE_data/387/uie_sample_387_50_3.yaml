initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap showing average temperature, population, area,
  and GDP by continent. Highlight relationships and variations across continents.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for visualizing
  different continents?

  2. Would you like a color gradient to represent different value ranges within the
  heatmap? If so, do you have any specific preferences?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for each cell displaying numeric values?

  4. Do you prefer a particular ordering of the continents on the heatmap (e.g., alphabetically,
  by a specific attribute)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers to highlight significant
  relationships or variations?

  6. Is there a preference for the overall layout of the heatmap (e.g., square cells,
  aspect ratio)?

  7. Do you want to include any additional context or metadata, such as legends, titles,
  or axis labels, for better understanding?'
