initial_prompt: Using the given dataset on the average temperature, population, area,
  and GDP of various continents, create a line chart. The x-axis should represent
  the different continents, and the y-axis should show the values for each metric
  (temperature, population, area, and GDP). Use different colored lines to represent
  each metric so we can easily compare the trends across continents. The chart should
  clearly label the axes, include a legend, and have a title that describes the data
  being visualized. Ensure that there are no missing values.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used for the different
  metrics?

  2. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?

  3. Would you like to see grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed)
  for each metric?

  5. Is there a specific format or units you would like to see for the y-axis values?

  6. Do you prefer a particular position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific design elements or themes you would like to incorporate
  into the chart?'
