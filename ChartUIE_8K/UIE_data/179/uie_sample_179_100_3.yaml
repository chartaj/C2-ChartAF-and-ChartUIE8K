initial_prompt: 'I need a box chart visualizing various dance styles and genres focusing
  on these attributes: Learning Difficulty, Hardness Ratio, and Tempo (BPM). Group
  the data by Dance Type, and within each group, show the distribution of Learning
  Difficulty, Hardness Ratio, and Tempo using different colors for each attribute.
  Ensure the box chart clearly shows medians, quartiles, and outliers for better comparison
  among different dance types. This will help understand which dance styles are easier,
  have varied complexity, and are performed at different tempos.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing the attributes
  (Learning Difficulty, Hardness Ratio, Tempo) in the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels within the box chart?

  3. Do you prefer the whiskers in the box chart to represent 1.5 IQR or another method
  for identifying outliers?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the Dance Types to be displayed
  on the box chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the orientation of the box chart (vertical or
  horizontal)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to identify the different attributes, and
  if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  7. Are there any additional visual elements or styles you would like to incorporate
  (e.g., gridlines, background color, font styles)?

  8. Would you like to display specific values (e.g., medians, means) on the boxes,
  and if so, how would you prefer them to be shown?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?'
