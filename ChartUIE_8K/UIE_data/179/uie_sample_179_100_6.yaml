initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of Dance Styles from
  the dataset '179.csv'. It should show the proportion for each unique dance type
  within the "Dance Type" column. Highlight notable dance types such as "American"
  and showcase it in a distinct color for better visibility. Ensure the chart includes
  labels for each dance type and a legend for easy reference. This will help illustrate
  the variety and popularity of different dance styles documented in the dataset.
  The focus should be on presenting a comprehensive overview of the dance styles'
  diversity.
