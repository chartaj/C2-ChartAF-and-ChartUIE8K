initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart for dance styles and genres data. Each
  column should represent a different dance type, stacked with segments for each unique
  dance style, and their cultural significance. The x-axis should showcase the dance
  types (e.g., American), while the y-axis reflects the number of notable characteristics.
  Use different colors for various dance styles and include a legend. The chart will
  help visualize the prominence and variety within each dance type, making it easy
  to compare their key features. This visualization will be useful for understanding
  the diversity and cultural impact of each dance type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different dance styles?

  2. Should the cultural significance be displayed as text on the chart, or is a tooltip
  sufficient?

  3. How detailed should the legend be regarding the different dance styles and cultural
  significance?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels for outliers or
  notable data points?

  5. Do you prefer a particular ordering for the columns on the x-axis (e.g., chronological,
  alphabetical)?

  6. Is there a specific font or style preference for the axis labels and chart title?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included on the chart for better readability?

  8. Should the y-axis be displayed as a count or a percentage of total notable characteristics?'
