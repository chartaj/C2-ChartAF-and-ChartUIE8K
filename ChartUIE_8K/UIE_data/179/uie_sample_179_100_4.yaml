initial_prompt: I want to visualize the dance data with a scatter plot. Please use
  "Tempo (BPM)" on the x-axis and "Hardness Ratio" on the y-axis. Differentiate the
  dance types by using different colors for each "Dance Type." Make sure to add labels
  for the axes and a legend to identify the dance types. This will help me see the
  relationship between the tempo and the perceived difficulty of different dance styles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the dance
  types?

  2. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  3. Do you prefer the axis labels to include units, such as ''Tempo (BPM)'' for the
  x-axis?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the scatter plot for easier reading?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the marker shape or size used in the scatter
  plot?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the scatter plot?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  8. Should we include data point markers for specific famous practitioners or events
  related to some dance types?

  9. Do you prefer the legend to be located in a specific area of the scatter plot
  (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  10. Are there any particular aspects of the data (e.g., outliers or specific ranges)
  that you would like highlighted?'
