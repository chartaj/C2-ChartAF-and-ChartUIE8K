initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the tax brackets over the years for
  different filing statuses using the given data columns. Plot 'Year' on the x-axis
  and tax rates from 'Married Filing Jointly (Rates/Brackets)', 'Married Filing Separately
  (Rates/Brackets)', 'Single Filer (Rates/Brackets)', and 'Head of Household (Rates/Brackets)'
  on the y-axis. Add text annotations for significant tax law changes, especially
  highlighting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This will help in understanding
  how tax rates have changed over time for different filing categories and identify
  any significant shifts or trends.
