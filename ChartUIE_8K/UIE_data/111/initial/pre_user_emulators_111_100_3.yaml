- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n   \n3.\
  \ Highlights:\nDescription: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g.,\
  \ size, color) to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish\
  \ certain elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  It MUST be a chart that can be created using only data columns.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Bar chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Bar chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart comparing different tax rates and brackets across various filing
  statuses for the year 2021. One bar group should represent each filing status (Married
  Filing Jointly, Married Filing Separately, Single Filer, Head of Household), and
  within each group, display bars for each tax rate (10%, 12%, 22%). Each bar height
  should represent the corresponding income threshold for that tax rate in dollars.
  Ensure labels and legends differentiate rates and filing statuses.
