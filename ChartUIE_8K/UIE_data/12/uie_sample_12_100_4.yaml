initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of different
  careers based on the sample data provided. The dataset focuses on psychology and
  aptitude scores. Utilize the "Career" column to show how many individuals belong
  to each career category (e.g., Accountant, Graphic Designer, Salesperson). Ensure
  the chart clearly highlights the proportion of each career in the dataset. Also,
  use distinct colors for each career for better clarity. Since there are multiple
  data formats, ensure the chart is comprehensive and visually informative. Thank
