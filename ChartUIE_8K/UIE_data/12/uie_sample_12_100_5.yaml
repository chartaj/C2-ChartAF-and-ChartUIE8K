initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the average scores of the different
  aptitudes (Numerical, Spatial, Perceptual, Abstract, Verbal) and personality traits
  (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) across various
  careers. Each bar represents the average score for a particular aptitude or trait
  per career. This will help in comparing how different careers align with specific
  aptitudes and personality traits. Use different colors for each category (aptitude
  vs. trait) and ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret. This visualization
  will aid in career counseling and psychological analysis.
