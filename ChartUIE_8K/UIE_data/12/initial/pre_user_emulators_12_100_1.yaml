  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart visualizing the Career Prediction Dataset related to psychology.
  Plot lines for each numerical column like O_score, C_score, E_score, A_score, N_score,
  Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Perceptual Aptitude, Abstract Reasoning, and
  Verbal Reasoning. Annotate key data points to highlight specific values and trends.
  Emphasize important elements like career titles where data intersects significantly.
  The purpose is to understand aptitude and trait variations across different careers,
  helping focus on which scores correlate with specific careers. Provide context with
  additional annotations on crucial plot points for better understanding and relevance.
