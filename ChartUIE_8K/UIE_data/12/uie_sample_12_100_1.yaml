initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the Career Prediction Dataset related
  to psychology. Plot lines for each numerical column like O_score, C_score, E_score,
  A_score, N_score, Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Perceptual Aptitude, Abstract
  Reasoning, and Verbal Reasoning. Annotate key data points to highlight specific
  values and trends. Emphasize important elements like career titles where data intersects
  significantly. The purpose is to understand aptitude and trait variations across
  different careers, helping focus on which scores correlate with specific careers.
  Provide context with additional annotations on crucial plot points for better understanding
  and relevance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different lines representing
  each numerical column?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to be the career titles or another attribute?

  3. Do you prefer the annotations to display the exact numerical values at key data
  points, or just highlight significant trends?

  4. How many key data points do you want annotated per line?

  5. Should the legend for each line be displayed inside the chart or outside the
  chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, etc.)?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  8. Are there any specific careers that you want to focus on or highlight more prominently
  in the chart?

  9. Do you want the chart to have a title and axis labels, and if so, what should
  they be?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the x-axis to be the career titles.

  3. Just highlight significant trends.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, the chart should have a title and axis labels. The title should be "Aptitude
  and Trait Variations Across Careers" and the axis labels should be "Career Titles"
  for the x-axis and "Scores" for the y-axis.'
