initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the career prediction dataset.
  Plot each psychological score (O_score, C_score, E_score, A_score, N_score) on separate
  axes against Aptitude scores (Numerical, Spatial, Perceptual, Abstract, Verbal)
  to see correlations. Use text annotations to highlight key data points, such as
  outliers or significant clusters, based on specific careers. Ensure significant
  data points related to unique careers are highlighted to draw attention. The visualization
  should help understand how psychological and aptitude scores relate to various careers,
  providing practical insight for career guidance in psychology contexts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer a specific marker style for the scatter plot points?

  3. Should each psychological score and aptitude score pair be differentiated by
  specific colors or markers?

  4. Do you prefer a specific size for the markers for better visibility?

  5. Do you have any preference regarding the font style and size for the text annotations?

  6. Should the career data points have a unique symbol or color?

  7. How would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot? If so, do you have a style preference?

  9. Would you like a legend to differentiate the various psychological scores and
  aptitude scores?

  10. Do you have a preference for the axes'' scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  11. Do you want titles and labels for each axis? If so, what should they be?

  12. Should there be an overall title for the scatter plot? If so, what would you
  like it to be?

  13. Would you like to add reference lines for mean or median values of scores on
  the scatter plot?

  14. Do you have any preferences for the background of the scatter plot (e.g., color,
  pattern)?'
