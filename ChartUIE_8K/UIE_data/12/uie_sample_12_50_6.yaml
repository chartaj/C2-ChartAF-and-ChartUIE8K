initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to analyze the correlation between O_score, C_score,
  E_score, A_score, N_score, Numerical Aptitude, Spatial Aptitude, Perceptual Aptitude,
  Abstract Reasoning, Verbal Reasoning, and Career trends. Use the provided dataset
  for accurate representation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a color legend to indicate the strength of the correlations?

  3. Do you prefer the heatmap to display numerical values within the cells?

  4. Would you like the correlation values to be rounded to a specific number of decimal
  places?

  5. Should the axes labels (data attributes) be displayed at a particular orientation
  (horizontal or vertical)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale used in the heatmap (e.g., absolute values,
  normalized)?

  7. Are there specific ranges or thresholds within the correlations that you want
  highlighted with distinct colors?

  8. Should the heatmap include axis titles or any additional annotations?

  9. Do you require a specific size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  10. Is there a need for any grid lines or delineations between cells in the heatmap?

  11. Would you like any specific font type or size for the labels and titles?

  12. Do you have any preference for the layout of the heatmap (e.g., clustering similar
  attributes together)?

  13. Should the heatmap include a title or caption? If yes, what should it be?'
