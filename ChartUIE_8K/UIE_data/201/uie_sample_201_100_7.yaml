initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the World Happiness Report 2023
  data. Use the 'Country name' for the geographic locations and 'Ladder score' for
  the color gradient, indicating the happiness levels in each country. Highlight countries
  with higher Ladder scores in darker shades and lower scores in lighter shades. Include
  additional layers for 'Logged GDP per capita', 'Social support', and 'Healthy life
  expectancy' for detailed insights. Ensure the map is interactive, allowing users
  to hover over each country to see these variables' exact values and other relevant
  details.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color gradient?

  2. Would you like to include labels or tooltips showing the country names on the
  map?

  3. Should the additional layers (''Logged GDP per capita'', ''Social support'',
  ''Healthy life expectancy'') be displayed as separate layers or combined into a
  single tooltip?

  4. Do you have a specific range for the "Ladder score" colors, such as specific
  values for the darkest and lightest shades?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or key to help interpret the color gradient
  and additional layers?

  6. Is there a particular geographic projection you prefer for visualizing the world
  map?

  7. Would you like any specific HTML or CSS styling elements on the map?'
