initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the data from the World Happiness
  Report 2023. The x-axis should represent the 'Country name' and the y-axis should
  show the 'Ladder score'. Include lines for 'Logged GDP per capita', 'Social support',
  and 'Healthy life expectancy' for each country. Highlight the changes and relationships
  between these variables for Finland, Denmark, and Iceland. Make sure to use different
  colors and markers for each line to differentiate them clearly. This will help visualize
  how economic performance and social factors influence the overall happiness score.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you want for
  each line?

  2. What markers would you like to use for each of the lines?

  3. Would you like to include data labels for the points on the lines?

  4. Should the chart include a title? If so, what should it be?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, in which direction (vertical, horizontal,
  or both)?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the chart text?

  8. Should there be any specific annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key
  points?

  9. Do you wish to include a legend on the chart? If so, where should it be placed?

  and Iceland for comparison?'
