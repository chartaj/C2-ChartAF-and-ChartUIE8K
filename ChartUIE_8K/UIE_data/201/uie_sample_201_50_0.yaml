initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the ladder score of various countries.
  Highlight countries with the highest and lowest scores. Include text annotations

  and key factors like GDP, social support, and healthy life expectancy.

  2. Do you have a specific gradient range in mind for the ladder scores?

  3. How would you like the highest and lowest scores to be highlighted (e.g., specific

  inside the cells, adjacent to the cells, or in a dedicated legend)?

  5. How would you like the key factors like GDP, social support, and healthy life
  expectancy to be displayed (e.g., as tooltips, note boxes, or additional columns)?

  axes?

  7. Do you have any preference for the level of detail in the annotations (e.g.,
  display exact values vs. general indicators)?

  8. Should the heatmap include a legend or a color bar to explain the ladder score
  range?

  9. Do you have any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the annotations
  and labels?
