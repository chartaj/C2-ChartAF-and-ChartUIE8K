initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing data from the World Happiness
  Report 2023. Use "Ladder score" as the y-axis and "Logged GDP per capita" as the
  x-axis. Annotate the top three countries (Finland, Denmark, Iceland) with text annotations
  to highlight their ladder scores. Highlight these points to make them stand out.
  This visualization should underscore the relationship between GDP and happiness,
  offering insights into how economic factors correlate with overall life satisfaction.
  The scatter plot should clearly demonstrate which countries are highest on the happiness
  ladder, contextualized with their GDP levels.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the axes to have specific labels or titles beyond ''Ladder score''
  and ''Logged GDP per capita''?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or any specific background style?

  5. How would you like the highlighted countries (Finland, Denmark, Iceland) to be
  visually differentiated (e.g., color, shape, size)?

  6. Do you want any specific legend or key to be included in the chart?

  7. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the scatter plot?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers (e.g., average
  lines, trend line)?

  9. Should the data points have tooltips or labels displaying additional information
  when hovered over?

  10. Is there a preferred format for displaying numerical data (e.g., decimal places,
  comma separators)?'
