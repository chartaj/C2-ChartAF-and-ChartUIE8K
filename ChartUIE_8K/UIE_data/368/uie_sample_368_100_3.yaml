initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between different
  age groups and suicide rates from the dataset "Suicide Rates Overview 1985 to 2016."
  Focus on countries, years, and sexes to see how these factors influence the suicide
  numbers across different generations. Highlight the "suicides/100k pop" to emphasize
  rates normalized by population. Include color gradients where higher suicide rates
  have warmer colors. Ensure to annotate missing data like 'HDI for year' distinctly.
  The goal is to uncover patterns and risk factors linked with suicides across various
  demographics and socio-economic contexts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap other than the
  default one?

  2. How would you like the missing data for ''HDI for year'' to be annotated (e.g.,
  a specific color or pattern)?

  3. Do you want to include axis labels and titles? If yes, any specific text for
  them?

  4. Should we include a legend that explains the color gradient? If yes, where would
  you like it positioned?

  5. Would you like the data to be grouped by specific intervals for age or year?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for annotations and labels?

  7. Are there any specific countries, years, or sex categories you want to highlight
  or focus on more than others?

  8. Should we standardize the heatmap scale across all countries or allow it to vary
  by country?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markings you''d like to include (e.g.,
  trends, key statistics)?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the chartâ€™s layout or dimensions?'
