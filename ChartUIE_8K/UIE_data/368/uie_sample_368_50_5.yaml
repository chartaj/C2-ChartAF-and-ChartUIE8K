initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize global suicide rates from 1985
  to 2016 using the provided dataset. Include country-wise data for different years,
  categories by sex and age groups, and color gradients representing the suicide rates
  per 100k population.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the choropleth map?

  2. Should the color gradient be linear or logarithmic to represent the suicide rates?

  3. Do you have specific boundary lines or regions that need to be highlighted?

  4. Do you want any specific geographical details (like country borders or major
  cities) emphasized on the map?

  5. Should the map include a legend explaining the color gradient and corresponding
  suicide rates?

  6. Do you require any annotations or labels for certain countries or regions?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like the age groups to be displayed on the
  map?

  8. How would you like the sex categories to be represented on the map (e.g., through
  color, pattern, or separate maps)?

  9. Do you have any preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  etc.)?

  10. Do you want to include additional data layers, such as GDP or HDI, for context?'
