initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize suicide rates from 1985 to 2016,
  broken down by country and gender. Highlight key trends and annotate significant
  peaks or drops in suicide numbers. Include annotations to emphasize data points
  for specific age groups and GDP per capita correlations. The chart should draw attention
  to the varying impact on different generations and allow for comparing countries.
  This visualization aims to provide a clear, contextual overview for social scientists
  to analyze demographic and economic factors influencing suicide rates over time.

  2. How should different countries be distinguished (e.g., different line styles
  or colors)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for annotations?

  4. Are there any specific age groups or time periods you want to emphasize more?

  5. How should the GDP per capita be represented and correlated in the chart?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be for significant peaks or drops in suicide
  numbers?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading to improve readability?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  9. How do you prefer to handle missing data, if any, in the dataset?

  10. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?'
