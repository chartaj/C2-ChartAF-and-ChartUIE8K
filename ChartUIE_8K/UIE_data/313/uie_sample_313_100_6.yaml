initial_prompt: I need a dot plot using the provided world population data. The x-axis
  should show different years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2022).
  The y-axis should show population values. Each dot should represent the population
  of a country or territory for a particular year. Different colors can be used for
  different continents to make the plot visually informative. The size of the dots
  can vary based on the density per km². Please ensure that the chart clearly shows
  population trends over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for different continents?

  2. Should the density per km² be reflected in the size of the dots linearly or using
  a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling or annotation for the dots representing countries
  or territories?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to indicate which colors correspond to which
  continents?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  diagonal, vertical)?

  6. Would you prefer a specific range or format for the y-axis labels for better
  clarity?

  7. Is there a particular style or format for the gridlines that you prefer on the
  chart?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s title and axis titles?

  9. Should we include any additional statistical or trend lines in the dot plot?'
