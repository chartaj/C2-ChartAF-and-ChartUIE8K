initial_prompt: Create a box chart to compare the population growth rates across different
  continents from 1970 to 2022 using the available dataset. The x-axis should represent
  the continents, and the y-axis should show the population growth rate percentages.
  Ensure each box in the box chart reflects the distribution of population growth
  rates for each continent over the provided time periods. Highlight any outliers
  and variations in the growth rates. This will help visualize how different continents
  have experienced population growth differently over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations on outliers and variations?

  3. What level of detail do you prefer for axis labels (e.g., numerical precision,
  percentages)?

  4. Are there any specific continents or regions you would like to highlight or differentiate
  in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend or accompanying notes?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like to include on the chart?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be displayed or hidden in the background?

  9. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text in the
  chart?

  10. Do you prefer the y-axis to use a specific scale, such as linear or logarithmic?'
