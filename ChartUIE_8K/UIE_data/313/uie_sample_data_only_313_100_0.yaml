02_initial_prompt: Visualize the population growth trends of Afghanistan, Albania,
  and Algeria from 1970 to 2022 using a line chart. Annotate significant data points,
  such as population spikes or dips, to highlight key changes. Emphasize the continents
  by using different colors for each country. Highlight the overall growth rates and
  world population percentages to provide context. This visualization will help compare
  the trends and growth rates among these countries, helping us understand global
  population dynamics over time.
