initial_prompt: Create a Treemap chart displaying the world population by country/territory
  from 1970 to 2022. Highlight countries with the largest and smallest populations
  in 2022. Include text annotations for notable population growth rates and densities.
  The purpose of this visualization is to provide an overview of population distribution
  and growth trends globally. Ensuring the visualization is informative for social
  science research on global population dynamics would be helpful. Make sure the chart
  is visually engaging and emphasizes significant data points to facilitate better
  understanding and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the largest and
  smallest populations?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding and size representation?

  3. Where would you like the text annotations for notable population growth rates
  and densities to be placed?

  4. Do you want to use specific fonts or styles for the text annotations?

  5. Would you prefer the treemap to be sorted in any specific order (e.g., by 2022
  population size)?

  6. How would you like to display changes in population over the years; should there
  be a gradient or another visual indicator?

  7. Do you want to include any interactive elements like tooltips to show additional
  details on hover?

  8. Should the countries/territories be grouped by continent or any other specific
  category?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the color coding and size representation.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, the treemap should be sorted by 2022 population size.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No, I am looking for an image, not an interactive data visualization.

  8. I am not sure.'
