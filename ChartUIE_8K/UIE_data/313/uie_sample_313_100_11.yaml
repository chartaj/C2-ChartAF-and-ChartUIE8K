initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the provided population data for
  different countries and years. Plot the '2022 Population' on the X-axis and '2020
  Population' on the Y-axis. Use different colors to represent different continents.
  Ensure that each point is labeled with the corresponding 'Country/Territory'. Also,
  include a legend that identifies each continent by color. This visualization will
  help in comparing the population growth of countries from 2020 to 2022 across different
  continents. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette used to represent
  different continents?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the country/territory labels?

  3. Do you prefer the country/territory labels to be displayed at all times or only
  upon hovering over a point?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot? If so, do you have
  any preferences for their style or color?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the axes titles and labels, such as
  font style or size?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the scatter plot? If so,
  do you have any preferences for its font size and style?

  7. Would you like to include data point markers (e.g., circles, squares) or use
  different marker shapes for different continents?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the scatter plot?

  9. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the plot (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or information on the scatter
  plot?'
