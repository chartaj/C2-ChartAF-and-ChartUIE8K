initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the provided world population data.
  Focus on visualizing the populations of Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria from 1970
  to 2022. Include annotations to highlight significant population growth or decline
  in specific years for these countries. Use different colors to represent each country
  and include highlights to emphasize population peaks and dips. The purpose is to
  easily compare the population changes over time for these three countries and understand
  their growth trends. This will help in social science research and global demographic
  studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the countries?

  2. Do you want the bar chart to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. Are there specific years you consider critical for highlighting significant growth
  or decline?

  4. What kind of annotations would you prefer (e.g., text, icons, arrows)?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. How would you like the peaks and dips to be highlighted (e.g., color change,
  markers)?

  8. Are there any additional statistical details you want to be included in the chart
  (e.g., growth rate)?

  9. Would you prefer the chart to include a legend, and if so, where should it be
  positioned?

  10. Are there any specific title or axis label preferences you have in mind?'
