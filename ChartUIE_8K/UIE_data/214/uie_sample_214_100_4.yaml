initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  population and the number of suicides across different age groups and sexes from
  various countries over the years. The x-axis should represent the population and
  the y-axis should represent the number of suicides. Different colors should represent
  different age groups, and different markers should represent different sexes (male
  and female). Please ensure to clean the data by handling the missing values appropriately
  before plotting. This will help in understanding any patterns in suicide rates across
  demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for different age groups?

  2. What specific markers would you like to use for the different sexes?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines? If yes, do you have a preference for their
  style (dotted, solid, etc.)?

  4. Would you like to include a trend line on the scatter plot to better visualize
  the correlation?

  5. Do you prefer logarithmic scaling for any of the axes to better handle wide-ranging
  data?

  6. How would you prefer the missing values to be handled (e.g., removed, imputed)?

  7. Do you require any annotations or labels on specific data points?

  8. Should the chart include a legend? If so, do you have a preferred position for
  it on the chart?

  9. Do you want to include axis labels and titles? If yes, what should they specifically
  say?

  10. Would you like to include any specific descriptive statistics or summary information
  on the chart?'
