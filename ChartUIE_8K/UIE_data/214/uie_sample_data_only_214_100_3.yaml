  I want a box chart visualizing the relationship between suicide numbers and population
  across different age groups and genders. Please use the WHO Suicide Statistics data.
  Let''s identify any outliers in the suicide rates over the years for various countries
  by breaking it down into male and female categories and across different age ranges.
  Highlight the distribution and spread of suicide numbers within these groups. Ensure
  the chart clearly represents data over the years to observe any trends or anomalies.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
