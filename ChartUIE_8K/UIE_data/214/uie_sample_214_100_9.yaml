initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the total number of suicides per country
  using the WHO Suicide Statistics data. For each country, aggregate the suicide numbers
  by summing up all records for every year, sex, and age group. Ensure the y-axis
  represents the total number of suicides and the x-axis lists the countries. Highlight
  countries with the highest and lowest suicide numbers in contrasting colors. Add
  labels and a title to improve clarity and context. By visualizing this, we aim to
  gain insights into the geographic distribution of suicide prevalence globally.
