initial_prompt: Please create a choropleth map visualizing the WHO suicide statistics
  data. Highlight countries based on the number of suicides per population for different
  years to show trends over time. Use annotations to indicate countries with the highest
  and lowest suicide rates and any notable changes. This visualization aims to provide
  insights into global suicide patterns, highlighting demographic differences like
  age and sex where data is missing. Ensure colors are used effectively to distinguish
  varying suicide rates and maintain viewer focus on highlighted areas. The map should
  be clear, informative, and include contextual annotations for deeper understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for distinguishing varying
  suicide rates?

  2. How would you prefer the annotations for highest and lowest suicide rates to
  be displayed (e.g., text labels, icons)?

  3. Should the map include any specific geographical regions or countries as focal
  points?

  4. Are there particular years that should be emphasized or highlighted in the trend
  analysis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the map projection style (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  6. How detailed should the age and sex demographic information be in the contextual
  annotations?

  7. Would you like a legend or color scale to be included, and if so, where should
  it be positioned?

  8. Should missing data be represented in a specific way (e.g., different color,
  pattern)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Text labels would be preferable.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have specific years in mind to emphasize.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Highlighting broad categories like ''youth'' and ''elderly'' along with ''male''
  and ''female'' should be sufficient.

  7. Yes, a legend or color scale should be included. I have no specific preference
  for its position.

  8. I am not sure.'
