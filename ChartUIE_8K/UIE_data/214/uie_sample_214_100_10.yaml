initial_prompt: I am working on a project analyzing global suicide statistics by age
  and sex. I have a dataset with columns like country, year, sex, age, suicides_no,
  and population. I need a population pyramid chart showing the distribution of the
  population across different age groups and sexes for one specific country, preferably
  Albania, in the year 1985. The chart should highlight both the male and female populations
  in these age categories. The purpose is to provide a visual representation of the
  data for easier understanding and comparison. This will help in observing population
  distribution patterns related to suicide statistics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to differentiate between
  male and female populations?

  2. Would you like to include labels or data values directly on the bars of the population
  pyramid?

  3. Should the chart have a specific title or subtitle?

  4. Do you want to include any specific annotations or highlights on the chart to
  emphasize certain age groups or trends?

  5. Would you prefer a horizontal or vertical layout for the population pyramid?

  6. Are there any specific stylistic elements you would like, such as gridlines or
  background shading?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include labels or data values directly on the bars.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I prefer a horizontal layout for the population pyramid.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.'
