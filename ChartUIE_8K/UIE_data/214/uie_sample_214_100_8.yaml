initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap using the WHO Suicide Statistics dataset.
  The heatmap should visualize the suicides_no across different countries over the
  years, categorized by sex and age groups. Highlight areas with missing values to
  identify data gaps. Color intensity should represent the number of suicides. Make
  sure the data ranges are clear and the chart is easy to understand. Save the final
  visualization as a PNG file.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific range of years to focus on or include all available
  years?

  3. Should we use a specific color to highlight missing values?

  4. Do you have any preferred method for annotating the heatmap values (e.g., numerical
  values on tiles)?

  5. Is there a specific order or grouping you''d like for the countries, age groups,
  or sexes?

  6. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  7. Do you want to include a legend or key to explain the color intensity representing
  the number of suicides?

  8. Should the heatmap include gridlines or dividers to separate sections clearly?

  9. Would you like to display any additional statistical summaries or trends alongside
  the heatmap?'
