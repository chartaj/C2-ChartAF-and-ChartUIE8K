initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the WHO Suicide Statistics
  data. Specifically, I want to see the distribution of suicide numbers (suicides_no)
  across different age groups (age) for each country. Highlight the proportion of
  missing suicide data within each age group. This chart should help understand which
  age groups are most affected by suicides and where there are gaps in the data. Use
  contrasting colors for clear differentiation. Make sure it's visually intuitive
  and includes a legend for the age groups and missing data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the age groups?

  2. How would you like the missing data to be indicated (e.g., specific color, pattern)?

  3. Should the age groups be ordered in a specific way (e.g., by age range, ascending/descending
  order)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for labels and legends?

  5. Should the chart include any specific titles or subtitles for better context?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the donut chart?

  7. Would you like to include percentage labels on the donut chart segments, and
  if so, do you have specific formatting preferences for these labels?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the age groups.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a specific color or pattern for missing data would be good.

  3. I do not know, maybe ordering by age range.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  5. Yes, please include titles or subtitles for better context if possible.

  6. I have no specific preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the donut
  chart.

  7. Yes, please include percentage labels on the donut chart segments, but I do not
  have specific formatting preferences for these labels.'
