initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the 'Electric Vehicle Population'
  by county in Washington state as of February 29, 2020. Use different colors to differentiate
  between 'Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs)' and 'Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles
  (PHEVs)' within each county's total vehicles. Add text annotations to highlight
  counties with the highest and lowest percentages of electric vehicles. Ensure the
  chart includes labels for 'County,' 'State,' 'Vehicle Primary Use,' and 'Percent
  Electric Vehicles.' This visualization will help understand the distribution and
  adoption of electric vehicles across different counties in Washington state.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between ''Battery
  Electric Vehicles (BEVs)'' and ''Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs)''?

  4. How would you like the counties with the highest and lowest percentages of electric
  vehicles to be highlighted (e.g., bold text, different color, larger font)?

  5. Do you have a preferred chart orientation (horizontal or vertical stacked column)?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, where should it be placed
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the style of gridlines or no gridlines at all?

  in the chart?

  10. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., ''WA'' for Washington state or
