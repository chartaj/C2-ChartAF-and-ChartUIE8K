initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the number of speakers for different
  languages. Include text annotations for languages with over 50 million speakers
  to highlight their significance. Use different colors to represent different language
  families for clear visual distinction. The purpose is to understand the distribution
  and prominence of languages spoken globally. This visualization will provide insight
  into linguistic diversity and help identify major languages. Highlight regions and
  writing systems where necessary, but focus on speaker numbers primarily. This will
  aid in linguistic studies and cultural research by providing a clear, visual understanding
  of world languages.

  families?

  families?

  4. Do you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for the line chart?

  5. Are there any specific regions or writing systems you would like to highlight
  more prominently than others?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the speaker numbers
  on the chart?

  7. How should the axes be labeled, particularly the Y-axis for speaker numbers?

  8. Do you want to set any specific axis scales (linear or logarithmic) for better
  visualization of the speaker numbers?'
