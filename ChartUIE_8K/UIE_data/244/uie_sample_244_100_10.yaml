initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of languages
  by their family from the World Languages Dataset. Make sure the sections of the
  donut chart represent the unique language families listed in the dataset. Each section
  should illustrate the number of languages that belong to each family. Additionally,
  include a distinct color for each language family to clearly differentiate them.
  This visualization should help in understanding the diversity and frequency of language
  families around the world. Please ensure the chart is aesthetically pleasing and
  easy to interpret. Thank you!
