  4. How should the writing systems be indicated on the map (e.g., specific icons,
  text labels, color codes)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend explaining the different elements such as
  speaker density, language families, and writing systems?

  6. Do you prefer any specific map projection for the choropleth map (e.g., Mercator,
