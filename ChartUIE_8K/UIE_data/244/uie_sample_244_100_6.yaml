initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the 🌍📚 World Languages Dataset 🌍📚. Use "Speakers"
  as the x-axis and "Unique Values" for each column from the summary as markers. This
  will help visualize the relationship between the number of speakers and the uniqueness
  of language attributes. Ensure different colors or markers distinguish "Family"
  and "Region" for clarity. Add labels to data points for "Language" and "ISO Code".
  Also, include a legend and title "Language Uniqueness vs. Number of Speakers". The
  chart should be clear and informative for linguistic analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing ''Family''
  and ''Region'' on the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer certain shapes for the markers to represent different ''Family''
  and ''Region'' categories?

  3. Would you like the labels for ''Language'' and ''ISO Code'' to have specific
  font styles or sizes?

  4. Is there any particular font or size you prefer for the chart title "Language
  Uniqueness vs. Number of Speakers"?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement or format of the legend?

  6. Are there any axis label styles or formatting you would like to specify for the
  ''Speakers'' axis?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the background of the scatter plot, and if so, do you
  have any specific preferences for their appearance?

  8. Is there a preferred ordering or layout for the data points if multiple points
  have the same ''Speakers'' value?'
