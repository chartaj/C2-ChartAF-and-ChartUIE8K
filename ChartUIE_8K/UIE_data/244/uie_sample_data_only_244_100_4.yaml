02_initial_prompt: Could you please create a box plot chart visualizing the 'Speakers'
  column data from the World Languages Dataset? This dataset contains information
  about languages, their families, regions, number of speakers, writing systems, and
  ISO codes. I want the chart to show the distribution of the number of speakers among
  the different languages. It should clearly mark outliers, if any, and display the
  median, quartiles, and possible extremes. Including proper labels and a legend will
  be helpful for clarity. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
