initial_prompt: Could you please create a box plot chart visualizing the 'Speakers'
  column data from the World Languages Dataset? This dataset contains information
  about languages, their families, regions, number of speakers, writing systems, and
  ISO codes. I want the chart to show the distribution of the number of speakers among
  the different languages. It should clearly mark outliers, if any, and display the
  median, quartiles, and possible extremes. Including proper labels and a legend will
  be helpful for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the box plot chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better clarity?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the box plot?

  4. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color?

  5. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box plot (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the axes to have a certain range or scale?

  8. Is there a particular style or font you''d like for the labels and legend?'
