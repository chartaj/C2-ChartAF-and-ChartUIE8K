initial_prompt: '<start of data example format>

  Create a choropleth map visualizing the number of speakers by region using the World
  Languages Dataset. Highlight regions with the top three languages by speaker count
  to emphasize major languages. Add text annotations for these regions to provide
  context and specific data points like language names and speaker numbers. Use distinct
  colors to make these regions stand out. This visualization will help in understanding
  the distribution and prevalence of major languages across different regions. Ensure
  textual annotations provide detailed insights while making it visually appealing
  for better comprehension.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or color schemes for the
  choropleth map?

  2. How would you prefer the top three regions to be highlighted (e.g., border thickness,
  different shades)?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the textual annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations include any particular formatting (e.g., bold, italic)
  to emphasize certain data points?

  5. Are there any specific size requirements for the text annotations to ensure readability?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding on the map?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout or placement for the textual annotations on the
  map?

  8. Is there a specific map projection you would like to be used for the choropleth
  map?'
