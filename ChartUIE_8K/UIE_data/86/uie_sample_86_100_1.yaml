initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the Spotify Song Attributes data.
  The histogram should display the distribution of 'danceability' scores among the
  songs. Use text annotations to highlight the mean value of 'danceability' and any
  notable outliers. Additionally, use visual highlights such as color changes to emphasize
  these annotated points. The purpose of this visualization is to understand the overall
  danceability trend in the dataset, helping to see if most songs are generally danceable
  or not. This will give insights into the general tempo and rhythm trends in popular
  songs.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific range of ''danceability'' scores that you would
  like to focus on in the histogram?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for highlighting the mean value and outliers
  in the histogram?

  3. Are there specific bin widths or number of bins you would prefer for the histogram?

  4. Would you prefer to include any labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the histogram (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed, color palette)?

  6. Would you like the mean value and outliers to be annotated with specific labels
  or text descriptions? If yes, please specify.

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the text annotations?

  8. Do you want any additional statistics or metrics displayed on the histogram besides
  the mean value and outliers?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer a blue color for highlighting the mean value and a red color for
  outliers.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include labels for the x-axis as ''Danceability Scores'' and the
  y-axis as ''Number of Songs''.
