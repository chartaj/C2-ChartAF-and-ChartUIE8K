initial_prompt: I want a bar chart visualizing the energy levels of popular songs.
  The x-axis should represent song titles and the y-axis should depict energy values.
  Highlight songs with energy above 0.4. Include data-driven text annotations displaying
  the exact energy values above the respective bars for clarity. This visualization
  will help understand which songs are more energetic. The chart is intended to offer
  a clear comparison of the energy attribute across different songs in a visually
  engaging manner. Please make sure the chart is colorful and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the high-energy songs (energy above 0.4) to be highlighted
  - different color, pattern, or any other way?

  3. Would you like the bars to be displayed in a particular order (e.g., alphabetically
  by song title, descending by energy level)?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to be in a specific size or aspect ratio?

  6. Do you want to include a legend in the chart?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles?

  8. Do you have any preference for the style of the axis lines and grid lines (e.g.,
  dashed, solid)?

  9. Any preferences for the number formatting of the energy values (e.g., decimal
  points, percentage format)?

  10. Would you like any additional information or elements included in the chart,
  such as the artist''s name?'
