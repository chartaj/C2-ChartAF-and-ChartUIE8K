initial_prompt: Create a box plot of Spotify song attributes to visualize the distribution
  and variation of acousticness, danceability, energy, and valence across the dataset.
  Include data-driven text annotations to highlight the median values for each attribute,
  emphasizing key insights. Use highlights to distinguish the quartile ranges and
  outliers, making these elements stand out visually. The purpose is to understand
  the typical values and spread of these musical attributes for better insights into
  trends and patterns in songs. This will help identify how these attributes vary
  and which songs might be potential hits.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing between quartile
  ranges and outliers?

  2. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations highlighting
  the median values?

  3. Are there any particular styles or formats you prefer for the text annotations
  (e.g., bold, italic, colored)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the box plot? If so, should they be
  light or bold?

  5. Do you have a preferred overall size or aspect ratio for the box plot?

  6. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would like to be used for clarity?

  7. Should the outliers be represented by specific markers or symbols? If yes, please
  specify your preference.

  8. Do you want to include any background shading or highlighting to improve readability?

  9. Is there a preference for the order in which the attributes (acousticness, danceability,
  energy, valence) are displayed on the plot?

  10. Would you like a legend to be included to explain the highlights and annotations,
  or should the annotations suffice?

  11. Do you prefer any additional stylistic elements, such as borders around the
  box plot or shadows for depth?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  as the title.

  7. Specific markers for outliers would be useful but I am not sure which kind.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. No specific order preference.

  10. The annotations should suffice.

  11. I do not have a specific preference.'
