initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart using the Spotify Song Attributes dataset.
  Plot the song titles on the x-axis and the following attributes on the y-axis: danceability,
  energy, and valence. Use different colored lines for each attribute to easily distinguish
  them. This will help visualize how these attributes vary across different songs
  by Future and Childish Gambino. Ensure the chart is clearly labeled with legends
  for each attribute, and provide a title like "Comparison of Danceability, Energy,
  and Valence Across Songs". Thank you!'
