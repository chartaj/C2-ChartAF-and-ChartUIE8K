  4. Should the heatmap include labels for both the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be shown between the cells of the heatmap?

  7. Do you want a title for the heatmap? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  8. Do you have any font preferences for the labels and titles on the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to include a legend indicating the correlation strength?'
