initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  danceability and energy for songs in the Spotify dataset. Each point should represent
  a song, with danceability on the x-axis and energy on the y-axis. Please include
  different colors to distinguish between the 'target' values. A legend explaining
  the colors for target values would be helpful as well. Include axis labels and a
  title for the scatter plot. The chart should help understand how these attributes
  correlate with the target variable.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme to be used
  for distinguishing the ''target'' values?

  2. Is there a particular title you would like for the scatter plot?

  3. What specific labels would you prefer for the x-axis and the y-axis?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or theme for the scatter plot (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed, colorful)?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or specific points to be highlighted
  in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you want any specific formatting for the legend explaining the colors for
  ''target'' values?'
