initial_prompt: I have a Spotify song attributes dataset. I'd like to visualize the
  average danceability, energy, and valence scores of songs grouped by artist. Create
  a grouped bar chart comparing these attributes for each artist. Ensure that the
  chart has a clear legend, axis labels, and a title. Highlight key differences in
  these attributes between artists. Use different colors for each attribute in the
  grouped bars to differentiate them easily. This will help me understand how different
  artists' songs compare regarding these key musical features.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for each attribute (danceability,
  energy, valence)?

  2. What specific title would you like for the chart?

  3. Do you have any preference for the style or font of the axis labels and legend?

  4. How would you prefer the artists to be ordered on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by average danceability, custom order)?

  5. Would you like the y-axis to start at zero or adjust to the minimum value of
  the data range for better visibility?

  6. Are there any specific artists you would like to highlight in the chart?

  7. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Any specific dimensions or aspect ratio for the chart?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific preference for colors.

  2. The title could be "Average Danceability, Energy, and Valence Scores by Artist".

  3. I am not sure about the style or font.

  4. Artists can be ordered alphabetically.

  5. The y-axis can start at zero.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, I would like gridlines for better readability.

  8. I have no specific preference for the dimensions or aspect ratio.'
