2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing sunspot numbers over time, with points representing
  each month. Highlight periods with exceptionally high or low sunspot counts to emphasize
  trends and unusual activity. Use text annotations to display the exact sunspot numbers
  at specific points, particularly highlighting the maximum and minimum values. This
  will help to easily identify and focus on key data points. Ensure the chart is clear
  and visually appealing to engage space and astronomy enthusiasts, providing them
  with insights into solar activity patterns over the years.
