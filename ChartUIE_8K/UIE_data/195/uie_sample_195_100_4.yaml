initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing monthly mean total sunspot numbers spanning
  from 1749 to 2021. Could you create a line chart showing the trend of sunspot numbers
  over this period? The x-axis should represent time (Date), and the y-axis the monthly
  mean total sunspot number. I am interested in visualizing any noticeable changes
  or patterns in sunspot activity across the years. Since there are a lot of data
  points, please ensure the graph is appropriately sized for clarity and readability,
  possibly with interactive elements for detailed exploration. Also, include axis
  labels and a title. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to add any specific subtitle to the chart?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for the line in the chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the line (e.g., dashed, solid, dotted)?

  5. Would you like to include markers on the data points of the line chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for axis labels and the
  title?

  7. Would you like any gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  8. How would you prefer to handle the display of dates on the x-axis given the long
  timeline (e.g., major ticks for specific decades/centuries)?

  9. Do you want to include any annotations for specific events or periods of interest
  on the chart?

  10. Should the y-axis start at zero, or automatically adjust to the data range for
  better visualization of changes?'
