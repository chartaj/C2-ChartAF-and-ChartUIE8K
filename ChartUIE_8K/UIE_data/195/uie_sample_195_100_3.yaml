initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing the Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number
  from 1749 onwards. Please create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of
  sunspot numbers over the years. Specifically, I want to see how these distributions
  have changed over centuries. I imagine partitioning the data by century or decades
  could highlight any long-term trends or patterns in sunspot activity. Ensure that
  the x-axis represents time (years), and the y-axis shows the Monthly Mean Total
  Sunspot Numbers. This will help in understanding the long-term variability in solar
  activity. Thank you!
questions: '1. How would you like the centuries or decades to be labeled on the x-axis?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the violin plot?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range, or should it adjust automatically based
  on the data?

  5. Do you want any specific annotations or markers indicating significant historical
  events related to solar activity on the chart?

  6. Should the plot include a legend explaining different segments, if applicable?

  7. Is there any preference for the overall style of the plot (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, academic)?

  8. Do you need to display the data points within the violin plot or keep it focused
  on the distribution shape?

  9. Would you like to include summary statistics (mean, median) on the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer a color palette that is easy on the eyes, maybe shades of blue or green.

  3. Yes, I would like grid lines for better readability.

  4. The y-axis should adjust automatically based on the data.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Keep it focused on the distribution shape.

  9. Yes, include summary statistics like mean and median.'
