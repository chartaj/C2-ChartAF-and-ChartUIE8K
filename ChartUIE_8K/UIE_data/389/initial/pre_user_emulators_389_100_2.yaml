2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart showing Internet Users by Country. Each bar should represent
  a country, with the height indicating the number of internet users. Add text annotations
  for the United States, China, and Germany, highlighting their specific user numbers.
  Use highlights to emphasize the countries with the highest and lowest numbers of
  internet users to draw attention to these facts. This visualization will help compare
  internet usage across different countries and identify significant trends or disparities
  in technology adoption. Focus on making it clear and easy to understand.
