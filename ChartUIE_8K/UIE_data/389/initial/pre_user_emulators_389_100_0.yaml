2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a Treemap visualization showing Internet Users by Country. Use the provided
  data to map each country into proportionate blocks based on the number of internet
  users. Highlight countries like the United States, China, and Germany for a detailed
  look at their data points. Add text annotations to display the exact number of internet
  users for these highlighted countries to draw the viewer's attention. The primary
  goal is to understand the global distribution of internet usage, visually emphasizing
  areas with high user counts. Make sure the color scheme aids in distinguishing countries
  easily.
