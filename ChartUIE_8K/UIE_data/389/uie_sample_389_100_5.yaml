initial_prompt: I'd like to see a dot plot visualizing the number of Internet users
  by country. Each dot should represent a country, with the position on the horizontal
  axis showing the country name and the position on the vertical axis showing the
  number of Internet users. The chart should clearly indicate which countries have
  the highest and lowest numbers of Internet users. Based on the data, countries like
  the United States, China, and Germany should have notable placements. Please ensure
  the countries are listed clearly and the dots are easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the dots or the chart background?

  2. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for better readability?

  3. Should the country names on the horizontal axis be fully spelled out or abbreviated?

  4. Do you want any specific labels or annotations for countries with the highest
  and lowest number of Internet users?

  5. Would you like to include a title and axis labels for the chart?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the countries to appear on the horizontal
  axis (e.g., alphabetical, by number of Internet users)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the axis labels and country
  names?

  8. Are there any additional elements you would like to include in the chart, such
  as a legend or data source acknowledgment?'
