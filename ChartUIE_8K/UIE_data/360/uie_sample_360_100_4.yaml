initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize employee attrition by
  education level. It should show the relationship between the number of years at
  the company and monthly income for employees. The x-axis should represent the years
  at the company, and the y-axis should show the monthly income. Additionally, use
  different markers or colors to distinguish between employees who have left the company
  (Attrition=Yes) and those who haven't (Attrition=No). It would be helpful if the
  data points also reflected the education field, perhaps with different marker shapes
  or sizes.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing between employees
  who have left the company and those who haven''t?

  2. Do you have any preference for marker shapes or sizes to indicate different education
  fields?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the markers and colors
  used?

  4. Are there specific titles or labels you would like to use for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the overall title of the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  7. Would you prefer a specific scale or range for the x-axis (Years at the company)
  and y-axis (Monthly income)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to add to the scatter
  plot?'
