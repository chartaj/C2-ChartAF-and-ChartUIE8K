initial_prompt: 'I want a box chart that visualizes employee attrition in relation
  to their education levels. Please use the data provided for attributes such as ''Age'',
  ''Attrition'', ''Education'', ''JobLevel'', and ''MonthlyIncome''. The x-axis should
  represent different education levels, and the y-axis should show monthly income,
  with separate boxes for employees who left (''Attrition'': ''Yes'') and those who
  stayed (''Attrition'': ''No''). The chart should help us understand how education
  levels correlate with monthly income and whether there''s a pattern in attrition
  across different education groups. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have any preference for the ordering of education levels on the x-axis

  5. Do you want any specific title or description for the chart?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or markers to highlight specific data points
  or patterns?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text on the chart?

  8. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between employees who left and
  those who stayed?

  9. Should the chart include axis labels and, if yes, what text should be used for
  them?

  box plots?'
