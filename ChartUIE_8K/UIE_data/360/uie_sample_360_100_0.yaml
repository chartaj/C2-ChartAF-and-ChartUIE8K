initial_prompt: Create a network diagram to visualize employee attrition data with
  nodes representing employees and edges showing relationships, such as same job role
  or department. Highlight nodes with specific colors for different attrition statuses
  to emphasize trends. Include text annotations to display notable attributes like
  YearsAtCompany and JobSatisfaction near relevant nodes. The purpose is to identify
  patterns and relationships in employee attrition, focusing on education and tenure.
  This will help to uncover trends and insights into workforce dynamics based on the
  dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for specific colors to represent different
  attrition statuses?

  2. How would you like the nodes to be organized or grouped in the network diagram
  (e.g., by department, job role)?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout style for the network diagram (e.g., circular,
  hierarchical)?

  4. Should the text annotations for YearsAtCompany and JobSatisfaction be always
  visible, or should they appear only on hover?

  5. Do you have any specific font size or style preferences for the text annotations?

  6. Would you like any additional attributes displayed on the nodes other than YearsAtCompany
  and JobSatisfaction?

  7. Is there a maximum number of relationships (edges) you would prefer to display
  to avoid clutter?

  8. Do you have any preference on the size of the nodes (e.g., should it be proportional
  to YearsAtCompany or another metric)?

  9. Should any specific departments or job roles be emphasized or highlighted differently
  in the network diagram?'
