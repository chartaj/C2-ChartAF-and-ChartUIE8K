initial_prompt: I would like a choropleth map to visualize the percentage of individuals
  using the Internet by country over time. Please use the data from 54.csv, focusing
  on the "Individuals using the Internet (% of population)" column. Make sure to highlight
  each country based on the percentage of its population using the Internet for different
  years. The map should have a color gradient where countries with higher Internet
  usage percentages are colored darker. Include a timeline feature to view changes
  across different years. This map will help understand global Internet adoption trends.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the color gradient on the
  choropleth map?

  2. Are there specific years that you want to emphasize or compare in the timeline
  feature?

  3. What range of percentages would you like to see highlighted (e.g., 0% to 100%)?

  4. Would you like country borders to be prominently displayed on the map?

  5. Do you have any preference regarding the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  etc.)?

  6. Should the map include labels for each country?

  7. How detailed should the legend be for explaining the color gradient?

  8. Are there any specific visual cues or annotations you''d like to include for
  certain countries or regions?

  9. Is there a preferred font style or size for text elements such as labels and
  legends?

  10. Would you like to include any additional information or contextual data (e.g.,
  population size, GDP) as part of the visualization?'
