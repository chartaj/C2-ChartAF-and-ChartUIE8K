initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart visualizing the percentage of individuals
  using the Internet from 1990 to 2020. Each column should represent a year, and each
  segment within the column should represent different countries. Please use the provided
  data from the CSV; make sure to display the trends and highlight any missing data.
  Additionally, ensure that the chart is easy to read with proper labels for the X-axis
  (Year), Y-axis (% of Population using the Internet), and a legend for different
  countries. This visual will help show the adoption rate over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different countries
  in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Should we use any particular scale (linear or logarithmic) for the Y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. How would you like the missing data to be highlighted or indicated?

  6. Is there any specific order in which the countries should be presented in the
  legend?

  7. Would you prefer to have data labels on each segment of the columns?

  8. Do you have any preference on the sorting order of the columns (by year or by
  any other attribute)?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or footnotes to explain the trends
  or highlight specific years?
