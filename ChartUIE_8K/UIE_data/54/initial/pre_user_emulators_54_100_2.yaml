2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart to display the percentage of individuals using the Internet by
  year. Use the data for different countries, highlighting Afghanistan. Include text
  annotations for years with notable changes in Internet use. Make the chart visually
  engaging by using colors to distinguish between each country and highlight Afghanistan
  in a distinct color. This visual can illustrate the growth of Internet usage over
  time and highlight key years of change, serving both informative and analytical
  purposes within the context of technology adoption.
