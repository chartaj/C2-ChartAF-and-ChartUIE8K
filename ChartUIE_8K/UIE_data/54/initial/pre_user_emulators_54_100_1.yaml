2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart showing the percentage of individuals using the Internet over
  time for different countries. Highlight significant trends or changes to emphasize
  key points. Include text annotations for notable years such as the first significant
  increase or when the percentage reaches a critical threshold. This will help viewers
  understand how Internet usage has evolved globally and identify milestones or patterns
  in different regions. The chart should aim to provide insight into the growth of
  Internet adoption and its impact on global connectivity, making it useful for educational
  and analytical purposes in the field of technology and Internet studies.
