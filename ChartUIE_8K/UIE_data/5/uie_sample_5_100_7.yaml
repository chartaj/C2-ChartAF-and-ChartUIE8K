initial_prompt: 'Please create a geographic heatmap showcasing the distribution of
  suicide victims'' professional profiles across different states/UTs in India for
  the year 2001. Highlight categories like ''House Wife,'' ''Service (Government),''
  and ''Service (Private).'' Use color gradients to represent the total number of
  male and female victims in each state/UT. Make sure to differentiate between different
  age groups: "upto 14 years," "15-29 years," "30-44 years," "45-59 years," and "60
  years and above." The heatmap should help visualize patterns and identify states
  with higher occurrences of suicides within these professional categories.'
