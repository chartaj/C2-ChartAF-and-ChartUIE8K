initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing the statewise professional profile of suicide
  victims over various years, broken down by gender and age group. I need a parallel
  coordinates chart to visualize this data. The chart should include states, years,
  causes of suicide, and the different male and female age categories to display the
  relationships and trends in suicide rates among various professions and demographics.
  This visualization will help identify any significant patterns or anomalies in the
  data. Please ensure the axes are clearly labeled and differentiate males from females
  effectively for easier analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  male and female data points?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the states, age groups, or causes
  of suicide?

  3. Would you like to include data labels or tooltips for more detailed information
  on hover?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to clearly differentiate between different
  categories such as states, age groups, or causes?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines in the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Should the chart be normalized or scaled in any way for better comparison?

  9. Do you prefer any specific arrangement or order of the axes?

  10. Are there any specific anomalies or patterns you would like to highlight in
  the visualization?'
