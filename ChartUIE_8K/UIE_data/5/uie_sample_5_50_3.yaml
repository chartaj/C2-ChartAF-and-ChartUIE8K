initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart showing the number of suicides based on
  different professional profiles and age groups for each state/UT in India for the
  year 2001. The chart should include separate bars for males and females in each
  age group category.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be represented on the x-axis?

  3. Do you want the professional profiles to be grouped or stacked within the chart?

  4. Should the data be sorted in any specific order, such as alphabetically by state/UT
  or by the number of suicides?

  5. Do you prefer labels on the bars indicating the numbers, or just the axis values?

  6. Is there a specific style or font you would like for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Would you like a legend to differentiate between males and females, and where
  should it be placed?

  8. Do you want gridlines to be displayed for easier reading of the chart values?

  9. Should there be any annotations or special markers for significant data points
  or trends?

  10. Do you have any specific title or subtitle in mind for the chart?'
