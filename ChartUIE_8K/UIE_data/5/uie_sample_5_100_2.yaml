initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating the professional profile of suicide
  victims over different years categorized by gender and age groups. Highlight key
  data points such as total male and female victims for each profession using distinct
  colors and annotations for clarity. The chart should emphasize trends in specific
  causes of suicide among various age demographics for both males and females across
  different states or UTs. The purpose is to understand the societal and age-related
  distribution of suicide victims to aid social science research and policy-making.
  Include annotations to highlight notable increases or decreases.

  5. Should the chart include a legend that categorizes the different causes of suicide
  by profession?

  6. How would you like the key data points to be marked (e.g., symbols, larger points,
  different colors)?

  want to draw attention to?
