initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the statewise professional profile
  of suicide victims in India for the year 2001. The map should show individual states/UTs
  color-coded based on the total number of suicides. Differentiate the data by profession
  categories like "House Wife", "Service (Government)", and "Service (Private)". Use
  varying shades to represent the density of cases in each state. Include an interactive
  legend to filter by professional category and a tooltip feature that displays detailed
  statistics (gender and age distribution) when hovering over a state. Ensure the
  map is easy to interpret and visually impactful.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the choropleth
  map?

  2. Should there be any particular color shades to represent different density levels
  of suicide cases?

  3. What map projection would you prefer for the choropleth map (e.g., Mercator,
  Albers, etc.)?

  4. Do you want state/UT borders to be highlighted in any specific manner (e.g.,
  thicker lines, different colors)?

  5. Would you prefer any particular font style or size for the state/UT labels on
  the map?

  6. Is there a specific layout/style you envision for the tooltips containing detailed
  statistics?

  7. Do you have a preferred default view for the choropleth map (e.g., zoom level,
  centered on a specific region)?

  8. Should the map include additional geographical features like rivers or major
  cities?'
