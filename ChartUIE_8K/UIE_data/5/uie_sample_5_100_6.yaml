initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the professional profile of suicide
  victims statewise. Each bubble should represent a different cause of suicide, with
  the size of the bubble corresponding to the "Grand Total" of suicides for that cause.
  Use the x-axis for "Year" and the y-axis for "Total Male" suicides. The color of
  the bubbles should differentiate between "Total Male" and "Total Female." This will
  help us understand the prevalence of different suicide causes across states and
  gender distribution over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you want to
  use for differentiating between "Total Male" and "Total Female" bubbles?

  2. Would you like to include state names (STATE/UT) in the bubble tooltips or labels
  for better contextual understanding?

  3. Do you prefer the bubbles to be semi-transparent to allow overlapping bubbles
  to be visible?

  4. Is there any specific range or interval for the "Year" axis you would like to
  set?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors representing "Total
  Male" and "Total Female" on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  7. Would you like to display data labels inside the bubbles indicating the "Grand
  Total"?

  8. Do you need any grid lines or background lines to help with the readability of
  the chart?

  9. Is there any specific order you want the causes of suicides (CAUSE) to be displayed
  or just alphabetically sorted?

  10. Do you have any preference for the title of the chart?'
