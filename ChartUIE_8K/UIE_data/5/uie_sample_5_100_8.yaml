initial_prompt: I need a box chart that visualizes the professional profile of suicide
  victims across different states and years. The chart should show the distribution
  of suicides by age groups for both males and females across various professions.
  Highlight outliers and compare data from 2001 to other years to see trends. Use
  data points from different states like Andhra Pradesh as examples. This will help
  understand the age-specific impact of profession-related suicides in a social-science
  context. Also, include the total suicides for each category to show the overall
  distribution.
questions: '1. Which color scheme or palette do you prefer for distinguishing different
  age groups, professions, and genders?

  2. Do you have a preference for the ordering of states in the chart?

  3. Should the chart include individual state labels or should they be grouped by
  regions/geographical zones?

  4. Would you like to see any specific annotations or labels for key outliers and
  trends?

  5. Do you want the total suicides to be displayed as labels on or next to the box
  plots?

  6. Do you have a preference for the timeline format (e.g., year labels, date ranges)
  to highlight the trends over the years?

  7. Should the box chart include grid lines for better readability?

  8. How detailed should the interquartile range and whiskers of the box plot be?

  9. Are there any specific states other than Andhra Pradesh that you believe should
  be highlighted or emphasized?

  10. Do you prefer a specific chart layout or orientation (e.g., horizontal or vertical
  box plots)?'
