initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the popularity ("pop") of the top Spotify
  songs from 2010-2019. Use different colors for each year to highlight trends. Include
  text annotations for the top 3 most popular songs to draw attention to them. This
  will help in understanding which songs were most popular each year and compare their
  popularity levels. Add highlights to uniquely identify genres and emphasize the
  contrast in popularity among different genres like "neo mellow," "detroit hip hop,"
  and "dance pop." This provides a quick overview of popular trends over the decade.
