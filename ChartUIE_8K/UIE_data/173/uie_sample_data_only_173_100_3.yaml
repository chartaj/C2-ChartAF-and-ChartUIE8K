02_initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualization for the given dataset of
  top Spotify songs from 2010-2019. The dataset includes various attributes like title,
  artist, genre, bpm, energy, danceability, and popularity for each song. I'm particularly
  interested in visualizing the relationships between these attributes, especially
  how different genres correlate with features like bpm, energy, danceability, and
  popularity over the years. Each cell in the heatmap should represent the correlation
  between two attributes, with color intensity indicating the strength of the correlation.
  Thank you!
