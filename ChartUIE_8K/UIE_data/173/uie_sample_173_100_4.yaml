initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of song attributes
  from 2010-2019. Plot individual histograms for 'bpm', 'nrgy', 'dnce', 'val', and
  'pop'. Each attribute should have its own histogram with appropriate bins to clearly
  show the frequency distribution. Use 'year' as a filter to see how these attributes
  vary over the decade. Include labels, titles, and a legend for clarity. This will
  help in understanding the popular attributes and trends of top Spotify songs from
  2010-2019 in various musical aspects.
