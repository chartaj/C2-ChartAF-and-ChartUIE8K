initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the popularity ('pop') of
  top Spotify songs from 2010-2019, by artist, genre, and year. Use colors to highlight
  varying popularity levels in different regions. Annotate specific data points like
  "Hey, Soul Sister" by Train and "Love The Way You Lie" by Eminem to draw focus.
  This chart aims to show the geographic distribution and popularity trends in music
  over the decade. Highlight differences in music preferences across regions by modifying
  the color intensity in the heatmap. Include annotations for context and key highlights
  to make the trends easily understandable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting varying popularity
  levels?

  2. Should there be a specific color gradient for different popularity levels? If
  so, what range of colors would you prefer?

  3. Do you have preferred color intensity levels or thresholds to highlight differences
  in music preferences across regions?

  4. How would you like the annotations for specific data points like "Hey, Soul Sister"
  and "Love The Way You Lie" to be formatted? (e.g., font size, color, or any highlight?)

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout and design of the geographic heatmap
  (e.g., map projection, region boundaries)?

  6. Are there any specific geographic regions or countries that should be emphasized
  or given special focus?

  7. How detailed should the geographic granularity be (e.g., countries, states, cities)?

  8. Should there be a legend explaining the color intensities and popularity levels?
  If so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  9. Do you have any preference for the font style and size used in the chart for
  titles, labels, and annotations?

  10. Are there any additional data attributes or metadata that should be included
  or excluded from the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. I am not sure about a specific color gradient for different popularity levels.

  3. I am not sure about the color intensity levels or thresholds.

  4. I prefer the annotations to be clear and noticeable, maybe a slightly larger
  font size and a contrasting color to stand out.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the layout and design of the geographic
  heatmap.

  6. I do not know if any specific geographic regions or countries should be emphasized.

  7. I think countries would be a suitable level of granularity.

  8. Yes, I think a legend explaining the color intensities and popularity levels
  is important. It could be positioned at the bottom or side of the map.

  9. I have no specific preference for font style and size.

  10. I do not know if any additional data attributes or metadata should be included.'
