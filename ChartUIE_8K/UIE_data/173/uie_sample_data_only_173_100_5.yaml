  song popularity ('pop' column) over the years from 2010-2019. Use the provided dataset
  of top Spotify songs for this time period. The x-axis should represent the years
  and the y-axis should represent the average popularity. Each point on the chart
  should indicate the average popularity of songs released in that particular year,
