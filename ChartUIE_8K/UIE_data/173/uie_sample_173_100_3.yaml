initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualization for the given dataset of top
  Spotify songs from 2010-2019. The dataset includes various attributes like title,
  artist, genre, bpm, energy, danceability, and popularity for each song. I'm particularly
  interested in visualizing the relationships between these attributes, especially
  how different genres correlate with features like bpm, energy, danceability, and
  popularity over the years. Each cell in the heatmap should represent the correlation
  between two attributes, with color intensity indicating the strength of the correlation.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How many color gradients would you like for indicating the strength of correlations?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for correlation values within each cell?

  4. Do you want a specific range of correlation values to be highlighted?

  5. Would you prefer the heatmap to show data for each year individually or aggregate
  data across all years?

  6. Are there any specific genres or features you would like to emphasize in the
  heatmap?

  7. Is there a preferred order for displaying the attributes in the heatmap?

  8. Should the heatmap include a legend or a key to explain the color intensity?

  9. Do you want any annotations or additional details for high or low correlation
  areas?'
