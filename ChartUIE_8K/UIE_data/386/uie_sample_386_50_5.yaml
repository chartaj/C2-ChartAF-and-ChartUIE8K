initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the relationship between Max_Speed,
  Mileage, and Power of different car types. I want to compare these parameters across
  different car categories like Sedan and Hatchback. This would help me understand
  which type has better performance and efficiency.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the line chart?

  2. Should the lines for each car type be distinguished by different colors or line
  styles?

  3. Would you like grid lines in the background for easier comparison, and if so,
  what density?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include data point markers, and if so, any specific shape or
  style?

  6. Do you want to include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Would you like to see any specific annotations or data labels on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the axis scales (linear, logarithmic) or specific
  range limits for each axis?

  9. Should the chart include titles for the axes, and if so, do you have specific
  titles in mind?

  10. Would you like to include any particular highlighting or emphasis on specific
  car types or data points?'
