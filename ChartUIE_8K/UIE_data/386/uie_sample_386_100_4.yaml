initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the automobile specifications data
  from the given CSV file. Specifically, I want to see comparisons of the Max_Speed,
  Mileage, Power, and Weight columns among different car types. Ensure each car type
  (Sedan, Hatchback, etc.) is represented on the x-axis, and the y-axis should show
  the values of each specification. Highlight any significant differences among the
  car types in the chart. This will help in understanding the performance variations
  across different types of cars. Please ensure the bar chart is clear and well-labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be grouped or stacked for each car type?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the bars showing exact values?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  5. Do you want a legend included to differentiate between the specifications (Max_Speed,
  Mileage, Power, Weight)?

  6. Should any particular car type be highlighted more prominently?

  7. Are there any specific thresholds or benchmarks you want to display on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s orientation (vertical or horizontal
  bars)?

  9. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the values?

  10. Do you need any annotations or comments on specific data points or sections
  of the chart?'
