initial_prompt: I need a line chart to compare different car metrics from your database.
  The chart should plot Max Speed, Mileage, Power, and Weight for different car types
  like Sedan and Hatchback. Each car type should be a separate series on the chart,
  showing data points for the metrics to visualize how they differ. The x-axis will
  be the metrics (Max Speed, Mileage, Power, Weight), and the y-axis will be their
  values. Ensure the chart has a legend to distinguish between car types. This will
  help me analyze the performance and characteristics of each car type visually.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different car types in the
  legend?

  2. Would you like data points to be marked with symbols on the line chart for better
  visibility?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for axis labels and legend text?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  5. Do you require gridlines for better readability of the chart?

  6. Would you like to include data labels for each point on the lines?

  7. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  9. Do you need tooltips to appear when hovering over data points for additional
  information?

  10. Should the x-axis labels (the metrics) be rotated or formatted in a specific
  way for clarity?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please mark data points with symbols.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure about the y-axis range, but linear scale should be fine.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  6. Yes, include data labels for each point.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, include a title "Car Metrics Comparison" and subtitle "Comparison of Sedan
  and Hatchback Metrics".

  9. I do not need tooltips.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
