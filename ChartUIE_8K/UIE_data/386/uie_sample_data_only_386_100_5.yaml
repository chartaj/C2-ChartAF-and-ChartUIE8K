  database. The chart should plot Max Speed, Mileage, Power, and Weight for different
  car types like Sedan and Hatchback. Each car type should be a separate series on
  the chart, showing data points for the metrics to visualize how they differ. The
  x-axis will be the metrics (Max Speed, Mileage, Power, Weight), and the y-axis will
  be their values. Ensure the chart has a legend to distinguish between car types.
  This will help me analyze the performance and characteristics of each car type visually.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
