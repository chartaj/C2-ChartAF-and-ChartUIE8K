- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a box plot visualization that shows the distribution of Max_Speed, Mileage,
  Power, and Weight for different car Types from a car dataset. Summarize key statistics
  and highlight any outliers. The chart should help identify trends or unusual values
  within these categories. Include text annotations for specific outliers, noting
  their values and significance. Utilize different shades or colors to distinguish
  between car types, emphasizing any remarkable differences between them. This visualization
  will be used to understand the general performance and attributes of various types
  of cars.
