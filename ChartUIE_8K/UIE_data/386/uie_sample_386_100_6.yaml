initial_prompt: Can you please create a histogram for me using the provided car data?
  I'd like to see the distribution of each numeric attribute such as Max_Speed, Mileage,
  Power, and Weight. This way, I can understand how these characteristics vary among
  different types of cars. Additionally, ensure that each histogram is labeled clearly
  with appropriate titles and axis labels. Since the dataset includes various car
  types like Sedan and Hatchback, it would be helpful to distinguish these categories
  if possible. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to distinguish
  between different car types in the histograms?

  2. Would you like to set a specific number of bins for each histogram, or should
  the bins be determined automatically based on the data?

  3. Do you prefer the histograms to be displayed as separate charts for each numeric
  attribute, or would you like them combined in some way (e.g., facets or overlays)?

  4. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would prefer for the titles
  and axis labels?

  5. Should there be any additional annotations or data labels within the histograms?

  6. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the charts?

  7. Would you like to include any specific descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median,
  mode) on the histograms?

  8. Is there a preferred layout or order in which the histograms should be presented?'
