initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for different types of automobiles. Use
  'Max_Speed' on the X-axis and 'Power' on the Y-axis. Include data-driven text annotations
  for some key data points to highlight interesting values. Use different colors for
  each type of car (like Sedan, Hatchback, etc.) to visually distinguish them. The
  purpose of this visualization is to compare the speed and power of various car types
  for potential buyers. Additionally, ensure the plotted points are clear and highlighted
  to stand out. This will help in understanding which car types have better performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between different
  car types?

  2. Would you like to specify which data points should have text annotations, or
  should we highlight the top performers automatically?

  3. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for the text annotations?

  4. Should the data points be displayed with specific shapes or markers to enhance
  clarity?

  5. Do you prefer a grid background or a plain background for the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to specify the different car types, and if so,
  where should it be positioned?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis titles and labels, such as
  font size or style?

  8. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for the X-axis (''Max_Speed'')
  and Y-axis (''Power'')?

  9. Would you like to include any tooltips or hover effects for additional information
  on each data point?'
