initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the average max speed, mileage, power,
  and weight for each car type so we can compare the performance and attributes of
  different automobiles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. Should each car type have different colors for each attribute (max speed, mileage,
  power, weight) displayed, or should they be grouped together by car type?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and axis titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to identify each attribute by color?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you want the average values to be displayed on top of each bar?

  8. Is there a preference for the order of car types on the axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  performance-based)?

  9. Would you like to add any specific titles or annotations to the chart?

  10. Should there be any specific scale for the y-axis (e.g., starting from zero,
  or auto-scaling based on data range)?'
