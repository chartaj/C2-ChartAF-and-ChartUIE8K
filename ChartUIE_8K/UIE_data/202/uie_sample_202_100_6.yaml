initial_prompt: I need a pie chart for the Facial Emotion Recognition dataset focused
  on the gender distribution. The chart should compare the proportion of male and
  female participants in the study. Given the dataset has columns like gender and
  country, visualize the percentage breakdown of genders in a clear and concise manner.
  This will help in understanding the balance of male and female representations in
  the dataset, which is crucial for assessing any potential gender biases in the psychological
  study. Please utilize distinct colors for each gender to make the differences easily
  noticeable.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for representing male and female
  genders in the pie chart?

  2. Would you like data labels showing percentages or actual counts on the pie chart
  slices?

  3. Should there be a legend to denote what each color represents, or should the
  information be embedded within the chart slices?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart title and labels?

  5. Is there any particular title you would like to use for the pie chart?

  6. Should the chart include source or dataset information, such as a data source
  note at the bottom?'
