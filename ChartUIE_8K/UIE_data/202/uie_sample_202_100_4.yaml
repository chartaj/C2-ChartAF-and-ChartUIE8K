initial_prompt: Hi, I'd like a choropleth map created to visualize the distribution
  of different genders across countries using data from the Facial Emotion Recognition
  Dataset. This map should highlight the number of individuals of different genders
  from various countries. Make sure to use the columns 'country' and 'gender' for
  this visualization. It would be helpful if the map uses different colors to represent
  the different genders, making it easy to see where participants are from and their
  gender distribution in each country. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  genders on the map?

  2. Would you prefer a specific color palette (e.g., sequential, divergent) for the
  choropleth map?

  3. Do you want tooltips to display detailed information when hovering over each
  country?

  4. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or focus on?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  6. Should the map include a legend to explain the color coding for different genders?

  7. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want to include on the map?
  For example, should each country be labeled with its name?

  8. Would you like the map to include borders or boundaries for regions within countries?

  9. Do you prefer any specific data classification methods for the choropleth map
  (e.g., equal intervals, quantiles, natural breaks)?

  10. Are there any additional data attributes or metrics you''d like to see on the
  map besides gender distribution?'
