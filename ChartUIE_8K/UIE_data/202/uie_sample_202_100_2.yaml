  Create a column chart visualizing the gender distribution within the Facial Emotion
  Recognition Dataset. Ensure the chart includes annotations highlighting the counts
  of male and female participants. Also, apply visual highlights to differentiate
  gender categories. The chart will help to quickly understand the gender demographics
  of the dataset, which is crucial for understanding the representation and potential
  biases in the data. Add context annotations to explain the importance of this demographic
  distribution in psychological research.
