initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the urban population percentages
  globally. Use the given data from 1960 to 2019 showcasing trends and differences
  between countries. Highlighting countries based on their urban population percentages
  will intuitively show how urbanization has evolved. The heatmap should use various
  color gradients to represent different percentage ranges. Ensure it's easy to compare
  trends over the years and spot significant changes or patterns globally. Include
  a time slider to view changes year by year. Please label countries and provide a
  clear legend. This would help in visualizing the worldwide declining urban population
  figures effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing different urban
  population percentage ranges?

  2. How would you like the countries to be labeled on the heatmap?

  3. Is there a specific style or format you prefer for the legend?

  4. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to emphasize or highlight?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the scale or range of the data values displayed?

  6. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color gradient.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference for the legend format.

  4. I am not sure about specific countries or regions to emphasize.

  5. I do not have any preferences for the scale or range.

  6. I have no specific requirements for additional annotations or notes.'
