initial_prompt: 'I''d like to see a bar chart visualizing the urban population percentage
  trend from 1960 to 2020 for three countries: Aruba, Afghanistan, and Angola. The
  x-axis should show the years, and the y-axis should display the urban population
  percentages. Use different colors to represent each country in the chart. This visualization
  will help us understand how urbanization has changed over time in these countries,
  aligning with our analysis of worldwide declining urban population figures in social
  sciences. Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to read. Thank you!'
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the layout of the bar chart (horizontal\
  \ or vertical bars)?\n2. Would you prefer any specific color scheme for the countries,\
  \ or should default distinct colors be used?\n3. Do you want data labels showing\
  \ the exact urban population percentages on each bar?\n4. Should the chart include\
  \ any specific title or subtitle?\n5. Is there a preference for font styles or sizes\
  \ for the axis labels and title?\n6. Do you need a legend to clearly identify each\
  \ country’s color?\n7. Would you like to include gridlines to help with readability,\
  \ and if so, do you have a preference for their style (e.g., dashed, solid)?\n8.\
  \ Should there be any specific information or annotations included in the chart\
  \ to highlight key years or events? \n9. How would you like to handle any missing\
  \ data points, for example, via interpolation or leaving gaps?\n10. Are there any\
  \ specific sources or logos that need to be included in the visualization for context\
  \ or credibility?"
