initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram visualizing urban population percentages from
  1960 to 2019 for countries (examples: Aruba, Afghanistan, Angola). Highlight significant
  changes over the decades, specifically focusing on periods of rapid urbanization.
  Annotate key years where notable shifts occur. This visualization aims to illustrate
  the trend of increasing urban population globally. Annotations should spotlight
  peak growth years to draw attention. Use color coding to distinguish each country
  for clarity. This chart will help emphasize the trajectory of urbanization over
  time and its varying rates across different regions. Keep the annotations informative
  yet concise.'
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing different countries
  in the histogram?

  2. Do you have a preferred style for the annotations highlighting key years (e.g.,
  arrows, labels, markers)?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you want for the annotations and axis
  labels?

  4. Do you have a desired layout or position for the legend?

  5. Would you prefer a specific type of histogram (e.g., stacked, side-by-side) to
  compare the countries?

  6. Are there any specific colors you do or do not want used in the visualization?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the background for better readability, or should they
  be excluded for a cleaner look?

  8. Should the y-axis be set to start from zero, or should it be auto-fitted to the
  data range?

  9. Are there any specific countries, aside from the examples given, that you definitely
  want included or excluded in the visualization?

  10. Do you have a preferred format for the title or subtitle of the chart to emphasize
  the trend of increasing urban population?'
