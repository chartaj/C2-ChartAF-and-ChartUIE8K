initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the decline in urban population percentages
  worldwide from 1960 to 2019. Use the dataset provided, which includes yearly urban
  population percentages for various countries. The chart should show the distribution
  and variation in urban population percentages for each year. Highlight trends and
  any significant outliers over time. The focus should be on comparing these percentages
