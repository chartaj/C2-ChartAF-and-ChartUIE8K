  <start of data visualization instruction>

  Create a box chart to visualize the decline in urban population percentages worldwide
  from 1960 to 2019. Use the dataset provided, which includes yearly urban population
  percentages for various countries. The chart should show the distribution and variation
  in urban population percentages for each year. Highlight trends and any significant
  outliers over time. The focus should be on comparing these percentages across different
  years to identify patterns of declining urbanization. Ensure the chart is clearly
  labeled with axes representing years and urban population percentages. The title
  should read "Global Urban Population Decline (1960-2019)".
