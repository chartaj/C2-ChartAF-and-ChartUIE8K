initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing total sales across different states
  in the USA from the Superstore Sales dataset. Use color gradients to represent sales
  volumes per state.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients preference for representing
  sales volumes?

  2. Would you like labels on the map to display the exact sales figures for each
  state?

  3. Do you prefer a specific geographic projection for the map (e.g., Mercator, Albers,
  etc.)?

  4. Should we include a legend to explain the color gradient scale? If yes, where
  would you prefer the legend to be placed?

  5. Are there any specific states you would like to highlight or annotate on the
  map?

  6. Would you like to set a specific range or threshold for the color gradient (e.g.,
  minimum and maximum sales values)?

  7. Do you prefer the map to include borders and names of states for better readability?

  8. Would you like to include any additional context or annotations, such as average
  sales per state or total sales?'
