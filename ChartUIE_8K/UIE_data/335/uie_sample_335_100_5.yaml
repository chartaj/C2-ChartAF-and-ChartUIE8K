initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of sales
  across different product categories in the Superstore Sales dataset. Use the "Category"
  column for the labels and the "Sales" column for the values. Make sure each category
  segment shows its percentage share of the total sales. Include labels within each
  segment for easy identification, and use contrasting colors for different categories
  to make the chart visually appealing. Ensure the chart has a title "Sales Distribution
  by Category" and a legend to indicate the colors corresponding to each category.
  Thank you!

  2. Would you prefer the labels to display the category names, percentage values,
  or both?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  4. How detailed do you want the legend to be? Should it include sample colors of
  each segment along with the category names, or is the category name sufficient?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the size of the chart or the aspect ratio?

  6. Should the chart include any tooltips or hover effects when viewed?

  of the chart)?
