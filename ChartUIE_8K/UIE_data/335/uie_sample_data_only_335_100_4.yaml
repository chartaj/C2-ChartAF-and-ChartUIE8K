07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap, keeping in
  mind it must be color-blind friendly?

  2. What specific color-blind friendly palettes do you prefer among common ones like
  Deuteranopia, Protanopia, or Tritanopia?

  3. How would you like the heatmap to handle cells with no data? Should they be shown
  with a specific color or left blank?

  4. Would you like to include value labels within the cells of the heatmap or rely
  solely on the color intensities and legend?

  5. Do you have preferences for the exact range and gradient of the color intensity
  (e.g., low sales being light blue, high sales being dark blue)?

  6. Do you have specific font styles or sizes in mind for the title and labels of
  the heatmap?

  7. Should the states and categories be sorted in a particular order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by total sales, etc.)?

  8. Are there any specific states or categories you want to highlight or draw attention
  to in this heatmap?

  9. Do you prefer any specific dimensions (width x height) for the heatmap visualization
  for better readability and presentation?

  10. Are there particular insights or patterns you are hoping to identify or emphasize
