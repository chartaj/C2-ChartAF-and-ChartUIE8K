initial_prompt: Create a diverging bar chart to visualize Superstore sales data from
  the dataset provided. Use "Profit" as the diverging variable to show both positive
  and negative values. Plot the "Product Category" on the y-axis and "Profit" on the
  x-axis. Split the bars in the chart to reflect different segments such as "Consumer,"
  "Corporate," and "Home Office." This will help in comparing profitability across
  product categories and customer segments. Include a legend to distinguish between
  the segments and make the chart visually engaging. Label the axes and title the
  chart "Superstore Sales and Profit by Product Category and Segment."
