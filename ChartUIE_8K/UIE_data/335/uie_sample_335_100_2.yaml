initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the sales and profit trends over
  time based on the order dates provided. Use text annotations to highlight the highest
  and lowest sales figures within the data points. Emphasize key data points with
  highlights to make them stand out. The chart should help in understanding how sales
  and profits have fluctuated over time, providing insights for business decisions.
  Include segments and regions as well, to see geographic or demographic patterns.
  The goal is to use this visualization for analyzing business sales performance and
  profitability trends.
