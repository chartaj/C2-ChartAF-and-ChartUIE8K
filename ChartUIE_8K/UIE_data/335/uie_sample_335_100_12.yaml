initial_prompt: I want to create a dot plot using the Superstore Sales data. The plot
  should visualize the sales and profit for different states. Each dot represents
  a state, plotted with sales on the x-axis and profit on the y-axis. The size of
  the dot should correspond to the quantity of items sold in each state, and the color
  should differentiate the various ship modes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  differentiate the various ship modes?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each state on the dots, or would you prefer
  a legend?

  3. Do you prefer a particular theme for the chart background (e.g., light, dark,
  gridlines)?

  4. Should the size of the dots be proportional to a specific range or follow a particular
  scale?

  5. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and title formatting (e.g., font
  size, font type)?

  6. Is there any specific ordering you would like for the ship modes in the legend?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or markers for key data points?

  8. Should the axes be set with a fixed range, or should they adjust dynamically
  based on the data?

  9. Would you like to display a trend line or any form of regression analysis on
  the plot?

  10. Do you have preferences for how to handle overlapping dots? For instance, using
  transparency or jittering?'
