initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing sales performance across different states
  in the "Superstore Sales" data. Use "State" as the rows and "Category" as the columns
  in the heatmap. The color intensity should represent the sum of "Sales" for each
  state-category combination. Include a legend to show the corresponding sales values
  for the color intensities. Also, ensure the heatmap is color-blind friendly. Title
  it "Heatmap of Sales Performance by State and Category".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap, keeping in mind
  it must be color-blind friendly?

  2. What specific color-blind friendly palettes do you prefer among common ones like
  Deuteranopia, Protanopia, or Tritanopia?

  3. How would you like the heatmap to handle cells with no data? Should they be shown
  with a specific color or left blank?

  4. Would you like to include value labels within the cells of the heatmap or rely
  solely on the color intensities and legend?

  5. Do you have preferences for the exact range and gradient of the color intensity
  (e.g., low sales being light blue, high sales being dark blue)?

  6. Do you have specific font styles or sizes in mind for the title and labels of
  the heatmap?

  7. Should the states and categories be sorted in a particular order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by total sales, etc.)?

  8. Are there any specific states or categories you want to highlight or draw attention
  to in this heatmap?

  9. Do you prefer any specific dimensions (width x height) for the heatmap visualization
  for better readability and presentation?

  10. Are there particular insights or patterns you are hoping to identify or emphasize
  with this heatmap?'
