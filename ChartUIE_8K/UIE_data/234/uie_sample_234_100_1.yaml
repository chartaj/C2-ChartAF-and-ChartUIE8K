initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the distribution of bank customers
  across different geographies. Highlight countries with the highest number of customers.
  Use text annotations to show the average credit scores and average balances for
  each country. This will help understand the geographic distribution and financial
  status of the customers in different regions for business analysis in the Deep Learning
  A-Z ANN dataset. Ensure highlights distinguish countries with higher customer concentration.
  This visualization aims to uncover geographical trends and focus areas for business
  growth and customer retention strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like to set specific threshold ranges for highlighting countries with
  higher customer concentrations?

  3. Are there any particular regions or countries you want to emphasize more in the
  visualization?

  4. What style and size do you prefer for the text annotations showing average credit
  scores and balances?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the map''s scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Should the map include a legend, and if so, what style do you prefer for it?

  7. Do you want to include additional geographical markers or labels (e.g., country
  names, capitals)?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  9. What map projection do you prefer (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?'
