initial_prompt: I need a circular treemap for visualizing the representation of different
  parties in the German Bundestag. The data includes party abbreviations and the number
  of MdBs (members of the Bundestag) each party has. Specifically, the parties are
  The Left, SPD, and The Greens with their respective MdBs. The chart should clearly
  show the size of each party's representation relative to each other, helping to
  understand the distribution of seats in the government. Make sure itâ€™s easy to distinguish
  each party by using different colors or sections for clarity. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party?

  2. Would you like labels to be displayed within each section of the circular treemap?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to specify which color corresponds to which party?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the parties to be displayed?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels?

  6. Would you like any additional information or annotations to be included in the
  chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the overall size or dimensions of the chart?'
