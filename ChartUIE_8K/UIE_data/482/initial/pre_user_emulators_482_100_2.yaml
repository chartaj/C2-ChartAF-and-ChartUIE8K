2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a small multiples chart that visualizes the German Bundestag's political
  party representation. Each multiple should represent a political party, highlighting
  the number of MdBs (members of parliament). Use text annotations to show specific
  values for each party, especially the ones with significant MdBs, like SPD and The
  Left. Utilize highlights for these annotations to draw attention to major parties.
  The purpose of this visualization is to easily compare the representation across
  different parties within the German government. Please ensure the annotations and
  highlights effectively focus the viewer's attention where needed.
