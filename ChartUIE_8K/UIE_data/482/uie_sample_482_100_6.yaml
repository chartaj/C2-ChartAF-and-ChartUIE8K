initial_prompt: Please create a categorical scatter plot to compare the number of
  members (MdBs) of different political parties in the German Bundestag. Use the abbreviations
  for the parties (Abbr.) on the x-axis and the number of members on the y-axis. Highlight
  the differences between the parties visually, as this will help to easily see which
  parties have more or fewer members. Make sure to label the axes and include a legend
  if necessary. The data comes from a government dataset, so ensure the chart is clean
  and professional. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for highlighting the differences
  between the parties?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  legend?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the points to show the exact number
  of members for each party?

  4. Should gridlines be included or omitted in the scatter plot?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you want to include in the
  chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  7. Would you like any specific styling for the markers representing data points,
  such as shape, size, or border color?

  8. Is there a specific chart title or subtitle you would like to include?

  9. Do you prefer a certain orientation for the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?'
