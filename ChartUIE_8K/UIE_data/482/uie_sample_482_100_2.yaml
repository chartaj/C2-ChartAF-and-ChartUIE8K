initial_prompt: I need a small multiples chart that visualizes the German Bundestag's
  political party representation. Each multiple should represent a political party,
  highlighting the number of MdBs (members of parliament). Use text annotations to
  show specific values for each party, especially the ones with significant MdBs,
  like SPD and The Left. Utilize highlights for these annotations to draw attention
  to major parties. The purpose of this visualization is to easily compare the representation
  across different parties within the German government. Please ensure the annotations
  and highlights effectively focus the viewer's attention where needed.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Are there specific font types or sizes you prefer for text annotations?

  3. Should the multiples be displayed in a particular order (e.g., by number of MdBs,
  alphabetically)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size and orientation of each multiple (e.g.,
  small squares, horizontal or vertical layout)?

  5. Are there any additional highlights or annotations you''d like to see, aside
  from the major parties?

  6. Should there be any legends or titles included in the visualization?

  7. Do you want grid lines or axis labels to be included in each multiple for better
  clarity?

  8. Is there a specific way you want the significant parties like SPD and The Left
  highlighted (e.g., bold colors, outlined boxes, larger text)?'
