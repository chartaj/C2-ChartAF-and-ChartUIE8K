02_initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the Global Video Game Sales dataset.
  Use the Genre column on the x-axis to show the distribution of Global_Sales on the
  y-axis. This will help visualize how sales vary across different game genres globally.
  Make sure to include outliers and show the quartiles within each genre. Additionally,
  please use different colors for each genre for better differentiation and add appropriate
  labels for the axes and the title of the plot. Thank you!
