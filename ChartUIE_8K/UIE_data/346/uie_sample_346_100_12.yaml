initial_prompt: I have a dataset of global video game sales, and I'm interested in
  visualizing the sales trends over time. Can you help me create a line chart showing
  global sales for the top 5 games over the years? I would like the x-axis to represent
  the years and the y-axis to show global sales in millions. The lines should represent
  each of the top 5 games. Additionally, please consider any missing values and handle
  them appropriately, so the chart remains accurate and informative. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  each of the top 5 games?

  2. Would you like any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  game?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Should we add data markers (e.g., dots at each data point) on the lines for emphasis?

  5. Is there a specific way you want to handle the missing values (e.g., interpolation,
  removing)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the chart background (e.g., grid lines, color)?

  7. Would you like to include legends on the chart to identify each game?

  8. Should we add any annotations or trend lines to highlight specific events or
  trends?

  9. Do you want any specific formatting for the y-axis labels (e.g., currency format,
  decimal places)?

  10. Are there any additional notes or information you would like to include on the
  chart?'
