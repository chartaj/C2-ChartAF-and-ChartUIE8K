initial_prompt: Visualize global video game sales using a Choropleth map. Highlight
  top-selling regions with data-driven text annotations showing sales figures. Use
  different shades for NA, EU, JP, and other regions to compare market dominance.
  Emphasize the year with missing values to show long-term trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palettes or shades for representing
  different regions (NA, EU, JP, Other)?

  2. Should the text annotations be displayed in a specific style, such as font size,
  color, or placement?

  3. Would you like the map to show sales figures for a specific year by default,
  or should it dynamically display figures for different years?

  4. How would you prefer missing values to be highlighted on the map? Would a specific
  color or pattern be more effective?

  5. Is there a specific way youâ€™d like to handle overlapping text annotations in
  densely populated regions?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the map''s geographical boundaries or projection
  style (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  7. Would you like additional visual elements, such as legends, titles, or tooltips,
  to be included in the chart?

  8. Should the map include a time slider or another method to navigate through different
  years?

  9. Are there specific regions or countries that you want to emphasize or de-emphasize
  on the map?

  10. Would you prefer to see absolute sales figures or normalized values (e.g., sales
  per capita) for comparison?'
