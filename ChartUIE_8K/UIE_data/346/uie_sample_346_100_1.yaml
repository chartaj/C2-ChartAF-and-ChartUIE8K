initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart for Global Video Game Sales. Use the columns
  'NA_Sales', 'EU_Sales', 'JP_Sales', and 'Other_Sales' stacked to represent 'Global_Sales'
  on the y-axis, and 'Name' on the x-axis. Highlight 'Wii Sports', 'Super Mario Bros.',
  and 'Mario Kart Wii'. Add text annotations for the sales values of these games to
  focus viewer attention on the top performers. This visualization will help identify
  the top-selling games globally and regionally, providing insights into market trends.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different sales regions
  (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales)?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement or style of text annotations
  highlighting the sales values for ''Wii Sports'', ''Super Mario Bros.'', and ''Mario
  Kart Wii''?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend that distinguishes the different
  sales regions, and if so, where should it be placed on the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size used for the axis labels
  and titles?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart, and if so, should they
  be for both axes or only one (x-axis or y-axis)?

  6. Do you want any additional visual cues such as borders or shadows around the
  bars for better clarity?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the games to be displayed on
  the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by Global_Sales value)?

  8. Are there any specific margins or spacing preferences for the bars or between
  the bars?

  9. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers to indicate specific
  sales milestones or thresholds?

  10. Do you have a preferred orientation for the labels on the x-axis (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?'
