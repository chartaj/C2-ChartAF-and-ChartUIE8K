initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the relationship across different regions'
  sales (NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, Other_Sales) of video games. Color intensity
  should represent the sales volume. Use data filtering for significant publishers
  and genres, highlighting notable trends. Optionally, subset data by era (pre-2000
  vs post-2000) to show shifts over time. Ensure data clarity with appropriate axis
  labels and color gradients. Highlight high-selling games to emphasize sales spikes.
  Use descriptive titles and legends to provide context. The heatmap should reveal
  sales concentration differences across regions and over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color gradient used in
  the heatmap?

  2. Are there any particular publishers or genres you would like to focus on?

  3. How would you prefer high-selling games to be highlighted? (e.g., bold outlines,
  different color tones)

  4. Do you have a preference for the time segmentation between pre-2000 and post-2000?

  5. Is there a specific title or description you would like to use for the heatmap
  and its legend?

  6. Would you like to include any particular axis labels or text annotations to enhance
  data clarity?

  7. Are there any specific regions (NA, EU, JP, Other) you would like to emphasize
  more in the heatmap?

  8. Is there a specific threshold for sales volume that you want to set for filtering
  significant data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, I have no specific preference.

  2. I do not know, I have no specific preference.

  3. I would prefer high-selling games to be highlighted with bold outlines.

  4. I am not sure, whatever works best to show trends over time.

  5. No specific title in mind, but something descriptive of video game sales across
  regions would be good.

  6. Yes, clear axis labels for NA_Sales, EU_Sales, JP_Sales, and Other_Sales would
  be appreciated.

  7. I do not know, no specific preference.

  8. I do not have a specific threshold, but focusing on significant sales figures
  that stand out would be great.'
