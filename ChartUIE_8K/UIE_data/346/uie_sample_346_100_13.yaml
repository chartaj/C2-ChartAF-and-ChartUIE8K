initial_prompt: I want to visualize the global video game sales to see the top-selling
  games across different platforms and years. Please create a Bar chart showing the
  top 10 best-selling video games globally. The chart should include the games' names
  on the x-axis and the global sales on the y-axis. Highlight which platforms and
  genres they belong to using different colors or labels. Can you provide insights
  about the publishers and how sales compare between regions like North America, Europe,
  and Japan?
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating platforms
  and genres?

  2. Should the bars be grouped or stacked based on platforms, or would you prefer
  separate colors or labels for each platform?

  3. How would you like the publishers'' information to be displayed? As a label next
  to each bar, or as a separate legend?

  4. How would you like regional sales comparisons to be visualized? Separate bar
  segments within the same bar, adjacent bars, or through a different visualization
  method?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the ordering of the games on the x-axis, besides
  being sorted by global sales?

  6. Would you like any specific annotations or data labels on the bars, such as exact
  sales figures?

  7. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical orientation for the bar chart?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for text elements
  like axis titles, labels, and legends?'
