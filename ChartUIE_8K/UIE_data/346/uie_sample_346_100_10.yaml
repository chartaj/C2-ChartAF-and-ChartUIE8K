initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of Global Sales of
  video games for different genres. Use the data provided on video game sales, focusing
  on how 'Global_Sales' varies among distinct 'Genre' categories. Ensure the chart
  effectively showcases the range, median, and any potential outliers within each
  genre to uncover which genres generally perform better globally. Highlight the 'Sports',
  'Platform', and 'Racing' genres as samples, but include all other available genres
  in the dataset for a comprehensive overview. The visualization should help identify
  trends and variations in sales across game genres.
