initial_prompt: Please create a Bubble chart based on the Global Video Game Sales
  dataset. Plot the 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Global_Sales' on the y-axis. Use 'NA_Sales'
  to determine the size of the bubbles. Different colors should represent different
  'Genres'. The goal is to visualize how video game sales have changed over the years
  across various genres, highlighting the North American market's contribution to
  global sales. Make sure to clearly annotate the top-selling games and include a
  legend for genres. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different genres?

  2. Would you like any specific annotations or notes on particular data points other
  than the top-selling games?

  3. How detailed should the axis labels be? (e.g., should the x-axis label every
  single year or just every decade?)

  4. Do you prefer a specific size range for the bubbles to ensure clarity?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines or background shading to improve readability?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for annotations
  and axis labels?

  7. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the format of the tooltip (e.g., displaying additional
  data on hover)?

  10. Do you prefer the chart to have a specific background color?'
