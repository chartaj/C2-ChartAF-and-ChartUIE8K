initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the dataset from "Parkinson Disease
  Detection". Use patient name and relevant health metrics (like MDVP:Fo(Hz), MDVP:Fhi(Hz),
  etc.) as axes. Highlight areas indicating the presence or intensity of Parkinson’s
  disease. This will help in understanding which health parameters are most indicative
  of the disease. Also, distinguish between different statuses using colors for clear
  differentiation.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting different statuses?

  2. Do you have a specific color gradient preference for indicating the intensity
  of Parkinson’s disease?

  3. What label format would you prefer for the axis titles (e.g., full names, abbreviations)?

  4. Would you like to include a color legend on the heatmap for status differentiation?

  5. Do you have any specific font style or size preference for axis labels and titles?

  6. Are there any particular health metrics you want to prioritize on the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  8. Would you like to annotate specific areas indicating significant correlations
  between health metrics and Parkinson’s disease?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Maybe a gradient from light blue to dark blue.

  3. Full names would be better.

  4. Yes, please include a color legend.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please annotate significant correlations.'
