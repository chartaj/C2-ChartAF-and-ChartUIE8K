initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the dataset of Parkinson Disease
  Detection. Include all the numerical columns like 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'MDVP:Fhi(Hz)',
  'MDVP:Flo(Hz)', 'MDVP:Jitter(%)', 'MDVP:Jitter(Abs)', 'MDVP:RAP', 'MDVP:PPQ', 'Jitter:DDP',
  'MDVP:Shimmer', 'MDVP:Shimmer(dB)', 'Shimmer:APQ3', 'Shimmer:APQ5', 'MDVP:APQ',
  'Shimmer:DDA', 'NHR', 'HNR', 'RPDE', 'DFA', 'spread1', 'spread2', 'D2', and 'PPE'.
  Compare distributions and identify any outliers or variances among the values.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box chart?

  2. Should the outliers be highlighted with a specific color or symbol?

  3. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical layout for the box chart?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better clarity?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding or symbols used?

  6. Do you prefer any specific style for the whiskers (e.g., lines, caps) of the
  box chart?

  7. Should each box plot be labeled with the corresponding data attribute name?

  8. Would you like to have mean or median lines/points shown within the boxes?

  9. Is there a specific order you want the data attributes arranged in the chart?

  10. Would you like the chart to include any specific annotations or callouts for
  significant data points?'
