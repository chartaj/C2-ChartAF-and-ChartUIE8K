initial_prompt: Create a table chart visualizing the dataset to detect Parkinson's
  Disease. Highlight key columns like 'name', 'MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'status', and 'HNR'.
  Utilize text annotations to emphasize significant values in 'MDVP:Jitter(%)' and
  'MDVP:Shimmer(dB)'. This will help focus on important predictors.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the key
  columns?

  2. How would you like significant values in ''MDVP:Jitter(%)'' and ''MDVP:Shimmer(dB)''
  to be annotated?

  3. Are there any specific thresholds for the significant values in ''MDVP:Jitter(%)''
  and ''MDVP:Shimmer(dB)'' that should be highlighted?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like the table chart to include gridlines for easier readability?

  6. Should the key columns be placed in a specific order or arrangement?

  7. Do you need any additional summary statistics or calculations included in the
  chart?

  8. Are there any other columns besides the listed ones that you would like to highlight
  or annotate?

  9. Would you prefer the table chart to be oriented horizontally or vertically?

  10. Should the columns have specific widths or be auto-sized to fit the content?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. For ''MDVP:Jitter(%)'', highlight values above 0.7%, and for ''MDVP:Shimmer(dB)'',
  highlight values above 0.35 dB.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.
