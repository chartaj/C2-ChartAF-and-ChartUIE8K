initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize data trends for Parkinson's disease
  detection. The chart should showcase three sample data points for different individuals
  identified by their 'name'. The x-axis will represent the sample names such as 'phon_R01_S01_1',
  'phon_R01_S01_2', and 'phon_R01_S01_3'. The y-axis will feature key metrics like
  'MDVP:Fo(Hz)', 'MDVP:Fhi(Hz)', 'MDVP:Flo(Hz)', 'HNR', and 'RPDE'. Please ensure
  each metric is represented by a different colored line for clarity. This will help
  in comparing these parameters across the samples for better understanding.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the line chart?

  2. Do you have a preferred style for the legend placement?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart?

  4. Do you have preferences for specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for each
  metric?

  5. Would you like data points to be marked with specific markers (e.g., circles,
  squares) on the lines?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines?

  7. Should the axis labels have specific fonts or sizes for better readability?

  8. Is there any annotation or highlight that you would like to add for specific
  data points?

  9. Would you prefer the y-axis to be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  10. Are there any specific intervals or ranges you''d like to be highlighted on
  the x-axis or y-axis?'
