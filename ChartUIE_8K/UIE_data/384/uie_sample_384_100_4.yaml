  from the provided data. The x-axis should represent the countries and the y-axis
  should indicate the R&D Investment (Billion USD). Additionally, include the R&D
  Investment as a percentage of GDP on a secondary y-axis to show correlation. Ensure
  to highlight the variations and outliers for each country with clear labels. Since
