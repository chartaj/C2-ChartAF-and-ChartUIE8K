initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that shows the R&D Investment by country
  over time. I'd like the x-axis to represent the different countries listed and the
  y-axis to show the amounts of R&D Investment in Billion USD, along with the percentage
  of GDP. Make sure each country has a colored line for its investment amount and
  another differently styled line for the R&D investment as a percentage of GDP. This
  would help in visualizing both the absolute investment and its significance to the
  economy for each country in a clear and comparative way.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used for the different\
  \ countries? \n2. How would you like the lines to be styled to differentiate between\
  \ R&D Investment in Billion USD and R&D Investment as a percentage of GDP (e.g.,\
  \ solid lines for investment amount and dashed lines for percentage of GDP)?\n3.\
  \ Would you like to include data point markers on the lines? If so, what kind of\
  \ markers would you prefer?\n4. Is there a specific order in which you would like\
  \ the countries to be displayed on the x-axis?\n5. Do you want to include a legend\
  \ to help identify the lines for each country and investment type? If so, where\
  \ should it be placed?\n6. Would you like to display gridlines on the chart for\
  \ better readability?\n7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like\
  \ for the chart, x-axis, and y-axis?\n8. Should the y-axis have a dual scale to\
  \ separately display the investment amount and percentage of GDP, or do you have\
  \ another preference?\n9. Would you prefer to have any specific annotations or highlights\
  \ on the chart (e.g., significant data points or trends)?"
