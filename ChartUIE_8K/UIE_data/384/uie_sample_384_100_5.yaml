initial_prompt: I need a treemap visualization of the R&D Investment by country, as
  indicated in the dataset. Each country should be represented as a distinct section
  within the treemap based on its total R&D Investment in Billion USD. Additionally,
  please differentiate sections using colors to represent the R&D Investment as a
  percentage of GDP. This will help me compare both the absolute and relative investments
  between countries. Make sure to include a legend for clarity and ensure the chart
  is easy to interpret at a glance for government policy meetings. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the sections
  in the treemap?

  2. Would you like to include specific labels or annotations for each section within
  the treemap?

  3. How detailed should the legend be? Would you like it to include both investment
  values and percentages?

  4. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or emphasize in
  the visualization?

  5. What font style and size would you prefer for labels and legends to ensure readability
  during policy meetings?

  6. Should the treemap include any additional information, such as total investment
  or average investment, at the top or bottom of the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the layout and spacing of the sections
  within the treemap?

  8. Would you like the chart to include any background grid or lines for easier comparison?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme, please use one that is easy to
  interpret.

  2. I am not sure, but labels for each country within the sections might be useful.

  3. Yes, the legend should include both investment values and percentages.

  4. I do not have any specific countries to highlight.

  5. I do not know, just ensure the font is clear and readable during policy meetings.

  6. I am not sure if additional information is necessary, use your discretion.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences regarding the layout and spacing.
