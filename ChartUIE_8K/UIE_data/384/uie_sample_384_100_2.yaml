initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart visualizing R&D Investment by country.
  The chart should include the amount of investment in billions of USD and the percentage
  of GDP. Highlight the top three countries (United States, China, Japan) and use
  text annotations to display their specific investment values. This will help focus
  on the leading investors. Ensure the chart visually distinguishes these countries
  from others to emphasize their importance. The purpose of this chart is to provide
  a clear comparison of how different countries prioritize R&D investment relative
  to their economic size.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting the top three countries?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences regarding the font style and size for the
  text annotations?

  3. Would you prefer the countries to be displayed in any specific order around the
  radar chart?

  4. Do you have a specific format for displaying the investment values in the text
  annotations (e.g., decimals, currency symbols)?

  5. Are there any additional visual elements you would like to include to enhance
  the chart (e.g., legends, gridlines, labels)?

  6. Would you like to use any specific symbols or shapes to differentiate the top
  three countries from others?

  7. How would you prefer the non-top-three countries to be visually distinguished
  in the radar chart (e.g., different line styles, transparency)?'
