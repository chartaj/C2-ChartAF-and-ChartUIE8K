initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart showing the weight of travel between
  major US cities, categorized by region. Use the 'Type' column to separate nodes
  and edges, with 'regions' and 'weight' on the x-axis and y-axis respectively. Utilize
  unique city names to differentiate each stack within the respective region. If available,
  include the number of passengers in each stack. Ensure missing values are addressed
  appropriately. Label the cities clearly to highlight each contribution. The chart
  should provide a clear visual representation of travel loads between these key regions.
