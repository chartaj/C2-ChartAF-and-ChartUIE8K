initial_prompt: Create a network graph that visualizes air travel between major US
  cities. Use nodes to represent cities, with IDs, names, weights, and regions from
  the data. Edges should represent the connections between these cities, utilizing
  the source, target, and passengers columns. For missing source, target, and passenger
  values, ensure they do not affect the visualization. Make sure the graph clearly
  distinguishes different regions, and the size of the nodes should represent the
  weight. This is for a travel analysis, so interactive features like hover details
  would be awesome.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different regions?

  2. Should the nodes have specific shapes for different regions or any other distinguishing
  features?

  3. How would you like the edges to be styled (e.g., solid, dashed, color-coded by
  passenger volume)?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout for the network graph (e.g., circular, force-directed,
  geographic)?

  5. Should the node size scaling be linear or logarithmic in relation to the weight?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size youâ€™d prefer for node labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. A geographic layout sounds ideal to me.

  5. I think linear scaling for node size in relation to the weight would be good.

  6. I am not sure.'
