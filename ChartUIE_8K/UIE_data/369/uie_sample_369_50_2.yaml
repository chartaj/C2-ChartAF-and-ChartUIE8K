initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize air travel between major US cities.
  Highlight regions and annotate nodes with city names, weights, and passenger counts
  to emphasize travel volume.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific regions or cities you would like to emphasize more than others?

  3. How would you like the annotation of city names, weights, and passenger counts
  to be displayed: inside the nodes, near the nodes, or on hover?

  4. Would you prefer a gradient color scale for the weight and passenger count values,
  or distinct color intervals?

  5. Do you have a preferred labeling format for weights and passenger counts (e.g.,
  exact numbers, thousands, millions)?

  6. Do you require any specific legends or color keys to be included on the heatmap?

  7. Is there a specific layout or orientation you favor for displaying the heatmap
  (e.g., horizontal, vertical, grid-based)?

  8. Are there any specific data thresholds or ranges that you want to be highlighted
  distinctively on the map?'
