initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the air travel data between major US
  cities. Use different colors to highlight the weight of connections between the
  cities. Annotate key points to indicate cities with highest and lowest weights,
  and provide context using non-data-driven annotations about the regions. Use text
  annotations to highlight data points with high or low passenger numbers. The purpose
  is to easily identify and compare the travel intensity and connectivity between
  various regions in the US. Highlights should make the Midwest, East, and West regions
  explicitly stand out.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a specific range of colors to represent different weight magnitudes?

  3. Do you have preferences for the shape or style of annotations on key points?

  4. How detailed should the non-data-driven annotations about the regions be?

  5. Should we include any specific city landmarks or airports in the annotations
  about regions?

  6. Would you prefer any specific labeling style or font for the text annotations
  highlighting data points with high or low passenger numbers?

  7. Do you want any grid lines or borders around the regions to further distinguish
  the Midwest, East, and West?

  8. Are there any specific cities or connections you want to be specially highlighted
  or emphasized?

  9. Do you have a preferred orientation (horizontal/vertical) for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, a specific range would be nice to distinguish the different weights.

  3. I do not know.

  4. They should be detailed enough to give a good context, but not overly detailed.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, grid lines or borders around regions would be helpful.

  8. Please highlight connections to and from New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
