initial_prompt: 'Please create a geographic network graph that visualizes air travel
  between major US cities. The graph should display nodes representing cities like
  New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, etc., and edges indicating travel routes. The weight
  of the nodes should correspond to the city''s significance in the network, and regions
  should be color-coded. Missing values like passengers can be highlighted or interpolated
  if possible. This visualization will help us understand travel intensity and regional
  connections. Ensure the graph is interactive for detailed insights. Data source:
  travel data provided.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the regions?

  2. Would you like the nodes to have specific shapes or styles based on city significance?

  3. How would you like the edges representing travel routes to be styled (e.g., thickness,
  dash pattern)?

  4. Should the weight of the nodes be displayed as labels or tooltips?

  5. How would you prefer to handle the missing values (highlighting vs. interpolation)
  for passengers?

  6. Are there specific cities that should be emphasized or labeled prominently on
  the map?

  7. Do you have preferences for the map''s geographical projection or base map style?

  8. Would you like any additional data layers to be included, such as airports or
  geographic landmarks?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Thickness would be great.

  4. Labels would be preferred.

  5. Highlight the missing values.

  6. New York, Los Angeles, Chicago should be emphasized.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
