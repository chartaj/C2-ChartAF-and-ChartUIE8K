initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the top 3 global organizations by
  workforce size. The x-axis should show the company names, and the y-axis should
  represent the number of employees. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight
  each companyâ€™s share price in USD at the corresponding points. Additionally, use
  different colors to highlight companies from different origins to emphasize geographical
  diversity. This visualization will help understand the distribution of workforce
  sizes across these major global companies and their respective stock prices.

  title?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you would like the companies to appear on
