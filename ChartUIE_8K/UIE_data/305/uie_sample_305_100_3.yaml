initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the share prices (USD) of the global
  organizations ranked by workforce size. Ensure the x-axis represents the company
  origins and the y-axis represents the share prices. Highlight outliers in share
  prices for additional insights. Use different colors for each company origin to
  enhance clarity. Show the median, quartiles, and any potential anomalies in the
  data. Add a legend to distinguish the different origins. This will help in understanding
  the share price distribution across various company origins within the global workforce
  dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different company origins?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. How would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., using different shape
  markers or color highlights)?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend
  text?

  5. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the plotting area?

  6. Would you like the chart to include any specific annotations or text explanations
  for the identified outliers?

  7. Do you have a desired ordering for the company origins on the x-axis (alphabetical,
  by frequency, or custom order)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or limits you would prefer to set on the y-axis?

  9. Would you like to include additional statistical metrics on the chart, such as
  mean or standard deviation?'
