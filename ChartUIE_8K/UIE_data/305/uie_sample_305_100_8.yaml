initial_prompt: I have a dataset with information on global organizations ranked by
  workforce size. Please create a histogram that shows the distribution of the number
  of employees across these companies. Make sure to use appropriate bin sizes to clearly
  show the variations in workforce sizes. Include a title, "Distribution of Workforce
  Sizes Among Global Organizations," and label the x-axis as "Number of Employees"
  and the y-axis as "Frequency." Please ensure that the histogram clearly displays
  the data, considering the range and unique values provided in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred bin size or should I calculate the optimal
  bin size based on the dataset?

  2. What color would you like the bins to be in the histogram?

  3. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the title and axis labels?

  4. Should grid lines be included on the histogram for easier readability?

  5. Do you want any specific data range to be highlighted or focused on within the
  histogram?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or markers on the histogram to emphasize
  certain data points or ranges?

  7. Should the y-axis use a linear scale or a logarithmic scale to better display
  the frequency distribution?

  8. Do you have any preferred layout or dimensions for the histogram (e.g., aspect
  ratio, margins)?'
