initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart visualizing the top 3 global organizations
  ranked by workforce size, showing the number of employees and share price (USD).
  Use the columns Rank, Company, number of employees, and share price (USD). Each
  bar group should represent a company, with individual bars showing the number of
  employees on one axis and the share price on the other. Label the axes appropriately
  and use different colors to distinguish between the two metrics. Title the chart
  "Top 3 Global Organizations by Workforce Size and Share Price."

  of employees'' and ''share price (USD)''?

  2. Should the y-axis scales for ''number of employees'' and ''share price (USD)''
  be different or unified?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and title?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on each bar to show the exact values?

  5. Should the bars be presented in a specific order, such as descending by the number
  of employees or any other criteria?

  6. Do you want to include gridlines to make it easier to read the values from the
  chart?

  7. Is there any specific orientation (vertical or horizontal) you prefer for the
  grouped bar chart?

  8. Would you like to add any annotations or additional information on the chart?
