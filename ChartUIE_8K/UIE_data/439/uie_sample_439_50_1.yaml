initial_prompt: Create a heatmap highlighting the threats faced by extinct plants
  across continents, emphasizing data points linked to endangered species. Utilize
  text annotations to depict unique values and occurrences in each category.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be displayed? (e.g., inside the cells,
  outside the cells, with arrows)

  3. Do you want to include a legend to explain the threat levels?

  4. Would you prefer to use any specific font style or size for the annotations?

  5. Should the heatmap be organized in any particular order? (e.g., by continent,
  by threat levels)

  6. Are there any specific continents or threats you would like to highlight more
  prominently?

  7. What level of granularity do you prefer for the threat levels? (e.g., binary,
  categorical, continuous)

  8. Would you like to include any additional reference lines or markers to emphasize
  specific data points?

  9. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the heatmap? (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical)

  10. Should the extinct plants be grouped by any other attribute such as country
  or group besides continent?'
