initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the trends of the last year the plants
  were seen (year_last_seen) for different binomial names. Use the column 'year_last_seen'
  for the x-axis and the 'binomial_name' for the y-axis. The chart should highlight
  the different continents to provide geographical context. Ensure each data point
  specifies the 'red_list_category' to indicate the conservation status of each plant.
  Color-code the lines based on the group of the plants ('Flowering Plant', etc.).
  This visualization will help understand the timelines of extinction across various
  regions and categories.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart (e.g., landscape, portrait)?

  2. What specific color palette would you like used for the different plant groups?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability? If so, should they
  be on both axes?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Should the data points be shown as markers on the line chart? If so, what shape
  and size do you prefer for the markers?

  6. Do you want legends inside or outside the chart?

  7. Is there a specific order you would like for the binomial names on the y-axis?

  8. Would you like to add any specific annotations or highlights on the chart for
  particular years or events?

  9. How would you like the continents highlighted (e.g., different line styles, background
  shades)?

  10. Is there a need for any additional data labels or tooltips to show extra information
  on hover?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. Yes, please include gridlines on both axes.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please show the data points as markers. I am not sure about the shape and
  size.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific order preferred for the binomial names.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Different line styles would be good for highlighting continents.

  10. No additional data labels or tooltips are needed.'
