initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the threats and actions for different
  plant species across continents. Focus on the threats columns (threat_AA to threat_GE)
  and actions (action_LWP to action_NA). Use color gradients to show the intensity
  of threats and actions. Add text annotations for key species that have high or low
  threat levels and actions taken. Highlight endangered or extinct categories. This
  will help understand the distribution and severity of threats, as well as the effectiveness
  of conservation actions for plants in danger. Title: "Global Plant Threats and Conservation
  Actions."'
questions: '1. What specific color gradients would you prefer to represent the intensity
  of threats and conservation actions?

  2. Do you have preferred color schemes for highlighting endangered or extinct categories?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for key species to be formatted (e.g.,
  font size, color, background)?

  4. Should the heatmap be sorted by any specific criteria (e.g., continent, threat
  level, or action taken)?

  5. Is there a particular way you would like the legend to be displayed or formatted?

  6. Are there any specific labeling preferences for the axes?

  7. Would you prefer any specific title or subtitle formatting for the heatmap?

  8. How would you like the different continents to be visually distinguished in the
  heatmap (e.g., through borders or different shades)?

  9. Should the intensity values be labeled directly on the heatmap cells, or would
  you prefer to have a hover option to see the exact values?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the overall layout and aspect ratio of
  the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color gradients to use.

  2. I do not have any preferred color schemes for highlighting endangered or extinct
  categories.

  3. The text annotations for key species should be in a readable font size and maybe
  in a contrasting color against the heatmap for clarity, but I am not sure about
  the specifics.

  4. I do not know how the heatmap should be sorted.

  5. I am not sure about the legend formatting.

  6. I have no specific labeling preferences for the axes.

  7. A clear and bold title format would be good, but I have no specific preferences
  for the subtitle.

  8. I do not know how the different continents should be visually distinguished in
  the heatmap.

  9. The intensity values should be labeled directly on the heatmap cells.

  10. I do not have any preferences regarding the overall layout and aspect ratio.'
