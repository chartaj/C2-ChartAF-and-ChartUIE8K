initial_prompt: 'Create a scatter plot visualizing the threats faced by plants across
  different continents. X-axis: ''continent'', Y-axis: each threat type (''threat_AA'',
  ''threat_BRU'', etc.). Each point represents a plant species. Color points by ''red_list_category''.
  Title: "Threats to Plants by Continent".'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing the different
  ''red_list_category''?

  2. What size should the points representing plant species be, or should they vary
  based on a specific metric?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be visible on the scatter plot?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  5. Should there be any specific markers or shapes used for the points other than
  simple dots?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed (e.g.,
  top-right, bottom-left)?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or text you would like to add to highlight
  certain data points or clusters?

  8. Do you prefer a specific ordering of continents on the X-axis?'
