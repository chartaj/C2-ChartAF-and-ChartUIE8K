initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the threats faced by endangered
  plants based on the data provided. The x-axis should represent different threat
  categories (threat_AA, threat_BRU, etc.), and the y-axis should show the number
  of plants affected by each threat. Use different colors to distinguish between the
  various continents (Oceania, North America, Africa, etc.) where these plants are
  found. This will help us understand which threats are most common and how they vary
  across different regions. Make sure to include a legend and appropriate labels for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  continents?

  2. Would you like to specify a particular color palette for the bar chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of the legend?

  4. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and titles?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific format for the data labels on the bars?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you would like to include
  in the chart?

  9. Would you like to display the values on top of each bar for better clarity?

  10. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?'
