initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize TED Talk data, focusing on the relationship
  between views and likes across different dates. Highlight popular talks by modifying
  element colors for higher views and likes. Add text annotations to provide values
  for standout talks. The aim is to identify trends, popular topics, and standout
  speakers. Ensure to include proper context to help understand the timeframe and
  speaker diversity. Use the data summary as a guide to determine unique topics, missing
  values, and uniqueness in the dataset. This will aid in educational insights about
  impactful TED Talks.
