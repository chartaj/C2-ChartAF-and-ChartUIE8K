initial_prompt: Please create a histogram depicting the distribution of views for
  TED Talks. The x-axis should represent the number of views in increments of 50,000,
  and the y-axis should display the count of TED Talks within each views range. This
  will help visualize the popularity of various talks in terms of views. Also, include
  a separate histogram for the likes, with the x-axis in increments of 2,000 likes
  and the y-axis showing the count of TED Talks in those ranges. This will aid in
  understanding the engagement level of the talks.

  2. Would you like the histograms to be displayed side by side or in a stacked format?

  3. Are there any specific labels or titles you would prefer for the x-axes and y-axes
  of the histograms?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for titles and labels?

  5. Should the histograms include grid lines for better readability? If so, in what
  style?

  6. Would you like to add any additional annotations or markers to highlight specific
  ranges or values?

  to align with a particular theme or branding?'
