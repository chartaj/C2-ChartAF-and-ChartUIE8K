initial_prompt: I need a box plot showcasing the distribution of views and likes for
  TED Talks over different months and years. Ensure to highlight outliers and median
  values distinctly. The x-axis should represent the months (separated by year) and
  the y-axis should show the number of views and likes. Use different colors for views
  and likes for clear differentiation. Include labels for axes, a title, and a legend.
  This will help to easily compare the engagement metrics (views and likes) over different
  periods for TED Talks.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the views and likes
  to differentiate them more clearly?

  2. Would you prefer a particular style for the outliers, such as specific shapes
  or colors?

  3. Is there a specific format for the title that you prefer (e.g., specific wording
  or structure)?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the labels and
  title?

  5. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?

  6. Are there any additional statistical summaries or annotations (other than median
  values and outliers) that you would like included in the box plot?

  7. Do you have a preference for how the months and years are formatted and displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., "MM YYYY" vs. "Month YYYY")?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the months and years to be
  displayed (chronological or another specific arrangement)?'
