initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of new prices
  for perfumes from the dataset. Use separate bins for different price ranges. Ensure
  the histogram highlights variations among different brands and perfume types (EDT,
  EDP). Include labels for the x-axis (New Price) and y-axis (Frequency). Additionally,
  incorporate distinct color coding for the brands (e.g., PACO RABANNE, Roberto Cavalli,
  S.T.Dupont) to clearly distinguish each one. Also, add a legend to the histogram
  to interpret the colored sections corresponding to each brand.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  2. What color scheme do you prefer for the different brands?

  3. Should the histogram display counts or percentages on the y-axis?

  4. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the histogram?

  5. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels
  and legend?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines in the histogram? If so, do you prefer vertical,
  horizontal, or both types of grid lines?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the legend placement (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific number of bins, but a reasonable number
  to show clear distinctions would be good.

  2. I do not have any specific preference for the color scheme, as long as the different
  brands are clearly distinguishable.

  3. Let''s display counts on the y-axis.

  4. I do not know about the preferred size or aspect ratio, just make sure it''s
  clear and readable.

  5. I have no specific preference for the font styles or sizes.

  6. I am not sure about the grid lines, maybe both vertical and horizontal might
  be useful.

  7. I have no specific preferences for the legend placement.'
