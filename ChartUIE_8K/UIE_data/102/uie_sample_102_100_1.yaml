initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the perfume brands, classifications,
  and price differences. Use the sizes of the rectangles to reflect the old prices,
  and color to show price reduction percentages. Text annotations should highlight
  the top brands and most discounted products. Emphasize the average ratings and scent
  notes. Use seller ratings and number of reviews for additional contextual information.
  This will help users quickly identify the best deals and most popular products.
  The visualization should focus on bringing attention to highly rated, well-priced
  perfumes from reputable sellers within the fashion and beauty category.
