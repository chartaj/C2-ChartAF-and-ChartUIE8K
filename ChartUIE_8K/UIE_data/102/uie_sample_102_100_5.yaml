initial_prompt: I want to create a pie chart showing the distribution of perfumes
  by department (Men, Women, Unisex). This visualization should help to understand
  how perfumes are categorized in the market, focusing on the various departments
  these products belong to. Additionally, the chart should provide a clear picture
  of the concentration types (EDT, EDP) prevalent among these products. Please make
  sure to use the relevant data from the given dataset to ensure accurate representation.
  The final result should visually communicate these insights effectively, making
  it clear and easy to understand for others.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different departments?

  2. Do you have a preference for the label format on the pie chart (e.g., percentage,
  count, or both)?

  3. Would you like the pie chart to include a legend? If so, where should it be positioned?

  4. Should the chart display the concentration types as sub-categories within each
  department segment?

  5. Do you want any specific font style or size for the text on the chart?

  6. Is there a specific chart title you want to use?

  7. Should the slices of the pie chart be sorted in any particular order (e.g., ascending,
  descending, or custom order)?'
