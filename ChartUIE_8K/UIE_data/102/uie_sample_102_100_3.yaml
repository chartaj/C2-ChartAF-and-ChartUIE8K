initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the relationships and intensity between
  different scents and base notes of perfumes. Specifically, I want to see how frequently
  each scent pairs with specific base notes. Include different concentrations (EDT,
  EDP) as an extra layer of information through color gradients. Moreover, ensure
  data points such as item rating and new price are visualized through size or density
  differences within the same heatmap. Keep it focused on the 'noon perfume' dataset
  under 'fashion-and-beauty' category. Aesthetic appeal and clarity are key; it should
  be easy to interpret at a glance. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the concentrations (EDT, EDP) represented within the color
  gradients? Any specific tonal range?

  3. Do you have a preferred method for displaying item rating and new priceâ€”through
  size variations or density differences?

  4. Are there any particular labels or legends that you want to highlight for better
  clarity?

  5. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., horizontal
  vs. vertical alignment of scents and base notes)?

  6. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the text on the heatmap
  to ensure readability?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about the specific tonal range for concentrations (EDT, EDP).

  3. I prefer size variations for displaying item rating and new price.

  4. I do not know; highlight any key labels or legends that will improve clarity.

  5. I do not have a preference for layout or orientation.

  6. I have no specific preference for font style or size.'
