initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the perfumes data. The x-axis
  should represent the perfume brands, and the y-axis should show the average rating
  of the items. Use highlights to distinguish the top three brands with the highest
  ratings. Additionally, provide text annotations for these top-rated brands to show
  their exact average ratings. This visualization should help in identifying which
  brands have the highest customer satisfaction in the "fashion-and-beauty" department
  for the "noon perfume" category. The chart should be easy to read and emphasize
  the differences in item ratings among the brands.

  overall chart?
