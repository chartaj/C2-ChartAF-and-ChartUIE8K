initial_prompt: 'I need a scatter plot for retail sales forecasting. Use the data
  in ''334.csv''. Plot ''data'' on the x-axis to represent the dates. On the y-axis,
  create two sets of points: one for ''venda'' to show sales volume and another for
  ''estoque'' to display stock levels. Use different colors or markers to distinguish
  between sales and stock data points. Add a legend for clarity. Make sure the plot
  shows trends over time and is easy to interpret for business decisions. Please ensure
  all data points are plotted accurately.'

  stock levels data points?

  points?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Should any specific trendlines be added to the scatter plot, such as a moving

  included in the plot?

  9. Would you prefer the data points to be connected by lines to better show trends
  over time?'
