initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize retail sales forecasting. The heatmap
  should display the relationship between sales (`venda`), stock (`estoque`), and
  price (`preco`) over time (`data`). Use text annotations to highlight the highest
  and lowest sales days. Adjust the color scale to emphasize high and low stock levels.
  Include highlights to distinguish different price ranges. Ensure data-driven annotations
  clarify peak periods and low stock warnings. This visualization aims to help business
  stakeholders quickly interpret sales trends and inventory needs over time, aiding
  in strategic business decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palettes for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest sales days to be annotated (e.g., labels,
  icons, specific colors)?

  3. Are there any specific price ranges that you would like to see highlighted?

  4. Do you have preferences for the color scale differentiating high and low stock
  levels?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Are there specific date ranges or time intervals you would prefer the heatmap
  to focus on?

  7. How detailed do you want the text annotations to be for highlighting peak periods
  and low stock warnings?

  8. Would you like separate legends for sales, stock levels, and price ranges, or
  a combined legend?

  9. Is there a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or orientation of the heatmap
  (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical)?'
