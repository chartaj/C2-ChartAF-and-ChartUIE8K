initial_prompt: I want a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of unique values
  in the "venda" column from the retail sales data. The chart should show how the
  sales quantities are spread across different unique values present in the dataset.
  This will help me understand the frequency of each sales number and identify any
  dominant sales volumes. Please use the data from the CSV file provided, ensuring
  that all unique sales values are represented in the pie chart for a clear overview
  of retail sale variations. Include a legend to indicate the sales values corresponding
  to each pie section.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the pie chart sections?

  2. Would you like the pie chart to display the percentage values along with the
  actual sales quantities?

  3. Do you prefer the pie chart to have 3D effects or a flat design?

  4. Should the pie chart sections be exploded or have any separation between them
  for emphasis?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the sales values to be displayed
  (e.g., descending order of frequency)?

  6. Do you want the legend to be positioned at a specific place (e.g., right, bottom,
  left, top) on the chart?

  7. Should there be any labels or annotations on the individual pie sections?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and legend?'
