initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart visualizing Colombo's top-rated spots on TripAdvisor.
  Please distinguish attractions, restaurants, and other spots by using different
  bubble colors or sizes. Show bubble sizes based on the number of reviews and highlight
  higher-rated places. Text annotations for standout reviews or unique features would
  be great. For example, use highlights for highly-rated spots like "The Fishery"
  and annotations for unique places like "Marino Mall." This will help focus attention
  on top-rated and most-reviewed locations. Contextual orientation and editorial comments
  will provide additional insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to distinguish
  between attractions, restaurants, and other spots?

  2. Are there specific bubble size limits that you would prefer to set for the number
  of reviews?

  3. Do you have any font and size preferences for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or heading?

  5. Are there any specific locations or unique features besides "Marino Mall" that
  you would like annotated?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout or positioning for the contextual orientation
  and editorial comments?

  7. Would you like any specific style or format for the highlighted bubbles representing
  highly-rated places?

  8. Should there be a legend to explain the bubble sizes and colors, and if so, where
  should it be positioned?

  9. Do you have any preference for the axis labels or scaling methods?'
