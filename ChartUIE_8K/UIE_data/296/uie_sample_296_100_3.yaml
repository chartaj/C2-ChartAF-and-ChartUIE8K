initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart that illustrates the distribution of different
  categories (like attraction, restaurant) from the Colombo Gems dataset listed on
  TripAdvisor. The chart should show the percentage of places that fall into each
  category type, based on the summary data provided. Include labels for the categories
  and a legend. This will help visualize the proportion of each type of attraction
  or location among the 200 prime spots in Colombo. Please make the chart visually
  appealing and easy to understand. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the pie chart?

  2. Is there a specific font or style you would like for the labels and legend?

  3. How would you like the labels to be displayed (inside the pie slices, outside
  with lines, etc.)?

  4. Do you have a preferred format for displaying the percentages (e.g., with or
  without decimal points)?

  5. Would you like the pie chart to have a 3D effect or remain flat?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the categories listed in the legend?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the chart title or subtitle?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information in the chart such as the
  total number of spots?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the labels to be displayed outside with lines.

  4. Without decimal points, please.

  5. I would like the pie chart to remain flat.

  6. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  7. "Distribution of Top 200 Attractions in Colombo" would be a good title.

  8. Yes, please include the total number of spots (200).
