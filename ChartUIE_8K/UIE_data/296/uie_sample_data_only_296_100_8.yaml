02_initial_prompt: I would like to see a box chart visualizing the price levels across
  different attractions and restaurants in Colombo, as detailed in the dataset. Could
  you create a box chart that shows the distribution of price levels ($, $$ - $$$,
  etc.) for each type of place (ATTRACTION and RESTAURANT)? This would help understand
  how the pricing varies across different categories and rankings. Additionally, could
  you differentiate the boxes for restaurants and attractions by distinct colors to
  easily compare them?
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
