initial_prompt: I would like to see a box chart visualizing the price levels across
  different attractions and restaurants in Colombo, as detailed in the dataset. Could
  you create a box chart that shows the distribution of price levels ($, $$ - $$$,
  etc.) for each type of place (ATTRACTION and RESTAURANT)? This would help understand
  how the pricing varies across different categories and rankings. Additionally, could
  you differentiate the boxes for restaurants and attractions by distinct colors to
  easily compare them?
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating restaurants
  and attractions?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between the different place
  types, or should this be done using labels?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box chart (horizontal or
  vertical)?

  4. Should we include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  5. Would you prefer to display outliers in the box chart?

  6. Do you have a desired style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalistic, colorful,
  professional)?

  7. Should the chart include a background grid for better readability?

  8. Are there any specific places (restaurants or attractions) you would like to
  highlight within the chart?'
