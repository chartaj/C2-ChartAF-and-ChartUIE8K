initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualizing 200 prime spots in Colombo listed on
  TripAdvisor based on various attributes including ranking position, price level,
  category, and rating. Highlight top-rated attractions and restaurants using contrasting
  colors or larger blocks. Annotate key points, such as highest-rated spots and those
  with the most reviews, to draw attention to specific places. Emphasize elements
  with no missing values to ensure data completeness. This will help travelers easily

  on valuable and popular spots for planning a Colombo visit.
