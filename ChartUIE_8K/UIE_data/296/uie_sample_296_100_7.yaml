initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap illustrating the frequency of missing values across
  the columns in the dataset about "Colombo Gems: 200 Prime Spots on TripAdvisor."
  Highlight columns with higher missing values prominently. Ensure the categories
  like ''type'', ''name'', ''rankingPosition'', etc., are visible along the axes.
  Use color gradients to show variations in missing data frequency. Include a legend
  explaining the color scale for easy interpretation. This will help identify areas
  needing more data collection or cleaning. Make sure the chart is easy to understand
  for presentation.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color gradient used in the heatmap
  (e.g., blue to red, green to yellow)?

  2. Should specific columns be emphasized more than others in terms of font size
  or color?

  3. Do you want grid lines to delineate the cells of the heatmap more clearly?

  4. What level of detail do you want in the legend (e.g., more granular or broader
  ranges)?

  5. Do you prefer the axes labels to be rotated for better readability?

  6. Is there a preferred order for the columns to be displayed (e.g., by increasing
  missing values, alphabetical)?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes directly on the heatmap to
  highlight key findings?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text in the chart for better
  readability during the presentation?'
