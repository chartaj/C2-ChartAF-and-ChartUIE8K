  Streams for students in engineering placements. Highlight the key differences in
  CGPA among the streams and focus on those with notable variances. Use text annotations
  to point out the streams with the highest and lowest CGPA medians. Add context by
  annotating the number of internships, hostel status, and history of backlogs for
  each stream with significant CGPA differences. This visualization should help in
