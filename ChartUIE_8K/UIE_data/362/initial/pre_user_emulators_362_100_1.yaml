2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a grouped bar chart to compare the 'PlacedOrNot' status across categories
  like 'Gender', 'Stream', and 'Internships'. Highlight the data points to show which
  groups have a higher placement rate. Include text annotations for significant differences,
  such as streams with highest and lowest placements. This will help in identifying
  trends and making decisions related to engineering placements. Make sure the chart
  is easy to interpret for educational purposes and emphasizes key insights from the
  data.
