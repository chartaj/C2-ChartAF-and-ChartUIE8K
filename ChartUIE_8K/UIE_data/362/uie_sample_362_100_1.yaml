initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the 'PlacedOrNot' status across
  categories like 'Gender', 'Stream', and 'Internships'. Highlight the data points
  to show which groups have a higher placement rate. Include text annotations for
  significant differences, such as streams with highest and lowest placements. This
  will help in identifying trends and making decisions related to engineering placements.
  Make sure the chart is easy to interpret for educational purposes and emphasizes
  key insights from the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different categories?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a specific title or subtitle?

  10. Would you like to include a brief description or narrative alongside the chart
  for context?'
