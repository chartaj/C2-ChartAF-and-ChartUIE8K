initial_prompt: 'Create a radial bar chart to visualize the ''Engineering Placements
  Prediction'' data from the CSV file. Use the following columns as the axes: ''Age'',
  ''Gender'', ''Stream'', ''Internships'', ''CGPA'', ''Hostel'', ''HistoryOfBacklogs'',
  and ''PlacedOrNot''. Ensure each bar represents the unique values for these columns,
  highlighting the distribution and comparison among them. For instance, show the
  number of internships versus CGPA scores, and compare placement rates by gender,
  hostel accommodation, and academic streams. This visualization will help us understand
  key factors influencing placement outcomes in engineering education.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the radial bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to display data in a specific order, such as ascending
  or descending based on a particular attribute?

  3. How detailed would you like the labels and legends to be on the chart?

  4. Should we include axis titles and data point markers for clarity?

  5. Would you like to emphasize any particular data attribute in the visualization,
  such as using highlighting or larger bars?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  8. Should the chart include a title or subtitle? If yes, do you have any specific
  text in mind?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, any order that best represents the data would work.

  3. Detailed labels and legends would be helpful.

  4. Yes, please include axis titles and data point markers for clarity.

  5. No, I do not want to emphasize any particular data attribute.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the font style or size.

  7. I do not know, standard size should be fine.

  8. Yes, please include a title: "Engineering Placements Prediction - Key Factors".
  No subtitle is needed.'
