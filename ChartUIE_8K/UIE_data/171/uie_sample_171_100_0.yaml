initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of 'label' in the
  heartbeat sounds dataset. Highlight the 'artifact' label to emphasize its frequency
  compared to other labels. Use text annotations to show exact counts for each label
  category. This will help in understanding the prevalence of different heartbeat
  sound conditions in the data and ensure focus on anomalies like 'artifact'. Also,
  consider adding context through annotations explaining the significance of highlighted
  categories to aid in medical analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting the ''artifact'' label?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations showing exact
  counts?

  3. Should the bars be ordered in a specific way (e.g., by frequency, alphabetically)?

  4. Do you want the chart title and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  text you would like to be used for them?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or additional context you would like to include
  for the highlighted categories?

  6. Do you prefer the chart background to be a specific color or style (e.g., grid
  lines, no grid lines)?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis ticks and labels (e.g., format,
  orientation)?

  8. Would you like tooltips or hover effects for each bar to show additional information?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, but please make the ''artifact''
  label stand out distinctly.

  2. I do not know the preference for font size and style; just ensure the text is
  clear and readable.

  3. I would prefer the bars to be ordered by frequency.

  4. Yes, include a chart title and axis labels. The chart title can be "Distribution
  of Heartbeat Sound Labels" and the axis labels can be "Labels" for the x-axis and
  "Count" for the y-axis.

  5. Yes, include annotations explaining that ''artifact'' represents noise or irregularities
  and is crucial to identify in the context of medical analysis.

  6. I am not sure about the background; use what you think is best.

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for axis ticks and labels; just make sure
  they are clear and readable.

  8. I have no specific preference regarding tooltips or hover effects.'
