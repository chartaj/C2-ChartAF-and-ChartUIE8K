initial_prompt: I have a dataset about heartbeat sounds classified under several labels
  and sublabels. Please create a stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of
  these labels and sublabels. The bars should represent each unique label, and the
  segments of the bars should represent the respective sublabels within each label.
  Use different colors to distinguish between sublabels. Make sure the visualization
  helps in understanding how prevalent each label and sublabel is within the dataset.
  Additionally, include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to each sublabel.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the sublabels?

  2. Should the bars be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetical order of
  labels, descending prevalence)?

  3. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart text?

  5. Is there a specific layout or size you prefer for the legend?

  6. Would you like percentage values or raw counts displayed on the segments of the
  bars?

  7. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the chart (horizontal or vertical bars)?

  8. Are there any specific labels or sublabels you would like to highlight or emphasize
  in the chart?'

  1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the order. Maybe alphabetical order of labels?

  3. I do not know, maybe just standard titles like "Labels" for the x-axis and "Count"
  for the y-axis?

  4. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  5. I have no specific preference for legend layout or size.

  6. I am not sure. Perhaps raw counts displayed on the segments?

  7. I do not know. Either horizontal or vertical bars should be fine.

  8. No, there are no specific labels or sublabels to highlight.
