initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the heartbeat sounds dataset.
  The chart should use color intensity to represent the density of data points across
  different labels and sublabels. Highlight segments where labels are missing to easily
  identify gaps in data. Use text annotations to call out specific data points, highlighting
  areas with 'artifact' labels for closer inspection. This will help in focusing on
  patterns and variations. The purpose is to provide a clear visual overview of the
  dataset, emphasizing areas that need further analysis or have significant findings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap to represent
  different densities?

  2. How would you like missing labels to be highlighted (e.g., specific color, pattern)?

  3. What level of detail should the text annotations include for specific data points?

  4. Is there a specific size for the text annotations you would prefer?

  5. Should the background of the heatmap be a particular color or gradient?

  6. Are there any specific labels or sublabels other than ''artifact'' that need
  to be highlighted?

  7. What are your preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color intensities?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the font type and size for the text annotations
  and labels?'
