initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the frequency distribution of 'label'
  in the dataset, which outlines heartbeat sounds for health analysis. Highlight the
  data points with missing 'sublabel' values to emphasize areas needing attention.
  Additionally, attach data-driven text annotations depicting the exact count of missing
  'sublabel' values. This visualization aims to identify the prevalence of different
  'label' categories and draw focus to incomplete data points for potential quality
  improvement. Utilize the dataset efficiently to ensure clarity and actionability
  for health data review purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting data points with
  missing ''sublabel'' values and distinguish between different ''label'' categories?

  2. Would you like the histogram to display the frequency counts on the y-axis, or
  would you prefer percentages?

  3. Should the x-axis display the ''label'' categories in alphabetical order, or
  would a custom order be more useful?

  4. What style or format would you prefer for the text annotations showing the count
  of missing ''sublabel'' values?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include for the chart, axes,
  or legend?

  6. Do you have a preference for the bin width or number of bins if applicable for
  the histogram?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart to improve readability?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text within the chart?

  9. Should any additional context or metadata be included in the chart for clarity
  and interpretation?

  10. Do you want any specific margins or padding settings around the chart elements
  for better spacing?'
