initial_prompt: Create a heatmap of heartbeat sound data, highlighting artifacts in
  red. Annotate the severity of artifacts and other health data points. Ensure the
  labels are clear for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap besides highlighting
  artifacts in red?

  2. Do you have a preference for the background color of the heatmap?

  3. How would you like the severity of artifacts to be annotated (e.g., numerical
  values, color gradients)?

  4. Do you have a specific size or aspect ratio in mind for the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific health data points you want to be annotated on the heatmap?

  6. What font style and size do you prefer for the labels to ensure clear interpretation?

  7. How detailed should the annotation be for each health data point?

  8. Should the heatmap include a legend or key to explain the colors and annotations
  used?

  9. Do you want grid lines to be shown on the heatmap for better clarity and separation
  of data points?

  10. Would you prefer any specific borders or margins around the heatmap?'
