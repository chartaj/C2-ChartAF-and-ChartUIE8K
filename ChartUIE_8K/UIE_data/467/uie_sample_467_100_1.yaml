initial_prompt: Create a population pyramid for Germany showing age spans with male
  and female populations. Highlight older age spans (e.g., 85 and above) and add text
  annotations for significant values. Emphasize the visual distinction between male
  and female data to understand the demographic spread. This will help analyze the
  aging population, informing government policies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between male
  and female populations?

  2. What color should be used to highlight the older age spans (e.g., 85 and above)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for text annotations for
  significant values?

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the color scheme?

  5. Is there a specific range of ages or a particular age span you want to focus
  more on?

  6. Do you prefer bar labels or percentage labels for the population quantities?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the pyramid (horizontal vs. vertical)?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines for easier interpretation of values?

  9. Do you want any additional annotations or labels, such as total population counts
  or percentage of total, included in the visualization?

  10. Will the visualization be predominantly used for presentations or printed reports?'
