initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the ARM Stock Data. The x-axis should
  represent dates, and the y-axis should represent closing prices. Use text annotations
  to highlight key dates with the highest and lowest closing prices to draw attention
  to significant points. Modify the appearance of these highlighted points with different
  colors to emphasize their importance. This visualization aims to examine the stock's
  performance over time and identify critical fluctuations in its closing prices.
  Ensure the visualization is easy to interpret and provides insights into the stock's
  trend.
