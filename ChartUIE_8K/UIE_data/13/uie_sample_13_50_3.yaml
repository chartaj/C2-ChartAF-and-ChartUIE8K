initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the ARM stock data over time.
  The x-axis should represent the 'Date', the y-axis should plot the 'Close' values.
  Use distinct colors for different dates.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line or points on
  the chart?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for the line
  representing ''Close'' values?

  to be continuous without markers?

  key dates or ''Close'' values?

  type, etc.)?

  7. Would you like to see a legend on the chart, even though there is only one data
  series (''Close'' values)?

  8. Should the x-axis be formatted in a particular way (e.g., display every date,
  show major ticks at monthly intervals)?

  9. Do you want to include any reference lines (e.g., average ''Close'' value) on
  the chart?

  10. Are there any specific date ranges you want to focus on within the chart?'
