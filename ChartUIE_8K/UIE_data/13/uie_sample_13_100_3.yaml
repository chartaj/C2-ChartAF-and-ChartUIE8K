initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the ARM Stock Data over time.
  I want the x-axis to show the 'Date' and the y-axis to display the stock prices.
  Include lines for 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', and 'Adj Close' prices. Make sure
  each price type has a distinct color. This will help me identify trends and fluctuations
  in the stock's performance. Also, indicate the trading 'Volume' on the secondary
  y-axis to understand the trading activity. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to
  read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', ''Close'', and ''Adj Close'' prices?

  2. What style of lines do you prefer (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for the stock
  prices?

  3. Do you have a preferred color for the ''Volume'' line on the secondary y-axis?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the font and size of the labels on the
  x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Would you like to include any markers (e.g., dots, squares) on the lines to highlight
  data points?

  6. Is there a particular format you prefer for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ''YYYY-MM-DD'', ''MM/DD/YYYY'')?

  7. Do you want to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where would you prefer
  it to be located (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  8. Would you like to add gridlines to the chart for better readability, and if so,
  should they be on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  9. Are there any specific time ranges or date intervals you would like to emphasize
  or highlight on the chart?

  10. Do you want annotations for any notable events or turning points in the stock
  data? If yes, please specify the events.'
