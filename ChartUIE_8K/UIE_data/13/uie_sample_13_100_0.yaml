initial_prompt: Please create a histogram chart to visualize the ARM stock data, highlighting
  specific data points to draw attention and include annotations that describe the
  values for those highlighted points. This chart should help us analyze the stock
  performance over time. The y-axis should represent the Closing Price while the x-axis
  should show the dates. Moreover, ensure that the volume is also visible, showing
  how the trading volume changes. This visualization will be useful for business analysis
  and understanding stock trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram and volume bars?

  2. How would you like the specific data points to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, shape)?

  3. Where would you like the annotations for the highlighted points to be placed
  (e.g., above, below)?

  4. Should the volume be displayed as a secondary y-axis or integrated into the primary
  plot?

  5. Do you want any gridlines to be visible on the chart?

  6. What level of date granularity do you prefer on the x-axis (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  7. Do you have a specific font style and size preference for the axis labels and
  annotations?

  8. Should the chart title and axes labels include specific text or formatting?

  9. Are there any specific date ranges or data points that you definitely want to
  ensure are highlighted?'
