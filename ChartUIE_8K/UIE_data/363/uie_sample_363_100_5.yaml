initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various factors
  from the US Police Shootings dataset. Specifically, I want to see how age, gender,
  race, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, manner_of_death, and armed status correlate.
  The dataset columns should be used as axes to display how frequently these combinations
  occur. The heatmap should highlight areas with higher frequencies in darker colors.
  This will help identify patterns and relationships between these factors in the
  context of police shootings across the US. Please make the chart easy to read and
  interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include any specific labels or annotations for clarity?

  3. How detailed should the axis labels be (e.g., should they display every possible
  value or categories instead)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color intensity?

  5. Are there any specific visual styles or themes you prefer for the chart (e.g.,
  minimalist, bold, business-like)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the grid lines or borders within the heatmap?

  7. Should there be any additional text or notes included in the chart to provide
  context?'
