initial_prompt: I want a bar chart for the US Police Shootings dataset. Please visualize
  the number of incidents by state. Use the 'state' column for the x-axis and the
  count of 'id' for the y-axis. Ensure each bar represents a different state. It should
  help in understanding the distribution of police shootings across different states.
  Additionally, make sure to label the axes clearly and include a title that mentions
  the dataset and the visualization's purpose. Can you also use different colors for
  the bars to make it visually appealing?
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color palette used in the
  chart?

  2. What font styles or sizes would you like for the axis labels and title?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, any preference on the style or color?

  4. Is there a specific format you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  5. Would you like to include a legend in the chart to indicate what the different
  bar colors represent?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  7. Should the states on the x-axis be sorted in alphabetical order or by the number
  of incidents?

  8. Do you want to display the exact count of incidents on top of each bar?

  9. Is there a specific layout or size for the chart that you prefer?'
