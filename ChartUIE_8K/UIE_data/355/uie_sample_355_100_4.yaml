initial_prompt: Create a bar chart using the Iris Flower Dataset. The chart should
  display the average values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal
  width, grouped by the species. This will help compare the typical measurements for
  each species of iris. Each bar group should represent one of the species (Iris-setosa,
  etc.), with different-colored bars for each measurement type within that group.
  Make sure to clearly label the axes and provide a legend for the measurements.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different measurement
  types?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed side by side or stacked within each species
  group?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and legend?

  4. Should we include gridlines for better readability of the bar chart? If yes,
  do you have a preference for their appearance?

  5. Would you like to add title and subtitle to the chart? If so, please provide
  the text for each.

  6. Do you want the axis labels to be horizontal or rotated for better readability?

  7. Is there any specific order in which you would like the species to be displayed?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the width of the bars?

  9. Should any specific measurement type be highlighted or emphasized in the chart?

  10. Are there any specific aspects or themes you want to avoid in the chart design?'
