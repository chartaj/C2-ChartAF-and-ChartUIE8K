initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize key statistics of the Iris Flower
  Dataset, focusing on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for
  different species. Use text annotations to highlight the median values of these
  attributes for each species to draw attention to central tendencies. Apply highlights
  to indicate the range of values and outliers that differ significantly from the
  majority of the data. This visualization aims to provide insights into the distribution
  and variability of the measurements in a biological context, aiding in the understanding
  of species differences.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used in
  the box chart?

  2. Should the species be differentiated using specific colors or patterns?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations highlighting
  median values?

  4. Do you prefer a specific type of highlight for indicating the range of values
  and outliers (e.g., different color, bold outlines)?

  5. Do you require additional information on the chart, such as legend position or
  title placement?

  6. Are there any other statistical measures you would like to see annotated besides
  the median (e.g., quartiles, mean)?

  7. Do you prefer the box plots to be vertical or horizontal?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the box chart for
  better readability?

  9. Is there a particular layout or arrangement you prefer for displaying the different
  attributes (e.g., all in one chart or separate charts for each attribute)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please differentiate species using specific colors.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Different color for indicating the range of values and outliers would be good.

  5. Yes, please include a legend and place it at the bottom. The title should be
  at the top center.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Vertical box plots would be preferred.

  8. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  9. All in one chart for a comprehensive comparison.'
