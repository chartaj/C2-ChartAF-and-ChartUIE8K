initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of sepal and petal
  dimensions for the three species in the Iris dataset. Highlight the median values
  and annotate the extremes.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different species in the box
  chart?

  2. Should there be separate box charts for each dimension (sepal and petal) or combined
  in one chart?

  3. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical box plots?

  4. Are there any specific annotation styles you prefer for the extremes?

  5. Do you want grid lines or background shading to be included in the chart?

  6. What font style and size do you prefer for the median value annotations?

  7. Would you like to include any titles or labels for the chart and axes? If so,
  what should they be?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the box plot whisker method (e.g., Tukey,
  percentile)?

  9. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between species?

  10. Are there any specific details or additional information you would like to be
  included in the tooltip or hover text?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer separate box charts for each dimension.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include titles and labels. The chart title should be "Distribution
  of Sepal and Petal Dimensions Across Iris Species" and the axes should be labeled
  with "Dimension (cm)" and "Species".

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between species.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
