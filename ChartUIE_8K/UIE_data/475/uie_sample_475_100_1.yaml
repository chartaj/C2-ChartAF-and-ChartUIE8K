initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize immigration patterns from different
  regions and countries to the United States. Use data columns like 'Region and country
  of last residence 1', 'Austria-Hungary', 'Germany', 'Ireland', etc., and showcase
  the migration numbers. Highlight notable patterns like high immigration from specific
  countries in certain years. Annotate significant data points where there's a considerable
  spike or drop in immigration, such as highest immigration from Germany and Ireland.
  The heatmap should help understand migration trends over time, aiding policymakers
  and researchers in identifying significant shifts or patterns in immigration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to use a specific color gradient to indicate varying levels of
  immigration?

  3. How would you prefer the years to be displayed on the heatmap (e.g., along the
  x-axis)?

  4. How would you prefer the country/region names to be displayed on the heatmap
  (e.g., along the y-axis)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for annotations and labels?

  6. Should notable patterns be highlighted with specific colors or shapes?

  7. How would you like significant spikes or drops in immigration to be annotated
  (e.g., text labels, arrows)?

  8. Do you want a legend to explain the color gradient and its corresponding values
  on the heatmap?

  9. Are there specific years or countries you want to focus on more prominently?

  10. Would you prefer gridlines to be displayed on the heatmap for better readability?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, along the x-axis would be good.

  4. Along the y-axis.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Text labels would be fine.

  8. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  9. Germany and Ireland.

  10. Yes, that would help with readability.
