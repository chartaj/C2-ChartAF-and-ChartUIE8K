initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the given data. The x-axis should
  represent the 'Region and country of last residence 1' column, and the y-axis should
  show the number of people from each region over the years. Each line should represent
  a different country or region, like 'Germany,' 'Ireland,' 'Italy,' 'Russia,' etc.
  Include all regions and ensure the legend clearly indicates each country or region
  represented in the chart. This will help visualize the migration trends over the
  timeline provided in the data. Use different colors for each line for better distinction.
