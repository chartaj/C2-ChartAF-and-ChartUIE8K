initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart comparing CO2 Emissions and Forest Area
  for the countries in the dataset. This visualization will help understand the environmental
  impact and forest coverage across different nations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the radar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display data labels on the vertices of the radar
  chart?

  3. Do you prefer certain line styles (solid, dashed) or markers for the data points?

  4. Should the countries be grouped or color-coded in a specific way?

  5. Would you like any reference lines or threshold indicators in the radar chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scaling of the axes (e.g., logarithmic, linear)?

  7. Should the chart include legend placement in a specific position?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to include a title and axis titles, and if so, what should they
