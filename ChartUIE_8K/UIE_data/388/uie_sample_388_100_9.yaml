initial_prompt: I need a treemap visualization to show the relationship between CO2
  emissions and forest area across different countries. The data has columns for Country,
  CO2 Emissions, and Forest Area, with no missing values, and includes samples like
  the United States, China, and India. Label each segment with the country name and
  display CO2 emissions by color intensity and forest area by the size of each segment.
  This helps understand which countries have the most forest area and emissions correlation.
  Make it visually appealing and easy to interpret. Data is from CO2 Emissions and
  Forest Area by Country study.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for representing CO2
  emissions?

  2. Do you prefer any specific font or text style for labeling the country names?

  3. Should the color intensity scale be linear, logarithmic, or another type?

  4. Is there a specific size range you''d like to use for representing forest area
  segments?

  5. Do you have preferences regarding the aspect ratio or overall dimensions of the
  treemap?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or tooltip for additional information on each
  segment?

  7. Should the labels for each segment (country names) appear inside the segments
  or outside them?

  8. Are there any particular countries you want to highlight or differentiate in
  the treemap?

  9. Do you have any preference for the order or hierarchy of the segments (e.g.,
  by region, alphabetical order)?

  10. Should the chart include any supplementary information such as footnotes or
  data sources?'
