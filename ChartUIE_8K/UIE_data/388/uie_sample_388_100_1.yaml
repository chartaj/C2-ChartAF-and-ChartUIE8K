initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing CO2 Emissions and Forest Area by Country
  from the data provided. Focus on highlighting emissions with different colors and
  add text annotations for the three countries with the highest CO2 emissions. This
  will help emphasize the contrast between CO2 emissions and forest area. The goal
  is to provide a clear visual representation to easily analyze the environmental
  impact of each country. This is particularly useful for raising awareness and aiding
  in environmental science discussions and policies.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for highlighting CO2 emissions?

  2. Is there a specific style or font you would like for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the bars representing CO2 emissions and Forest Area to be
  positioned? (e.g., side-by-side, stacked)

  4. Do you want to include gridlines or axis titles in the chart?

  5. Is there a particular order you would like the countries to be displayed in?
  (e.g., alphabetical, by value of CO2 emissions)

  6. Would you prefer a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Are there any additional labels or legends you want to include in the chart?

  8. Should the chart have any specific size or aspect ratio?

  9. Is there any particular formatting you would like for the numerical values (e.g.,
  commas, decimals)?'
