initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing CO2 emissions and forest area by country.
  Each section represents a country, with subdivisions displaying CO2 emissions and
  forest area. This helps in comparing environmental impact and resource distribution
  among countries.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for differentiating between
  CO2 emissions and forest area?

  2. Should the subdivisions within each country section be proportional to the values
  of CO2 emissions and forest area?

  3. Do you prefer to display the data in any particular order, such as descending
  order by CO2 emissions or forest area?

  4. Would you like to include any labels or annotations within the treemap for clarity?

  5. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or focus on within
  the visualization?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text within the treemap?

  7. Should the legend include both absolute values and percentage contributions of
  CO2 emissions and forest area?

  8. Would you like to see any tooltips or hover information for additional details
  when a user hovers over a section?'
