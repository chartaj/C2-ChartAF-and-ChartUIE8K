  Create a bar chart visualizing CO2 Emissions and Forest Area by Country. Use text
  annotations to highlight the top emitters. Highlight countries with the largest
  forest areas to emphasize their environmental status.

questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Should we use different colors to differentiate between CO2 emissions and forest
  area bars?

  4. Do you want specific labels or legend for the bars representing CO2 emissions
  and forest areas?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to be displayed in a specific order (e.g., ascending/descending)?

  6. Are there any specific countries you want to ensure are particularly highlighted
  in the chart?

  7. Do you have preferences on the axis labels and their appearance (e.g., font style,
  size)?
