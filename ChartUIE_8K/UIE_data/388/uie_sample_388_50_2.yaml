initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the CO2 Emissions and Forest Area
  by Country. Add text annotations on highest and lowest CO2 emissions. Highlight
  countries with emissions above 4000 units.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting countries
  with CO2 emissions above 4000 units?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations to appear for the highest and lowest
  CO2 emissions (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Do you want the CO2 Emissions and Forest Area to be represented on separate axes
  or a single combined axis?

  4. Are there any specific labels, titles, or legends you would like to add to the
  chart?

  5. Would you like a background grid or any specific styling for the chart to enhance
  readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the countries on the x-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, sorted by CO2 emissions, custom order)?

  7. How detailed should the axis labels and intervals be (e.g., interval values,
  precision)?

  8. Do you want specific ranges to be highlighted or marked on the CO2 emissions
  or forest area axes?'
