initial_prompt: 'I need a dot plot to visualize the relationship between CO2 emissions
  and forest area for different countries. The data has three main columns: ''Country'',
  ''CO2Emissions'', and ''ForestArea''. Each dot should represent a country, plotted
  with CO2 emissions on the x-axis and forest area on the y-axis. Both axes must have
  appropriate scales, with country names labeled accordingly. Use different colors
  to represent different countries if possible. This will help in understanding how
  forest areas might correlate with emissions. Make sure the plot is clear and easy
  to interpret.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  countries?

  2. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the country name labels?

  3. Should the scales on the axes be linear or logarithmic?

  4. Do you want gridlines on the plot for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific font types or sizes you would prefer for the labels and
  titles?

  6. Do you want markers to be of a specific shape or size for each country dot?

  7. Should there be a legend indicating which color represents which country?

  8. Would you like any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you want to include reference lines, such as averages or medians, for CO2
  emissions and forest area?

  10. Should there be annotations or tooltips for additional information on hover
  over each dot?'
