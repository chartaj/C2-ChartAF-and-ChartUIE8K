initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the CO2 Emissions against Forest
  Area for different countries using the data in the provided format. The size of
  the bubbles should represent the CO2 Emissions, and each bubble should be labeled
  with its respective country. Given that this data relates to environmental science,
  ensure the chart clearly differentiates the countries to highlight the comparison
  between their CO2 Emissions and Forest Area. Use appropriate scales for the axes
  to accurately represent the range of values in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles to differentiate
  the countries?

  2. Should the chart include a legend explaining the bubble sizes and what they represent?

  3. Do you want any specific font styles or sizes for the country labels on the bubbles?

  4. Would you like to use a specific range for the axes, or should they be automatically
  scaled based on the data?

  5. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or annotate in the chart?

  6. Do you have any preferred layout or aspect ratio for the chart?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Do you want the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  text suggestions for them?

  9. Are there any specific tools or styles you prefer for handling overlapping bubbles
  to ensure all labels are visible?'

  1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining the bubble sizes and what they
  represent.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The axes should be automatically scaled based on the data.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the chart should include grid lines for better readability.

  8. Yes, the chart should have a title and axis labels. The title could be "CO2 Emissions
  vs. Forest Area by Country". The axis labels could be "Forest Area (sq km)" for
  the x-axis and "CO2 Emissions (metric tons)" for the y-axis.

  9. I have no specific preference.
