initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the car data for the Car
  Price Prediction Challenge. Plot the "Engine volume" on the x-axis and "Price" on
  the y-axis. Color code the points based on the "Manufacturer" to show different
  car brands. Additionally, use the size of the points to represent the "Mileage"
  to illustrate how usage affects car prices. This should help in understanding how
  engine size and mileage impact car pricing across different manufacturers. Please
  label the axes and include a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. What color palette would you prefer for differentiating the manufacturers?

  3. Is there a particular size scale you would prefer for representing ''Mileage''?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Should data points have any specific shape besides circular?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style for the legend (e.g., positioned on the right,
  bottom)?

  7. Would you like to include any additional annotations or notes on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?'
