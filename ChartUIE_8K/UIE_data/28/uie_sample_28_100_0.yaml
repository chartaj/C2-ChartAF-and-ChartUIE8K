initial_prompt: I need a bar chart for the Car Price Prediction Challenge, visualizing
  the average prices of cars from different manufacturers. Highlight manufacturers
  with the highest and lowest average prices. Add text annotations to show specific
  average price values for Toyota, BMW, and Honda. Use different colors for different
  manufacturers to make distinctions clear. This chart will help us understand which
  manufacturers tend to have higher or lower priced cars, aiding in our analysis of
  car values for better predictions. Highlighting and annotations ensure key details
  are instantly recognizable. Make sure the chart is clear and informative.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to differentiate\
  \ manufacturers?\n2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used\
  \ for different manufacturers?\n3. Do you have any specific font preferences for\
  \ the text annotations?\n4. How would you like the axes labeled, including any specific\
  \ titles?\n5. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bar charts?\n6. Are there any\
  \ specific styling preferences for the highlighted bars (highest and lowest average\
  \ prices)?\n7. Do you have preferences for the width of the bars?\n8. Do you want\
  \ grid lines to be included for better readability? \n9. Any specific way you would\
  \ like the data sorted (e.g., ascending/descending by average price)?\n10. Should\
  \ the chart include any notes or footnotes to provide additional context?"
