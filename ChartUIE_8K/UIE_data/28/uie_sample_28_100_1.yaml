initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the Car Price Prediction Challenge
  dataset. Focus on visualizing the trend of car prices over the production years.
  Use different colors to represent various manufacturers and highlight key data points
  such as the highest and lowest prices. Annotate these highlighted points to display
  specific values. This will help in understanding how prices have changed over time
  and which manufacturers might be providing the most affordable options. Ensure the
  x-axis represents the production years and the y-axis represents the price. Include
  relevant tooltips for detailed insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different manufacturers?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a specific format for annotations (e.g., font size, style)?

  4. Is there a preference for the chart title or specific axis titles?
