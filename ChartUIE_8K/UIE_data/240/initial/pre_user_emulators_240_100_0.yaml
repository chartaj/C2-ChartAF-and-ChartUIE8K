2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize the trend of tuition fees over different program durations for German
  university courses. Use a line chart with "Duration of Programme" on the x-axis
  and "Tuition Fees" on the y-axis. Annotate key data points where tuition fees are
  either significantly low or high to highlight trends. This visualization helps prospective
  students compare costs effectively. Highlight specific courses starting at different
  times to understand how the beginning of enrolment affects tuition fees. Make the
  city names distinct by color for additional context. Use 30 data points for clarity.
