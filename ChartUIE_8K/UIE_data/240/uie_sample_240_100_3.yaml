initial_prompt: 'Create a geographic heatmap of German university courses from the
  "German Univ. Courses: Comprehensive Catalog" dataset. The heatmap should visualize
  the total number of courses available in each city. Use the ''City Name'' column
  to determine the locations and the ''Course ID'' to count the number of courses
  in each city. Different color intensities should represent the varying numbers of
  courses offered across different cities. Make sure the map is easy to interpret
  and highlights regions with the highest concentration of courses. This visualization
  will help understand the distribution of educational opportunities geographically
  across Germany.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific labels or tooltips to show the exact number of courses
  for each city?

  3. Is there a particular map style you prefer (e.g., terrain, satellite, or default)?

  4. Should the map include country borders and major city markers for better context?

  5. Do you have a preference for the intensity gradation method (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color intensity scale?

  7. Are there any cities or regions you want to be highlighted or annotated specifically?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, please choose one that is clear
  and easy to interpret.

  2. Yes, I would like tooltips to show the exact number of courses for each city.

  3. I do not know, any default map style should be fine.

  4. Yes, including country borders and major city markers would be helpful for context.

  5. I am not sure, please choose the gradation method that best represents the data.

  6. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color intensity scale.

  7. I do not have any specific cities or regions to be highlighted or annotated.'
