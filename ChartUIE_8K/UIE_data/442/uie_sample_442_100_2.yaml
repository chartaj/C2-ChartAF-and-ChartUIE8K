initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing mobile subscriptions across different
  countries and how they have evolved over the years. Highlight countries in Asia
  to emphasize regional differences. Annotate significant data points for context,
  such as the highest and lowest values, to draw attention to key trends. The purpose
  of this map is to provide a clear visual representation of the global distribution
  and growth of mobile technology. Ensure the map is user-friendly with color gradients
  to represent different levels of mobile subscriptions and text annotations for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color gradients for representing different
  levels of mobile subscriptions?

  2. Should specific countries in Asia be highlighted with distinct colors?

  3. Where would you like the text annotations for significant data points to be placed
  on the map?

  4. Do you want any specific countries to be emphasized aside from those in Asia?

  5. What level of detail do you want in the annotations for the highest and lowest
  values?

  6. Are there specific years or time ranges you''d like to be particularly emphasized?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. Would you like a legend or key to be included to explain the color gradients?'
