initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes mobile subscriptions over
  the years across different continents using the given data. The x-axis should represent
  the years from 1990 to 2020, while the y-axis should show the number of mobile subscriptions.
  Each continent should be represented as a separate line to easily compare mobile
  subscription growth trends in Asia, Europe, Africa, America, and Oceania. Make sure
  to include a legend and use different colors for each continent to enhance clarity.
  Additionally, include data markers on each line for significant years to highlight
  key points.

  2. Are there specific years you consider as ''significant years'' for including
  data markers?

  diamonds)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the legend and axis labels?

  5. Should there be any specific gridlines or background settings for the chart?
