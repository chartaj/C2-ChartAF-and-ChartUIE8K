initial_prompt: I'm analyzing global mobile subscriptions and population trends from
  1990 to 2018. Create a dot plot with years on the x-axis and total mobile subscriptions
  on the y-axis. Different dots should represent various continents and each dot's
  size should indicate the total population for that year. Let's highlight any missing
  data points clearly and provide a legend to easily distinguish between continents.
  Make sure to include a title that reflects the focus on mobile subscriptions and
  population growth over time with appropriate axis labels. Please use vibrant colors
  for better visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the dot plot, or should we use "Global
  Mobile Subscriptions and Population Trends (1990-2018)"?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use to represent the different continents?

  3. How would you prefer us to highlight missing data points (e.g., with a different
  shape or color)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the size range of the dots representing
  the total population?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific fonts or font sizes in mind for the title, axis labels,
  and legend?'
