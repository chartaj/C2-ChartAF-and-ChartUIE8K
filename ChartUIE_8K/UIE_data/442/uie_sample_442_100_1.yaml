initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare 'total_pop' and 'mobile_subs'
  across different years for each continent. Highlight significant trends and note
  any missing values in the data. Use text annotations to emphasize years with drastic
  changes in population or mobile subscriptions. This will help understand the growth
  patterns in population and mobile technology adoption over time, providing valuable
  insights for demographic and technological studies. Additionally, indicate the count
  of missing values in 'gdp_per_cap' to address data completeness. This visualization
  is ideal for analyzing trends and disparities across continents.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?\n2. Should\
  \ the bars for 'total_pop' and 'mobile_subs' be differentiated by color or pattern?\n\
  3. How would you like the missing values to be indicated on the chart?\n4. Do you\
  \ have a specific style or format for text annotations to emphasize drastic changes?\n\
  5. Would you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, please specify.\n\
  6. Do you want a legend to differentiate between 'total_pop' and 'mobile_subs'?\n\
  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and annotations?\n\
  8. How detailed should the indication of missing 'gdp_per_cap' values be? \n9. Are\
  \ there any specific trends or years you want us to pay special attention to or\
  \ highlight?\n10. Would you prefer the bars to be sorted in a specific order (e.g.,\
  \ chronological by year)?\n11. Are there any specific design guidelines or branding\
  \ requirements we should follow?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please differentiate by color.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific style in mind.

  5. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. Title: "Comparison of Population
  and Mobile Subscriptions by Continent Over Years". X-Axis: "Year", Y-Axis: "Count".

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Just a simple count of missing ''gdp_per_cap'' values would be fine.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, please sort the bars chronologically by year.

  11. No, I do not have any specific design guidelines or branding requirements.'
