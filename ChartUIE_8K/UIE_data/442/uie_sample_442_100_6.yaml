initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the given dataset to visualize the average
  mobile subscriptions across different continents over various years. The x-axis
  should represent the years from 1990 to 1992, and the y-axis should represent the
  different continents such as Asia, Europe, etc. The color intensity should reflect
  the average number of mobile subscriptions for each continent-year combination,
  providing a clear picture of the growth or decline in mobile subscriptions across
  continents over time. This will help understand regional trends in mobile technology
  adoption.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity scale be linear, logarithmic, or any other specific
  scale?

  3. Do you want grid lines to separate the cells in the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  5. Would you like to include annotations (numeric values) within the heatmap cells?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the title of the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color intensities?

  8. Would you like to see any specific highlights or emphasis on certain years or
  continents?'
