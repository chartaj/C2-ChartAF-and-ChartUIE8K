initial_prompt: I need a column chart that visualizes the summary of missing values
  for each column in the dataset 'Jumia Prices and Ratings for all Products 2024ðŸ”¥'.
  The chart should have the columns 'Product Name', 'Price', 'Details', and 'Rating'
  on the x-axis and the count of missing values on the y-axis. Ensure each bar represents
  the number of missing values for the corresponding column accurately. This will
  help understand data completeness for these product details.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the column chart?

  2. Would you like to add data labels on top of the bars to show the exact count
  of missing values?

  3. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  4. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so, do you have specific names for
  them?

  5. Do you prefer a specific order for the columns on the x-axis, or is the default
  order acceptable?

  6. Would you like to customize the bar widths or spacing between the bars?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the chart labels?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, or is it unnecessary for this visualization?

  9. Are there any specific gridline settings you prefer for the chart background?'
