initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the price trends for Jumia
  products over time. Use the 'Price' column to plot the prices, and the 'Rating'
  column to annotate key points of interest where products have particularly high
  or low ratings. Highlight products with unique pricing structures (e.g., ranges)
  and their corresponding ratings to emphasize distinctions. Ensure the chart vividly
  represents the relationship between price and customer ratings, focusing on long-term
  trends and anomalies. Include context about natural cotton feel or product features
  from the ‘Details’ column as annotations to provide more insights for the viewer.

  4. Is there a specific format for the price (e.g., currency) that you would like
  displayed?

  size)?

  6. Do you prefer the product features from the ''Details'' column to be shown as
  tooltips, callouts, or in a separate legend?

  7. Should the annotations for high or low ratings be displayed directly on the chart
  or as a pop-up when hovered over?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to be used for the text
  annotations?
