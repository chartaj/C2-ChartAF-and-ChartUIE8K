initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing Jumia's 2024 product prices and
  ratings. The x-axis should represent product prices, while the y-axis depicts the
  product ratings. Each bubble will correspond to a product, with the bubble size
  representing the number of unique values in product details. Highlight products
  with the highest and lowest ratings. Annotate those bubbles to display their product
  names, prices, and ratings. Highlight elements with missing rating values in a different
  color. This chart will help users quickly identify the best and worst products based
  on price and ratings.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles representing
  the products?

  2. Is there a preferred color you want to use for highlighting products with missing
  rating values?

  3. Do you have any particular font style or size preferences for the annotations
  displaying product names, prices, and ratings?

  4. Do you want a title for the chart? If so, do you have a particular title in mind?

  5. Should there be labels for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what would you like
  them to be labeled as?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the chart? If yes, do you have a preference
  for their style or color?

  7. Do you have a preferred theme or style for the overall appearance of the chart
  (e.g., minimalist, vibrant)?

  and colors?'
