  labeled on the pie chart?

  4. Would you like to include a title for the pie chart? If so, what should it be?

  5. Should the chart include annotations highlighting the column with the most missing
  values?

  6. Do you have a specific order preference for the slices (e.g., ascending or descending
  by percentage)?
