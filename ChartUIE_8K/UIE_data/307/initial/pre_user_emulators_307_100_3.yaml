- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n \n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a grouped bar chart representing the summary data in the Student End of Term
  Evaluation Survey. Each group should correspond to unique English Lesson Groups
  (S17, S06, S13, etc.). Within each group, create bars for 'With Subtitles', 'Physics
  Course', 'Microbiology Needs', and 'Elective Courses'. The y-axis should show the
  count of each category. Use different colors to distinguish between the categories.
  Ensure the chart is clear to understand trends and satisfaction across the different
  English Lesson Groups. Please include labels and a legend for clarity. Thank you!
