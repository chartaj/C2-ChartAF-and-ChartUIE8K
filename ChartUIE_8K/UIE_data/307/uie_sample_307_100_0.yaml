initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the "Student End of Term Evaluation
  Survey" data. Use "Time Stamp" on the x-axis and plot lines for "With Subtitles,"
  "Physics Course," "Microbiology Needs," and "Elective Course Satisfaction." Highlight
  the unique value points in different colors. Add text annotations for important
  data points, focusing on significant changes over time. The purpose of this visualization
  is to analyze trends in course satisfaction and needs, aiding in education improvements.
  Emphasize key trends and variations to help educators understand student preferences
