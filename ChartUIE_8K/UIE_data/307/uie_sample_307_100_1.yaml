initial_prompt: Imagine a tile map chart visualizing the Student End of Term Evaluation
  Survey data. Each tile represents a unique combination of elective courses and their
  satisfaction levels. Annotations should highlight key areas, such as the most and
  least popular elective courses and their satisfaction scores. Use different colors
  to distinguish between groups (e.g., English Lesson Groups) and highlight the relationship
  between having subtitles and course preferences. The visualization's primary goal
  is to understand how different courses and their attributes (e.g., subtitles, elective
  course satisfaction) are perceived by students, helping educators improve curriculums.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  distinguish between different lesson groups?

  2. What type of tile shape would you prefer for the tile map (e.g., squares, hexagons)?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., tooltips, labels, callouts)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding and symbols used?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart labels
  and annotations?

  6. Would you like the tile map to show a grid layout or a more organic, clustered
  layout?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering or sorting for the elective courses and satisfaction
  levels in the tile map?

  8. Are there any specific titles or captions you want to include in the chart to
  provide context or additional information?

  9. Would you like to exclude any specific data points or categories from the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer hexagons.

  3. Labels would be good for the annotations.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the font style and size.

  6. I prefer a grid layout.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific titles or captions in mind.

  9. I am not sure.'
