initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the end-of-term evaluation survey
  data for students. The heatmap should display the relationships between different
  course categories (e.g., English Lesson Groups, Physics Course, Microbiology Needs,
  Elective Courses) and their respective "Elective Course Satisfaction" scores. It
  would be useful to see how different groups (S17, S06, S13, etc.) are distributed
  across satisfaction levels, and whether variables like "With Subtitles" impact their
  satisfaction. This will help in identifying areas needing improvement in the education
  curriculum and support strategies.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include any specific legend or color scale to indicate satisfaction
  levels?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., course categories
  on the x-axis and satisfaction levels on the y-axis)?

  4. Should we include annotations or labels on the heatmap cells for better readability?

  5. Is there any specific ordering of the course categories or satisfaction levels
  that you prefer?

  6. Would you like to highlight any particular course categories or satisfaction
  levels?

  7. Do you have a specific size preference for the heatmap (e.g., overall dimensions,
  cell size)?

  8. Are there any additional text descriptions or titles you would like to add to
  the heatmap for context?

  9. Do you want to include any reference lines or markers for key satisfaction thresholds?

  10. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?'
