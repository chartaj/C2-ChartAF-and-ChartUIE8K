02_initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart representing the summary data in the
  Student End of Term Evaluation Survey. Each group should correspond to unique English
  Lesson Groups (S17, S06, S13, etc.). Within each group, create bars for 'With Subtitles',
  'Physics Course', 'Microbiology Needs', and 'Elective Courses'. The y-axis should
  show the count of each category. Use different colors to distinguish between the
  categories. Ensure the chart is clear to understand trends and satisfaction across
  the different English Lesson Groups. Please include labels and a legend for clarity.
  Thank you!
