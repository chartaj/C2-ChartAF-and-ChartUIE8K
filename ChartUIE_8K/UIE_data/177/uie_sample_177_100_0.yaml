initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize sentiment distribution in financial
  news articles. Use 'neutral', 'negative', and 'positive' sentiments as sections
  of the donut chart. Highlight each sentiment section with distinct colors for clear
  differentiation. Annotate the chart by displaying the percentage and count of articles
  for each sentiment category in the segmented areas of the chart. This visualization
  helps to quickly understand the overall sentiment trend in financial news and identify
  any prevailing sentiment. Use the business context provided to ensure the chart
  is practical and relevant.
