initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the financial news sentiment analysis
  data from '../Extra_datas/data/177.csv'. Use the "neutral" column for the x-axis,
  representing sentiment classifications (neutral, negative, positive), and the second
  column, "According to Gran...", for the y-axis, showing actual data instances (financial
  news statements). Ensure each sentiment category is clearly distinguishable, possibly
  with different colors or markers, to make trends and patterns in the sentiment data
  easily understandable. Title the chart “Sentiment Analysis of Financial News” and
  label the axes appropriately to reflect the sentiment and data points.

  categories (neutral, negative, positive)?
