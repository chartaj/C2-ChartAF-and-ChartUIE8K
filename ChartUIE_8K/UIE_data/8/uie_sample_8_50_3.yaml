initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of crop production
  across various counties in Kenya based on the 2019 census data. Focus on key crops
  like maize, beans, potatoes, and bananas. Ensure the heatmap displays intensity
  variations effectively to show areas of high and low production.
questions: "1. What color gradient do you prefer for representing low to high production\
  \ intensity on the heatmap?\n2. Would you like the intensity of the colors to have\
  \ specific breaks or ranges (for example, specific thresholds for low, medium, and\
  \ high production)?\n3. Do you prefer the heatmap to include labels for each county\
  \ showing the production quantity of each key crop?\n4. Should the heatmap include\
  \ a legend to explain the color intensity?\n5. Would you like to add a title and/or\
  \ subtitle to the heatmap? If so, what should it be?\n6. Do you have any preference\
  \ for the font style and size used in the heatmap labels and legends?\n7. Would\
  \ you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap to distinguish between different\
  \ counties?\n8. Should the heatmap display a border around each county? \n9. Do\
  \ you want any annotations or highlights for specific counties or crops on the heatmap?\n\
  10. Should the heatmap automatically adjust its size to fit the display medium,\
  \ or do you have specific dimensions in mind?"
