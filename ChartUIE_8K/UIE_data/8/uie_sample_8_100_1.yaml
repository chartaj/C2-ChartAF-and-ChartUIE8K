initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of crop production
  across various counties in Kenya based on the 2019 census data. Incorporate text
  annotations to highlight key values for crops like maize, beans, and cassava to
  draw attention to significant production figures. Use color highlights to distinguish
  between different crops and emphasize their respective production volumes. The purpose
  of this visualization is to provide insights into agricultural output and identify
  regions with high or low production levels, aiding in resource allocation and policy-making
  for agricultural development.
questions: "1. Do you have preferred colors for distinguishing between different crops\
  \ (maize, beans, cassava)?\n2. Are there any specific counties you would like to\
  \ highlight or focus on in the visualization?\n3. What font style and size do you\
  \ prefer for text annotations on the histogram?\n4. Do you have a specific format\
  \ for displaying key values (e.g., value labels, percentage)?\n5. Do you prefer\
  \ a specific layout for the histogram (e.g., horizontal vs. vertical bars)?\n6.\
  \ Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the histogram for better readability\
  \ of the data?\n7. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and titles (e.g.,\
  \ wording, font size)?\n8. Should there be legends included in the visualization\
  \ to explain the color coding of crops? If yes, where would you prefer the legend\
  \ to be placed? \n9. Do you want to include a title for the histogram? If yes, what\
  \ should it be?\n10. Do you prefer any specific format for the numerical data (e.g.,\
  \ commas, decimal places)?\n"
answers: "1. I do not have specific preferences for colors. \n2. I am not sure.\n\
  3. I prefer a readable font style and size, but I do not have specific preferences.\n\
  4. I would prefer value labels to display key values.\n5. I have no specific preference\
  \ for the layout.\n6. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.\n7.\
  \ I do not know.\n8. Yes, please include legends. I do not have a preference for\
  \ the placement.\n9. Yes, the title should be \"2019 Crop Production Distribution\
  \ Across Kenyan Counties\".\n10. I do not have a specific preference for the numerical\
  \ data format."
