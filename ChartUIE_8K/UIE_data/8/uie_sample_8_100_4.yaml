initial_prompt: Please create a treemap chart to visualize the distribution of crop
  production in Kenya according to the 2019 census. Utilize the provided CSV dataset
  and ensure the chart reflects the various counties and sub-counties, highlighting
  the production quantities for different crops such as maize, sorghum, rice, potatoes,
  beans, cassava, sweet potatoes, and more. Focus on providing a clear hierarchical
  view of the contribution of each region to the overall crop production. Include
  labels and color coding to differentiate between the various crop types effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between various
  crop types?

  2. How would you like the labels to be presented (e.g., crop name, production quantity,
  both)?

  3. Should there be any specific font style or size for the labels?

  4. Do you want to include any additional annotations or legends?

  5. Are there any specific counties or sub-counties that should be highlighted or
  given special attention?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout for the treemap (e.g., squarified, slice-and-dice)?

  7. How would you like to handle counties or sub-counties with missing data or negligible
  production for certain crops?

  8. Would you like to include any supplementary information such as total production
  per county or sub-county?

  9. Do you have a preference for the chart''s title and any additional descriptive
  text?

  10. Are there any accessibility considerations we should account for (e.g., color-blind
  friendly palette)?'
