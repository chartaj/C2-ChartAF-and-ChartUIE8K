initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart visualizing the crop production distribution
  in Kenya based on the 2019 census data. The chart should display the total numbers
  for different crops like Maize, Sorghum, Rice, Potatoes, Beans, Cassava, Sweet Potatoes,
  etc., as separate sections within the columns for each county/sub-county. Please
  include text annotations highlighting significant crops for major counties to draw
  attention. Also, use highlights to make the most important data points, like the
  highest production values, stand out easily. The visualization will help in understanding
  agricultural patterns and planning resources.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the significant crops to be annotated? Should they have special
  markers or specific text styles?

  3. Do you prefer any specific fonts for the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include any legends, and if so, where should they be positioned?

  5. Are there any specific counties or sub-counties you want to be highlighted more
  prominently?

  6. Do you have a preference for the axis labels and tick formats, such as font size
  or orientation?

  7. Should the chart include data labels for each segment of the columns?

  8. Do you prefer any specific stacking order for the crops in each column?

  9. Are there any additional gridlines or reference lines you would like to include
  in the chart?'
