initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of crop production
  in different counties/sub-counties of Kenya from the 2019 census. Use 'County/Sub
  County' on the X-axis and crop quantities (e.g., Maize, Beans, Cassava, Bananas)
  on the Y-axis. Each crop type should be represented by different colored markers.
  Also, include missing data handling to ensure accuracy. Show variations and concentrations
  in crop production. Add labels for clarity. Highlight counties with exceptionally
  high or low production values to identify outliers and trends in the agricultural
  landscape of Kenya. This will help in understanding the regional distribution of
  crop production.
questions: "1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for representing different crops\
  \ on the scatter plot?\n2. Do you have a preference for the shape or size of the\
  \ markers for different crops?\n3. Would you like trend lines to be included for\
  \ better visualization of the data trends?\n4. Should the outliers be highlighted\
  \ with specific annotations or different marker styles?\n5. Do you prefer any specific\
  \ method for handling missing data?\n6. Do you have a preference for the orientation\
  \ or style of the labels for better clarity?\n7. Would you like additional grid\
  \ lines or background elements to enhance readability? \n8. Are there any specific\
  \ counties or sub-counties you would like to highlight or emphasize in the visualization?"
