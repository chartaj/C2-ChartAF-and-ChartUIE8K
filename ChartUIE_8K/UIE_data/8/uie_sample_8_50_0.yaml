  4. Do you have a preferred method of displaying data annotations for key crops (e.g.,
  labels, tooltips)?

  5. What level of detail do you prefer for the annotations (e.g., exact values, percentage
  ranges)?

  6. Should the map highlight major production areas with special markers or labels?

  7. Do you need any additional geographical features (e.g., rivers, borders) highlighted
  on the map?'
