initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique values
  for the 'sl' column from the dataset on human stress detection during sleep. The
  chart should show the proportion of each unique value in the 'sl' column, which
  has 5 distinct values. This will help in understanding how the stress levels ('sl')
  are distributed among the different unique values. Additionally, include labels
  and percentages for each slice to clearly indicate the distribution of stress levels.
  Ensure the design is clear and easily interpretable.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the pie chart?

  2. Do you want the chart to include a legend, or are labels on the slices sufficient?

  3. Should the pie chart slices be ordered in a specific way, such as from largest
  to smallest proportion?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include beyond
  slice labels and percentages?

  5. Do you want the chart to have a title? If so, what should the title be?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and percentages?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a subtle 3D effect, or should it be a standard
  2D pie chart?

  8. Should the chart include exploded slices to emphasize certain stress levels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Labels on the slices are sufficient.

  3. I do not know.

  4. No, just the slice labels and percentages are fine.

  5. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Stress Levels During Sleep".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Standard 2D pie chart is fine.

  8. I do not know.'
