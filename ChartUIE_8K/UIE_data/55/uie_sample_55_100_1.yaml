initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize how different physiological metrics
  relate to stress levels during sleep. Use the columns 'sr', 'rr', 't', 'lm', 'bo',
  'rem', 'sr.1', 'hr', and 'sl'. Annotate key points in the heatmap to highlight high
  and low stress areas. Highlight significant correlations among variables such as
  high heart rate ('hr') and low oxygen levels ('bo'). Ensure the visualization helps
  in identifying patterns and correlations between the metrics for effective stress
  detection during sleep. Include text annotations for clarity. Focus on making the
  chart informative for health and technology sectors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific labels for the axes?

  3. How detailed would you like the annotations to be?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds for stress levels you would like highlighted?

  5. Would you like grid lines displayed on the heatmap?

  6. Do you prefer certain fonts or sizes for text annotations?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend indicating the color scale?

  8. Do you require any specific formatting for numeric values?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitles for the heatmap?

  10. Should certain areas be marked with additional markers or symbols to denote
  significance?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please label the x-axis as ''Physiological Metrics'' and the y-axis as ''Stress
  Levels''.

  3. I would like the annotations to be moderately detailed to ensure clarity.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for fonts or sizes.

  7. Yes, please include a legend indicating the color scale.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include a title "Heatmap of Physiological Metrics and Stress Levels
  During Sleep" and a subtitle "Correlation Patterns for Stress Detection".

  10. I have no specific preference.'
