  4. How would you like the trends to be indicated on the chart (e.g., lines, arrows)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific style or font for the text annotations?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors and symbols used?

  7. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Is there a specific order in which the groups (''sl'') should be displayed?

  9. Are there any particular ranges or thresholds for ''sr'' that you consider to
