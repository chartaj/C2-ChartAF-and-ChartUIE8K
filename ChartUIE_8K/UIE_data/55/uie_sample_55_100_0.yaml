initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'sr', 'rr', 't',
  'lm', 'bo', 'rem', 'sr.1', and 'hr' across different sleep levels ('sl'). Annotate
  specific data points that stand out, for example, the minimum and maximum values
  in each category. Use highlights to make the boxes for 'sr' and 'hr' more prominent,
  as these may be vital indicators of stress. The chart should help identify how these
  metrics vary with different sleep levels to better understand stress detection through
  sleep. Add non-data-driven annotations to provide context on how these metrics are
  relevant for stress analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlights on the
  ''sr'' and ''hr'' boxes?

  2. Are there any specific outlier points that you want to make sure are annotated
  in the chart?

  3. Do you have any preferred style or format for the non-data-driven annotations
  providing context on stress analysis?

  4. Are there specific visual elements you want to use for annotating minimum and
  maximum values (e.g., special markers, labels)?

  5. Would you prefer a particular orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the highlighted boxes and annotations?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for text annotations and labels?

  8. Are there any additional metrics or data points you want to be included in the
  box chart for comparison?

  9. Do you have a preference for the layout of the chart (e.g., size, aspect ratio)?

  10. Would you like the chart to include grid lines or any other specific background
  elements to enhance readability?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Annotate the most extreme outlier points for clarity.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Special markers would be nice for minimum and maximum values.

  5. Vertical orientation is preferred.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. No, just the metrics mentioned are fine.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.
