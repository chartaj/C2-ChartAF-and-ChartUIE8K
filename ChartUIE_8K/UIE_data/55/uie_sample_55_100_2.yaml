initial_prompt: Visualize a bar chart showing variations in sleep metrics. Use 'sr',
  'rr', 't', 'lm', 'bo', 'rem', 'sr.1', 'hr', and 'sl' as bar categories on the x-axis
  with their respective mean values on the y-axis. Highlight the 'sr' and 'rem' bars
  since these are crucial for stress detection during sleep. Include text annotations
  for 'sr' and 'rem' bars to display their exact mean values to emphasize their importance.
  This visualization aids in identifying which metrics are most indicative of stress
  levels, contributing to better sleep health management.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars, especially for the
  ''sr'' and ''rem'' categories?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations displaying

  4. Do you prefer a specific range or scaling for the y-axis values?

  5. Would you like gridlines included in the background of the chart?

  borders?

  9. Should we include any additional annotations or markers besides those on the

  chart?'
