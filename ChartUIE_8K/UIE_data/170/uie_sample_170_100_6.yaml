initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that displays the average GPA for different parental
  education levels from the students performance dataset. The parental education levels
  should be categorized from 1 to 5, where 1 represents less than high school and
  5 represents bachelor's degree or higher. The y-axis should represent the average
  GPA and the x-axis should represent the different levels of parental education.
  This will help to visualize the correlation between parental education and students'
  academic performance. Please make sure to label the axes properly and include a
  legend if necessary. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like to display data values on top of each bar for clarity?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Would you like to include any specific title for the chart?

  6. Is there a particular orientation you prefer (horizontal or vertical) for the
  bars?

  7. Do you want to highlight any specific parental education level in the chart?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the thickness of the bars?

  9. Would you like to include error bars to show variability?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or notes you would like to add to the chart?'
