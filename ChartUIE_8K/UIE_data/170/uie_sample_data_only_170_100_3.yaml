02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset of student performance details. I want to visualize
  the frequency distribution of different grades (GPA) among students. Please create
  a histogram showing the number of students for each GPA range. Ensure the x-axis
  represents the GPA categories (e.g., 0.0-1.0, 1.0-2.0, etc.) and the y-axis represents
  the number of students in each GPA range. Additionally, include another histogram
  for the number of absences among the students, with the x-axis representing the
  range of absences and the y-axis showing the frequency of students within those
  ranges. Thank you!

09_answers: '1. The title for the GPA histogram could be "Distribution of Student
  GPAs". For the absences histogram, "Distribution of Student Absences".

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, include grid lines on the background.

  6. No specific labels or annotations are needed.

  7. Basic axis labels like "GPA Range" and "Number of Students" for GPA histogram,
  and "Absence Range" and "Number of Students" for the absences histogram are fine,
  no specific font preference.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
