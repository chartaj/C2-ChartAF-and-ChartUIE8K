02_initial_prompt: I would like a line chart visualizing the `StudyTimeWeekly` and
  `GPA` of students from the dataset. The x-axis should represent `StudentID` and
  the y-axis should have dual scales for `StudyTimeWeekly` and `GPA`. This will help
  to see if there is a correlation between the amount of time students spend studying
  each week and their GPA. Make sure to include data points, lines connecting them,
