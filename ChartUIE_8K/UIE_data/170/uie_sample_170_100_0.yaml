initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the ðŸ“š Students Performance Dataset ðŸ“š. Plot
  variables such as StudyTimeWeekly, GPA, Absences, and ParentalEducation against
  each other. Use text annotations to highlight key data points, especially those
  with high or low values. Emphasize areas with high correlation using highlights
  to discern patterns easily. The visualization should help educators identify factors
  significantly affecting student performance, thus aiding in targeted academic interventions.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap?

  2. What range of values should the color gradient represent?

  3. Do you have any specific colors you want to use for highlighting areas of high
  correlation?

  4. Is there a preferred style or size for text annotations?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient?

  6. Would you like any specific formatting for the axis labels or titles?

  7. Are there any specific data points (i.e., high or low values) that you want annotated?

  8. How should the high and low-value annotations be formatted (e.g., font size,
  color)?

  9. Do you want the heatmap to include any grid lines or borders between the cells?

  10. Would you prefer a specific order for displaying the variables on the heatmap
  axes (e.g., alphabetical or by significance)?

  11. Is there a particular size or dimension for the heatmap that you prefer?'
