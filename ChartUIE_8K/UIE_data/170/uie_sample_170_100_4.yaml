initial_prompt: I would like a line chart visualizing the `StudyTimeWeekly` and `GPA`
  of students from the dataset. The x-axis should represent `StudentID` and the y-axis
  should have dual scales for `StudyTimeWeekly` and `GPA`. This will help to see if
  there is a correlation between the amount of time students spend studying each week
  and their GPA. Make sure to include data points, lines connecting them, and labels
  for clarity. This chart will be useful for analyzing student performance trends
  in relation to their study habits.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''StudyTimeWeekly'' and ''GPA''?

  2. How would you like to format the labels on the x-axis (i.e., ''StudentID'')?

  3. Do you prefer any specific markers for the data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart? If yes, do you have any
  preferences regarding their style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to indicate which line represents ''StudyTimeWeekly''
  and which represents ''GPA''?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  7. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the chart?

  8. Do you prefer the dual y-axes to have a specific range or scaling method for
  ''StudyTimeWeekly'' and ''GPA''?

  9. Should the chart include any annotations or highlights for specific data points
  or trends?'
