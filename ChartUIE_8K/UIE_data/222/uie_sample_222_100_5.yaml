initial_prompt: 'Create a bar chart that compares the average temperatures and average
  wind speeds of the top 10 cities with the highest temperatures in the dataset provided.
  The x-axis should represent the cities, and the y-axis should have two sets of bars:
  one for the average temperature (in Celsius) and one for the average wind speed
  (in m/s). Use different colors for temperature and wind speed bars for easy differentiation.
  Make sure to label the axes and include a legend. The chart should visually highlight
  the contrast between temperature and wind speed across these cities.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the colors used for temperature
  and wind speed bars?

  2. How would you like the cities to be sorted on the x-axis (e.g., ascending, descending
  order of temperature)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like any additional annotations or notes to be included on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability? If so, do you
  have a preference for their style or color?'

  5. Comparison of Average Temperatures and Wind Speeds in Top 10 Hottest Cities.

  6. I do not have any preference.

  7. Yes, include gridlines, but I have no specific preference for their style or
  color.
