initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the Top 100 Cities Weather Dataset. Plot cities
  on one axis and temperatures in Celsius on the other. Use different colors to represent
  varying wind speeds.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing varying wind
  speeds?

  2. Would you like the city names to be displayed in full or abbreviated?

  3. Should the temperature axis use a specific range or automatically adjust based
  on the data?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels on the axes?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preference for the ordering of the cities (alphabetical, by temperature,
  by wind speed)?

  7. Should we include a legend to explain the color coding for wind speeds?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights for particular cities or temperatures?

  9. Would you prefer the heatmap to be a certain size or aspect ratio?

  10. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to use for the heatmap?'
