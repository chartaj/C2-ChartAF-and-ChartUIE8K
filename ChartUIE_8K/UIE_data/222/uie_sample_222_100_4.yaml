initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the cities' latitude and longitude
  from the Top 100 Cities Weather Dataset. Each point should represent a city, with
  the x-axis displaying the longitude and the y-axis displaying the latitude. Additionally,
  use different colors or shapes to distinguish the cities based on their country.
  This chart will help to visualize the geographic distribution of the cities in the
  dataset and identify any patterns related to their locations. Ensure the chart is
  clear and includes appropriate labels for better understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between countries?

  2. Do you want to use different shapes as well as colors to represent different
  countries, or just one of these?

  3. Should the country information be displayed in a legend?

  4. Are there specific labels you would like to include for each city, such as the
  city name?

  5. How detailed do you want the axis labels to be (e.g., showing only degrees of
  latitude/longitude, or more precise coordinates)?

  6. Should the plot include grid lines for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and legend?

  8. Would you like to add any additional annotations or markers to highlight certain
  cities or regions?

  9. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, do you have a preference
  on what they should be?

  10. Do you need to include a source note or attribution for the data used in the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Just colors would be fine.

  3. Yes, the country information should be displayed in a legend.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Showing only degrees of latitude/longitude is sufficient.

  6. Yes, including grid lines would be good for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, the chart should include a title and subtitle. I prefer the title "Geographic
  Distribution of Top 100 Cities" and the subtitle "Latitude and Longitude Based Visualization."

  10. I do not know.'
