initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap to visualize the Top 100 Cities Weather Dataset.
  For the heatmap, each row should represent a city, and each column should represent
  one of the following attributes: Temperature (Celsius), Wind Speed (m/s), Latitude,
  Longitude, and Description frequency (e.g., the count of ''clear sky''). The cells
  should be color-coded based on the values, with different intensities indicating
  different ranges. This will help in comparing the weather conditions across different
  cities visually. Kindly include labels and a color legend for clarity. Thank you!'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have a preference for the color intensity range (e.g., light to dark)?

  3. Should we include a specific label or title for the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the cities (rows) be sorted in any specific order (e.g., alphabetically,
  by temperature)?

  6. Do you want a specific range or scale for any of the attributes (e.g., temperature
  range from -10 to 40 degrees Celsius)?

  7. Would you like to highlight any specific cities or weather conditions in the
  heatmap?

  8. Do you have preferences for the size and aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  9. Should we include any additional annotations or markers on the heatmap?'
