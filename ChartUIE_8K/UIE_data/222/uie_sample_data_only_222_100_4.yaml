  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Just colors would be fine.

  3. Yes, the country information should be displayed in a legend.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Showing only degrees of latitude/longitude is sufficient.

  6. Yes, including grid lines would be good for better readability.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, the chart should include a title and subtitle. I prefer the title "Geographic
