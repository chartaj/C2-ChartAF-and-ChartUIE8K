initial_prompt: Create a line chart depicting the Temperature (Celsius) over Latitude
  for different Cities. Annotate with data-driven markers for extreme temperatures
  and use color highlights to distinguish between unique countries. This visualizes
  geographical temperature variations practically, aiding in climate analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between unique
  countries?

  2. Would you like specific markers to be used for annotating extreme temperatures?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to indicate the different countries?

  4. Do you have a preference for the type of annotations used for extreme temperatures
  (e.g., text labels, symbols)?

  5. Is there a specific range or threshold you consider for defining ''extreme temperatures''?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have axis labels and titles? If yes, do you have specific
  titles in mind?

  8. Should the chart include data point labels for each city, or only for certain
  key points?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for textual elements in the chart?

  10. Would you like a specific layout or orientation for the chart (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical layout)?'
