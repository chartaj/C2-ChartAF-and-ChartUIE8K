initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart from the Rotten Tomatoes Top Movies
  Ratings dataset. The x-axis should represent movie titles. Stack the bars based
  on critic scores and people's scores for each movie. Use different colors for critic
  scores and people's scores for clear differentiation. The y-axis should range from
  0 to 100, representing the scores as percentages. Ensure each column is labeled
  with its respective movie title, and include a legend for critic and people scores.
  Title the chart "Critic vs. People Scores for Top Movies."
