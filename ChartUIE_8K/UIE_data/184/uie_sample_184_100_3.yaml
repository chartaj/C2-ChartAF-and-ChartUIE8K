initial_prompt: Generate a scatter plot for Rotten Tomatoes Top Movies Ratings and
  Technical dataset. Plot critic_score on the x-axis and people_score on the y-axis.
  Each point represents a movie, and the size of the points should represent the total_reviews.
  Color the points based on the genre. Additionally, include tooltips to show the
  title, year, and synopsis for each data point. This will help visualize the relationship
  between critic scores and audience scores, and how they correlate with the number
  of reviews and genre diversity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for the points based on genre?

  2. Would you like a specific shape for the points, or are default circles acceptable?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific limits or scaling (e.g., logarithmic)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed on the
  chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the size range of the points based on total_reviews?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for their appearance?

  8. Should the chart have specific annotations or markers for particular data points?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  minimalistic, detailed)?

  10. Would you like the data points to be slightly transparent to help with overlapping
  points?'
