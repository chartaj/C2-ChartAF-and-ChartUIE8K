initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart to visualize the Rotten Tomatoes movie data.
  Each bubble should represent a movie, sized by its total reviews. The x-axis will
  be the critic score, and the y-axis the people score. Different genres will be color-coded.
  Include tooltips to show the synopsis, director, and producer when hovering over
  a bubble. Y-axis (people score) should range from 0 to 100, and x-axis (critic score)
  from 0 to 100. This will help see the correlation between critic and people scores
  across different genres.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to denote different
  genres?

  2. Would you like the bubbles to have any specific opacity to distinguish overlapping
  bubbles better?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for the tooltip text?

  4. Should the size of the bubbles be scaled linearly or logarithmically based on
  the total reviews?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability of scores?

  6. Are there any particular styles or themes you prefer for the overall look of
  the chart (e.g., minimalist, vibrant, classic)?

  7. Would you prefer a legend that explains the color codes for different genres
  placed inside or outside the chart?

  8. Should the chart have a title and axis labels, or is the focus solely on the
  data points? If yes, what titles and labels should be used?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, a bit of opacity would help distinguish overlapping bubbles better.

  3. I do not have any specific preference.

  4. Logarithmically might be better to represent the wide range of total reviews.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have any specific preference.

  7. Outside the chart would be preferable.

  8. Yes, please include titles and labels. The chart title should be "Rotten Tomatoes
  Movie Scores", x-axis label as "Critic Score", and y-axis label as "People Score".'
