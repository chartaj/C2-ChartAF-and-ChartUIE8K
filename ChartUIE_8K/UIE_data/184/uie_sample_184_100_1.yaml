initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize Rotten Tomatoes movie ratings (critic
  and people scores) over different years for top movies. Highlight notable outliers
  with text annotations to emphasize high and low scores. The chart should differentiate
  genres using color coding. Use annotations to highlight standout movies from the
  dataset, such as top-grossing or most reviewed movies. The chart will offer insights
  into how movie ratings vary by year and genre, drawing attention to the highest-rated
  films. Add context with production companies and directors to provide a comprehensive
  overview.
