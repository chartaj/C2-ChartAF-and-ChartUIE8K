initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to compare critic scores and people scores
  for various top movies. Highlight and annotate movies with the highest scores for
  better visibility. The chart should have movie titles on the x-axis and scores on
  the y-axis. Include text annotations to show the exact scores for "Black Panther,"
  "Avengers: Endgame," and "Mission: Impossible -- Fallout" for added clarity. The
  purpose is to visually compare and emphasize the rating differences between critics
  and the general public. Use different colors for critic scores and people scores
  for distinction.'
