initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
  The chart should have the x-axis representing different columns like Pregnancies,
  Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function,
  Age, and Outcome. The y-axis should show the mean values of these columns. Each
  bar should represent the average value of that specific column. This will help in
  comparing the average levels of each feature in the context of diabetes diagnosis.
  Make sure to label the axes appropriately and include a title for the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the bars?

  2. Would you like to include value labels on top of the bars?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the chart title?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be included on the chart?

  6. Would you prefer any specific orientation for the x-axis labels (horizontal,
  vertical, or diagonal)?

  7. Do you wish to include any specific annotations or highlighting on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you want the columns to be displayed on the
  x-axis?'
