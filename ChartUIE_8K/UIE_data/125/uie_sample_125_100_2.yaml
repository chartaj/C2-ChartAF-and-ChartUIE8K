initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships among the features
  in the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Use annotations to highlight key data points
  and interactions, such as high glucose levels or significant correlations between
  features like BMI and Outcome. The visualization should help in identifying patterns
  or trends that indicate the likelihood of diabetes. Focus on using colors effectively
  through highlights to make important areas stand out. Purpose: Guide healthcare
  professionals in pinpointing critical markers for diabetes risk, making it visually
  intuitive to interpret data patterns quickly.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the heatmap to highlight
  important areas?

  2. Would you like to use a gradient of colors to differentiate between high and
  low values, and if so, do you have any preferred color ranges?

  3. Should the annotations for key data points and interactions be limited to certain
  features or values, such as glucose levels above a specific threshold?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font size or style for the annotations to ensure readability?

  5. Would you like to adjust the opacity of the heatmap to enhance the contrast of
  highlighted areas?

  6. Are there particular labels or legends you want to include to make the chart
  more intuitive?

  7. How should extreme values or outliers be represented in the heatmap, if at all?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout or size for the heatmap to ensure it fits well
  in your reports or presentations?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please highlight glucose levels above 140 and significant correlations between
  BMI and Outcome.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for font size or style.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include labels for all features and a legend to explain the color
  gradient.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for layout or size.'
