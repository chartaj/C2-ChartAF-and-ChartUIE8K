initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.
  The plot should visualize the distribution of ‘BMI’ across different ‘Outcome’ values
  (0 and 1). Include text annotations for significant data points, such as the median
  and quartiles, to highlight key insights. Use highlights to distinguish between
  the BMI distributions for those with diabetes (Outcome=1) and those without (Outcome=0).
  The purpose of this visualization is to examine the variation and spread of BMI
  values and understand their relationship with diabetes outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing between
  BMI distributions of the two outcome groups (diabetes and no diabetes)?

  2. Would you like the plot to include grid lines for easier interpretation of the
  data?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or size of the text annotations
  for significant data points?

  4. Should the plot have a particular title or subtitle? If so, please specify.

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like additional information, such as the sample size for each group,
  to be included in the plot?

  7. Is there any preference for the positioning of the legend?

  8. Do you want the plot to follow a specific layout or sizing constraints (e.g.,
  aspect ratio, width, height)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like the plot to include grid lines for easier interpretation of
  the data.

  3. I do not have any specific preference.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of BMI Across Diabetes Outcomes" and the
  subtitle could be "Pima Indians Diabetes Database".

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include the sample size for each group.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
