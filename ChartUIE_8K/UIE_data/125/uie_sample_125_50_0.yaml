initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the number of pregnancies,
  with colors distinguishing diabetes outcomes. Add text annotations for mean glucose
  and BMI values, and highlight columns with the highest diabetes count. The purpose
  is to observe the relation between pregnancies and diabetes.

  4. Do you have any preference for the font size or style for the text annotations?

  5. Is there a specific threshold or criterion for highlighting the columns with
  the highest diabetes count?

  6. Do you want gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  7. Would you like to include axis titles and if so, do you have preferred titles
