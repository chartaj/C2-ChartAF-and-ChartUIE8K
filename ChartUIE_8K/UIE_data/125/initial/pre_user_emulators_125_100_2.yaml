- 'Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships among the features in the Pima
  Indians Diabetes Database. Use annotations to highlight key data points and interactions,
  such as high glucose levels or significant correlations between features like BMI
  and Outcome. The visualization should help in identifying patterns or trends that
  indicate the likelihood of diabetes. Focus on using colors effectively through highlights
  to make important areas stand out. Purpose: Guide healthcare professionals in pinpointing
  critical markers for diabetes risk, making it visually intuitive to interpret data
  patterns quickly.'
