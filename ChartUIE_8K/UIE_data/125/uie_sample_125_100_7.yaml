initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Glucose, BloodPressure,
  and BMI from the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. Separate the data based on the
  Outcome variable to compare the health metrics between those with and without diabetes.
  Ensure that the chart clearly highlights any outliers or variations within each
  group. Additionally, include labels and legends for clarity. This will help to understand
  the correlation between these health indicators and the presence of diabetes among
  the subjects. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like specific colors to represent each category of the Outcome variable?

  3. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and legends?

  4. Do you want any specific numbering format for the Y-axis (e.g., integers, decimals)?

  5. Should the outliers be represented in a specific way (e.g., different shapes
  or colors)?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the chart?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the order in which the health metrics (Glucose,
  BloodPressure, BMI) are displayed?

  9. Should the boxes display any additional statistics (e.g., median, quartiles)
  within them?

  10. Is there a preference for the layout of the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, please use different colors to represent each category of the Outcome variable.

  3. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  4. Integers would be preferred for the Y-axis.

  5. I am not sure about the representation of outliers.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines in the chart.

  7. Title: "Distribution of Health Metrics by Diabetes Outcome"

  8. I have no specific preference for the order of the health metrics.

  9. Yes, please display median and quartiles within the boxes.

  10. I have no specific preference for the layout of the legend.'
