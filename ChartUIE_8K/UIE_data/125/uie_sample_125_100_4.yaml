initial_prompt: I'd like to create a bubble chart to visualize the Pima Indians Diabetes
  Database. Please plot BMI on the x-axis and Glucose on the y-axis. The bubble sizes
  should represent the Age of the individuals, and the bubble colors should indicate
  the Outcome (0 for non-diabetic and 1 for diabetic). Make sure to label the axes
  accordingly and provide a legend for the bubble sizes and colors. Also, please ensure
  that the chart is clear and easy to interpret for a health-focused audience. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the scale of the axes (linear or logarithmic)?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for indicating the Outcome categories?

  3. What range of values should the bubble sizes cover for the Age attribute?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Do you want to display data point labels directly on the bubbles?

  7. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a preferred title?

  8. Are there specific limits you would like to set for the x-axis or y-axis?

  9. Do you prefer a particular format for the legend (horizontal or vertical)?

  10. Do you want to include any reference lines on the chart (e.g., average lines
  for BMI or Glucose)?'
