initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing correlations in the Pima Indians Diabetes
  dataset. Highlight significant correlations. Annotate key areas, such as high glucose
  levels' impact on diabetes outcome, to focus attention.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer a specific range of colors to represent the strength of the
  correlations?

  3. How would you like the significant correlations to be highlighted (e.g., by using
  a different color, bold borders, etc.)?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds you consider for a correlation to be deemed
  significant?

  5. Do you have preferences for the annotation style for key areas (e.g., tooltips,
  textual annotations, arrows)?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to explain the color gradient and correlation
  strength?

  7. Do you have any specific formatting preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Should the heatmap include gridlines to separate cells?

  9. Do you have any particular font styles or sizes for the text annotations and
  labels?

  10. Are there any additional elements or information you would like to include in
  the heatmap?'
