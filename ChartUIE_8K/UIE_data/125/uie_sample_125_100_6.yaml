initial_prompt: I have a dataset regarding diabetes from the Pima Indians Diabetes
  Database. I want to create a scatter plot to visualize this data. Specifically,
  I would like a scatter plot that plots ‘Glucose’ on the x-axis and ‘BMI’ on the
  y-axis. Additionally, I want to differentiate the points using colors to represent
  the ‘Outcome’ column, where different colors represent whether a person has diabetes
  (1) or not (0). Please ensure the axes are labeled, and there is a legend to indicate
  the color representation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing the ''Outcome''
  values (1 and 0)?

  2. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  3. Would you like to customize the size or style of the points in the scatter plot?

  4. Should we include grid lines on the chart for easier interpretation, and if so,
  do you have a preference for their appearance?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  the legend?

  6. Would you like any annotations or additional text on the chart to highlight key
  insights?'
