initial_prompt: Create a donut chart using the provided browser usage data. The chart
  should visually represent the "Usage share" percentages for each browser. Use text
  annotations to display the exact usage share percentage for Chrome, Safari, and
  Internet Explorer & Edge. Additionally, apply highlights to emphasize Chrome’s dominant
  share by making its segment more prominent in size and color. This visualization
  aims to help users quickly identify the most popular web browsers and their respective
  market shares, making it useful for presentations in the technology sector.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the donut chart?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text annotations?

  3. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart, or do you prefer it to rely
  solely on text annotations?

  4. How would you like the segments of the chart to be ordered (e.g., by share percentage,
  alphabetically by browser name)?

  5. Is there a specific layout preference for the chart (e.g., chart-centered, text
  annotations inside or outside the donut)?

  6. Should there be labels for all browsers, or just for Chrome, Safari, and Internet
  Explorer & Edge?

  7. Do you prefer any specific style for highlighting Chrome’s segment (e.g., border,
  shadow, gradient)?'
