initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to represent the market share of different
  web browsers. The chart should have browsers on the x-axis and their usage share
  on the y-axis. Use data that includes browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Internet
  Explorer & Edge with corresponding percentages. Each browser's bar should reflect
  its respective usage share. The chart will help visualize the popularity of each
  browser for a tech analysis. Also, ensure the chart is clear and easy to read, as
  it's for a technology-related presentation. No missing values and use suitable colors
  for differentiation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  bars representing each browser?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels showing the exact usage share
  percentages for each browser?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Are there any particular ways you would like the bars to be ordered (e.g., descending
  usage share, alphabetical)?

  5. Would you prefer a specific chart title or should it be a default one like ''Market
  Share of Web Browsers''?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the background color of the chart?

  7. Should the axis lines and ticks be displayed in a particular style or color?

  8. Do you want grid lines to be included in the chart, and if so, what style or
  color do you prefer?'
