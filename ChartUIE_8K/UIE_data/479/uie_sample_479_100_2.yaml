initial_prompt: Create an icon chart visualizing the browser usage share data. Each
  browser should have an icon (e.g., Chrome logo for Chrome, Safari logo for Safari).
  The chart should emphasize the usage share by scaling the size of each icon according
  to the percentage. Use text annotations to display the exact usage share percentages
  next to each corresponding icon. The primary purpose of this visualization is to
  highlight the dominance of Chrome, followed by other browsers. Use color highlights
  to distinguish between different browsers, making it easier for viewers to quickly
  understand the data distribution in the context of technology usage trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  different browsers?

  2. Is there a particular layout you prefer for the icon chart (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, grid)?

  3. Would you like to include any additional annotations or labels besides the usage
  share percentages?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you prefer for the annotations?

  5. Do you have a preferred size range for the icons based on the percentage values?

  6. Should we include any additional context or explanatory notes in the chart to
  help the audience interpret the data?

  7. Are there any specific icons or images you would like to use for each browser,
  or should we use standard browser logos?

  8. Would you like to include legends or a key to explain the color coding and icon
  sizing?'
