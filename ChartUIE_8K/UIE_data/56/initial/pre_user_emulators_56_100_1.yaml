  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap to visualize the Apple stock data, showing correlations between
  variables like Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume from 1980-12-12 to
  the recent date. Add text annotations to highlight specific values and trends over
  time, especially focusing on peak volumes and significant price changes. Use highlights
  to distinguish key periods, such as market highs and lows. The purpose is to clearly
  present stock performance trends and make it easier to identify important financial
  events and anomalies in Apple's historical stock data.
