initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the historical stock data for
  APPLE. The chart should include multiple lines for the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close',
  and 'Adj Close' prices over time. Use the 'Date' column as the x-axis to show the
  timeline. Ensure the y-axis represents the stock prices. Additionally, add a secondary
  y-axis to depict the 'Volume' of stocks traded. The goal is to see the price trends
  over time and compare the trading volume on the same chart. This will help understand
  price movement and trading activity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing ''Open'',
  ''High'', ''Low'', ''Close'', and ''Adj Close'' prices?

  2. What style would you like the lines to be (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. Are there specific date ranges you want to focus on or highlight on the x-axis?

  4. Do you prefer a particular type of marker (e.g., circle, square) for data points
  on the lines?

  5. How would you like the secondary y-axis for ''Volume'' to be formatted (e.g.,
  color, scale)?

  6. Would you like to include data labels or tooltips for specific data points?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis titles and chart title font sizes and
  styles?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  9. Are there any annotations or reference lines you would like to add to the chart?

  10. How would you like to display the legend (e.g., position, font size, style)?'

  work.

  and styles.
