initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the APPLE stock data. Each point
  should represent daily stock prices, plotting 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' on
  the y-axis. Use text annotations to display significant data points, such as the
  highest and lowest closing prices. Highlight recent trends by changing the color
  of points from the last month. The purpose is to help viewers quickly identify key
  performance patterns over different periods. This visualization will provide insights
  into stock price fluctuations, aiding in investment decisions. Ensure the chart
  is clear and informative for tech and financial analysts.
