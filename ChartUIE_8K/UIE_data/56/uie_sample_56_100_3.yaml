initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualization for the APPLE stock data focusing
  on the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume' columns. The chart
  should display the distribution and range of these stock prices over time. Ensure
  the x-axis represents the date and the y-axis different stock values. The goal is
  to identify any significant outliers or patterns in the stock prices and trading
  volumes. This will help in analyzing the fluctuations in stock values over the given
  time period for better investment decisions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box chart?

  2. Should the box chart include gridlines? If so, do you have a preference for the
  style of these gridlines?

  3. Would you like to include a legend in the chart? If yes, where would you prefer
  it to be positioned?

  4. Do you want to highlight particular data points such as significant highs or
  lows?

  5. Should the chart have titles and labels for the axes? If so, do you have specific
  text for these titles and labels?

  6. Would you like to include annotations for any specific outliers or patterns detected?

  7. Do you have a preference for the date format displayed on the x-axis?

  8. Should the volume be plotted on a secondary y-axis?

  9. Do you want to display all data points, or would you prefer to aggregate the
  data by specific time periods (e.g., weekly, monthly)?

  10. Are there any specific statistical metrics (e.g., mean, median) you would like
  to be displayed alongside the box chart?'
