initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing total revenue by region. Highlight
  regions with highest and lowest revenue. Annotate data points for the regions using
  text annotations to indicate total revenue. This will help understand geographic
  sales distribution effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting regions with
  the highest and lowest revenue?

  2. Would you like the map to include specific geographical boundaries (e.g., countries,
  states, provinces)?

  3. Should the text annotations for total revenue be formatted in a particular way
  (e.g., currency format, decimal places)?

  4. Would you prefer regions with average total revenue to have a different color
  intensity compared to the highest and lowest?

  5. Are there specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  6. Do you want to include a legend or key to explain the color coding on the map?

  7. Should there be a title or subtitle included in the visualization?

  8. Do you prefer specific placement for the text annotations on the map (e.g., centered,
  along the borders of regions)?

  9. Is there a specific map projection you would like to use for the choropleth map?

  10. Would you like any additional context or layers included in the map, such as
  major cities or points of interest?'
