initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the Online Sales Dataset from a popular
  marketplace. Highlight the 'Total Revenue' by 'Product Category' across different
  'Regions' to show the best-performing categories in various markets. Include text
  annotations for the top 3 highest-grossing products to draw attention. This chart
  will help identify which product categories are performing well in different regions,

  methods. This visualization is ideal for business analytics to drive sales strategies.
