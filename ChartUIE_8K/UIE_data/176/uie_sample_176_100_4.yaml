initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the total revenue generated by
  different product categories across various regions. The x-axis should represent
  the product categories, and the y-axis should represent the regions. The cells of
  the heatmap should display the total revenue from sales for each product category
  in each region. Ensure the color gradient increases with higher revenue. Use contrasting
  colors to differentiate between low and high revenue areas clearly. It will help
  us understand which product categories perform best in each region for strategic
  insights. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap''s gradient
  (e.g., shades of blue, red)?

  2. Would you like to include labels for the revenue values in each cell of the heatmap?

  3. Is there any particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient for the revenue
  values?

  5. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to highlight specific regions or categories on the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a particular order for the product categories and regions on the
  axes? For example, sorted by revenue, alphabetically, or custom order?

  8. Should there be any specific annotations or markers for high-performing or low-performing
  regions/categories?'
