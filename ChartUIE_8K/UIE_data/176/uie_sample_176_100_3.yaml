initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart using the given Online Sales Dataset. The
  x-axis should display the 'Date', and the y-axis should show the 'Total Revenue'.
  Each bar should be segmented by 'Product Category' to show the contribution of different
  categories to the total revenue for each date. Use different colors to distinguish
  between categories like Electronics, Home Appliances, and Clothing for clear visualization.
  Please ensure the chart has a legend, and the x-axis labels are rotated for clarity.
  Additionally, include data labels on each segment of the bar to show the precise
  revenue values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different product
  categories?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the axis labels and chart title?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  4. How detailed should the x-axis labels be? Do you prefer short dates (e.g., "Jan
  1") or full dates (e.g., "January 1, 2024")?

  5. Would you like any specific title for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  7. Should there be any specific margin or padding settings around the chart?

  8. Do you want tooltips to appear when hovering over each segment of the bar?

  9. Do you have any specific data label formats in mind (e.g., currency symbols with
  revenue values)?

  10. Would you like to add any annotations or reference lines to highlight particular
  dates or events?'

  6. I don''t have a preference for the legend position.

  7. I am not sure about the margin or padding settings.
