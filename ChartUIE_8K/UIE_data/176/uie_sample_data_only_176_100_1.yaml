  from the Online Sales Dataset for a popular marketplace. Highlight specific product
  categories (Electronics, Home Appliances, Clothing) to emphasize their sales performance.
  Annotate key data points such as maximum and average revenue to draw attention.
  This will help identify revenue trends and performance differences between regions
  and payment methods. Additionally, use color-coding to distinguish between different

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
