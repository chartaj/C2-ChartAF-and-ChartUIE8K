initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showcasing the "Total Revenue" data from the
  Online Sales Dataset by "Region". Highlight regions with the highest sales by using
  distinct colors, and annotate specific data points such as "North America" for high
  revenue and "Asia" for low revenue using text annotations. This visualization serves
  to identify key revenue-generating regions and understand geographical sales distribution.
  Emphasize differences in revenue to quickly pinpoint market strengths and weaknesses
  across different regions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting regions
  with the highest and lowest sales?

  2. Would you like a specific color gradient to show the variation in total revenue
  across different regions?

  3. Do you have any preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  4. How detailed do you want the regional boundaries to be? (e.g., country level,
  state level)

  5. Do you want any additional data overlays or markers apart from text annotations
  for "North America" and "Asia"?

  6. Should there be a legend explaining the color codes used for different revenue
  ranges?

  7. Do you want to include a title and subtitle for the choropleth map? If yes, please
  specify.

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?

  9. Do you have a preference on the positioning of the text annotations for "North
  America" and "Asia"?

  10. Would you like to display the total revenue values directly on the map for each
  region?'
