2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a geographical heatmap to visualize broadband availability across counties
  in the United States. Highlight areas with the highest and lowest broadband access.
  Use annotations to indicate noteworthy trends or regions with particularly high
  or low availability. The map should effectively distinguish high-access areas from
  low-access ones using color coding. Utilize available data columns to create this
  visualization. The purpose is to focus attention on broadband distribution and identify
  areas needing improvement or further analysis. Ensure the chart is clear, informative,
  and provides valuable insights into the broadband landscape across the country.
