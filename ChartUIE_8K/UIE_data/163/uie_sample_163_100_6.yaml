initial_prompt: Please create a column chart using the dataset provided in '163.csv'.
  The chart should illustrate the number of unique values in each column to understand
  the data distribution. Ensure that all relevant columns from the dataset are included,
  and label the x-axis with the column names and the y-axis with the count of unique
  values. Additionally, please title the chart "Unique Values Distribution in US Broadband
  Data" to reflect the context of broadband mapping and analysis across US counties.
  Use different colors for each column to make the chart visually appealing and easy
  to interpret.
