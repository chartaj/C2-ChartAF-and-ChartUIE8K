initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing broadband availability across
  U.S. counties. Highlight areas with higher missing values to draw attention to data
  gaps. Add text annotations for specific regions illustrating broadband coverage
  percentages.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap to distinguish different
  levels of broadband availability?

  2. Should the legend be placed on a particular side of the heatmap (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  3. Do you have specific regions in mind for text annotations, or should we focus
  on the most significant data points?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to use percentile ranges or specific value ranges to define the
  color intensities for broadband availability?

  6. Should the map include state and county boundaries, or focus solely on counties?

  7. Do you want the levels of missing values to be highlighted with a different pattern
  or color than the broadband availability?

  8. Should we include a title and subtitle on the heatmap? If so, do you have preferred
  wording for them?

  9. Do you want to display any additional data (e.g., demographic information) alongside
  the broadband availability information?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure; maybe focus on the most significant data points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I prefer specific value ranges to define the color intensities.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, highlight missing values with a different pattern or color.

  8. Yes, please include a title and subtitle. Something like "Broadband Availability
  in U.S. Counties" and "Identifying Gaps in Data Coverage".

  9. I do not know.'
