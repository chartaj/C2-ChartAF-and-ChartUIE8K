initial_prompt: 'Please create a scatter plot showing the relationship between broadband
  availability and the number of missing values across various data types. Use ''index''
  as the X-axis, representing different data points or entries, and the column ''Data
  is to be used only for analysis purposes related to broadband mapping'' as the Y-axis,
  indicating broadband availability or related information. Points on the scatter
  plot should be marked to highlight missing values in different unnamed columns (Unnamed:
  1, Unnamed: 2, etc.). This will help us visualize the spread and gaps in broadband
  data collection across United States counties.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting the different unnamed
  columns (such as ''Unnamed: 1'', ''Unnamed: 2'', etc.) in the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have a preferred size for the points in the scatter plot?

  3. Would you like to add any specific labels or annotations to the points that highlight
  missing values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific markers (e.g., circles, squares, triangles) to represent
  data points in the scatter plot?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between different unnamed columns
  with missing values?

  6. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  8. Should the Y-axis be scaled in any particular way (e.g., logarithmic scale) to
  better visualize the data?

  9. Do you prefer to have axis titles, and if so, what would you like them to be
  named?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a preferred size for the points.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for markers.

  5. Yes, I would like to include a legend to distinguish between different unnamed
  columns with missing values.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have any specific fonts or font sizes in mind.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, I prefer to have axis titles. The X-axis should be named "Index" and the
  Y-axis should be named "Broadband Availability".'
