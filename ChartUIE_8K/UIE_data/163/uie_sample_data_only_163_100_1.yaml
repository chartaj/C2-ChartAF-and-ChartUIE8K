02_initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing broadband availability by county
  in the United States, based on the given data. Highlight counties with varying broadband
  availability to depict disparities. Use text annotations to point out areas with
  extreme low or high availability, providing crucial context. Ensure the map focuses
  on identifying broadband black spots and well-connected areas. This visualization
  serves to direct attention to critical regions needing infrastructure improvement.
  Annotations must emphasize important disparities, and colors should distinctly reflect
  different levels of broadband access across counties for clear visual communication.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.
