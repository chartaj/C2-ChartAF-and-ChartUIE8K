initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the proportion of high-tech and medium
  industry employment over the years from 1990 to 2015. Use text annotations to highlight
  critical years where significant changes occurred, such as the highest and lowest
  proportions. Also, use highlights to make the important data points stand out and
  indicate the trend over time. The purpose is to analyze employment trends in computers
  and technology sectors over time, providing insights into industry growth or decline.
  Utilize both annotations and highlights to make the chart engaging and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  high-tech and medium industry employment?

  2. Would you like to use different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) to distinguish
  between high-tech and medium industry employment?

  3. Are there any specific years you would like us to mark as critical ones beyond
  the highest and lowest proportions?

  4. Do you have a preferred font type and size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Is there a specific range or scale you would like to see on the y-axis for proportion
  values?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement of highlights or annotations, such
  as exact positions relative to data points?

  8. Are there specific labels you want on the x-axis for selected years, or should
  we label every year from 1990 to 2015?

  9. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability, and
  if so, how prominent should they be?

  10. Do you have any particular preferences for the overall chart size or aspect
  ratio?'
