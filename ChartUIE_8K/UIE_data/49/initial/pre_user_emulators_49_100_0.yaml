2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a column chart displaying the proportion of high-tech and medium industry
  sectors from 1990 to 2015. Highlight key years where there are significant changes.
  Annotate the chart with precise proportions for the years 1990, 2000, and 2010 to
  help the viewer focus on significant points. Use different colors to differentiate
  between high-tech and medium industries, making it visually appealing. Ensure axes
  are labeled clearly and include a legend for easier interpretation. The purpose
  is to track the trend and impact of technology developments over the years.
