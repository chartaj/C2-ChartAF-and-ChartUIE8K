initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the "Total" sales
  in different cities. Use text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest sales
  values. Highlight the bars representing different cities with distinct colors. The
  purpose is to analyze the sales performance in Yangon, Naypyitaw, and Mandalay,
  focusing on where the supermarket performs best and worst. The data visualized must
  be clear for business decision-makers to easily interpret the key insights and understand
  patterns in sales across different branches. Make sure to include context highlighting
  city-wise sales for effective analysis.
