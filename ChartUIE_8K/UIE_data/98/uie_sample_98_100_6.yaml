initial_prompt: 'I want a pie chart to visualize the sales distribution among different
  product lines in the supermarket dataset. The pie chart should show the proportion
  of total sales contributed by each product line. Please use the ''Total'' column
  to calculate the sales figures and the ''Product line'' column to categorize them.
  The data should be segmented based on the six product lines: ''Health and beauty'',
  ''Electronic accessories'', ''Home and lifestyle'', etc. Include percentages or
  labels to make the distribution clear. This will help understand which product lines
  are driving the most revenue.'
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for each segment of the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to display values inside the slices or as a legend outside
  the chart?

  3. Do you prefer the labels to show absolute sales figures, percentages, or both?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the segments to be arranged
  (e.g., descending order of sales)?

  5. Should the pie chart include a title? If so, please provide the desired title.

  6. Do you want to highlight or emphasize any specific product line(s) in the chart?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text and labels on
  the chart?

  8. Would you like the pie chart to include annotations or additional notes for any
  segments?'
