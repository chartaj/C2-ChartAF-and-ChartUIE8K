initial_prompt: I want to create a bar chart that visualizes the sales performance
  of different branches. The x-axis should represent the different branches (A, B,
  and C), and the y-axis should show the total sales amount. Each bar should be divided
  into sections for each product line (like Health and Beauty, Electronic Accessories,
  etc.), so I can see which product lines contribute most to the sales in each branch.
  Please make sure to include the sales data from all branches and product lines available
  in the dataset. Use distinct colors for each product line for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or a specific set of colors for
  each product line?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be stacked or grouped by product line?

  3. Should the chart include numerical labels for total sales on top of each bar?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the y-axis for easier comparison of sales amounts?

  5. Do you have a specific order in which you would like the branches to be displayed
  on the x-axis, or should they be in alphabetical order?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to each
  product line?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Would you like to display the total sales amount for each branch in a tooltip
  when hovering over the bars?

  9. Should the chart include a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?'
