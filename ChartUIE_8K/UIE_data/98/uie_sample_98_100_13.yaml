initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize the data summary for the Sales of a
  Supermarket. Use the 'Product line' for the categories, each proportional to its
  unique values or sales volume. Within each category, further segment by 'City' to
  show the distribution of sales across different cities. Utilize 'Total' as the size
  metric to compare overall sales, and color-code by 'Branch' to distinguish different
  branches. Ensure the chart highlights variations in product performance across locations,
  facilitating a clear understanding of where different product lines sell most effectively.
  This will help identify trends and optimize inventory.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for differentiating between branches?

  2. How many distinct shades or colors would you prefer to use within each branch
  category?

  3. Do you have a preference for labeling each segment within the treemap with specific
  information (e.g., sales figures, percentage share, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer to display the product lines sorted by their overall sales volume
  or in alphabetical order?

  5. Is there a specific threshold for sales volume below which product lines should
  be aggregated or hidden?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations or additional text to highlight specific
  trends or outliers within the treemap?

  7. Is there a preferred font style or size for any text elements within the treemap
  (e.g., labels, titles)?'
