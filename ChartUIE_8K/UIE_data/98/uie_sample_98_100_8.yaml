initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the statistical distribution
  of the unit prices for different product lines in the supermarket sales data. Ensure
  each product line has its own box plot clearly labeled and differentiated by color.
  The chart should highlight any outliers and medians, giving an overall perspective
  on how unit prices vary across categories. Use the data provided in the columns,
  focusing specifically on the 'Product line' and 'Unit price' fields from the sample
  dataset. The goal is to understand price variation within and across product lines.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for each product
  line?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be marked on the box plots?

  3. Would you prefer the median lines inside the boxes to be highlighted in a specific
  color or style?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have any preferences for their style or color?

  5. Do you want to include any specific labels or annotations on the chart (e.g.,
  average values or specific data points)?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you want to use for the labels and titles
  on the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout and size of the chart?

  8. Would you like the whiskers of the box plot to extend to specific percentiles
  other than the default 1.5*IQR?'
