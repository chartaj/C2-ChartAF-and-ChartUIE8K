initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between "Product line"
  and "Quantity" from the supermarket sales data. The x-axis should represent different
  product lines, and the y-axis should represent the quantity sold. Each dot should
  indicate a sale, positioned according to the product line and quantity data points.
  Use different colors for different branches (A, B, C) to distinguish sales locations
  within the same plot. This will help analyze product performance across branches
  and identify trends. Ensure the plot is clear and labeled for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred order for the product lines on the x-axis?

  2. Would you like specific colors for each branch (A, B, C), and if so, which colors?

  3. Should the dots be of a specific size to differentiate the quantity more clearly?

  4. Do you have any preference for the labeling format of the axes?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed for better readability?

  6. Should there be a legend indicating the branches and their corresponding colors?

  7. Do you have a preference for dot transparency to handle overlapping points?

  8. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  9. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to add for key insights?'
