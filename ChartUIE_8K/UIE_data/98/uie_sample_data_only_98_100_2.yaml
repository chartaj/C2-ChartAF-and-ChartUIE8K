02_initial_prompt: I need an area chart that shows the total sales over time for a
  supermarket business. Each area's color should represent different branches (A,
  B, C), and within each branch, differentiate between members and normal customers.
  Please highlight the points of highest sales with text annotations showing the exact
  total and the date. Additionally, use visual highlights to distinguish days with
  high ratings (greater than 9) by making those areas pop out in the chart. The purpose

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
