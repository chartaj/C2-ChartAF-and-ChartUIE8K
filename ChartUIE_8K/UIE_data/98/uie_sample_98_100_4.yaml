initial_prompt: I need a Violin plot to visualize the distribution of "Total" sales
  for different "Product lines" in the supermarket sales data. Let's compare how the
  sales vary across the six different product lines. Also, it would be helpful to
  include the different branches (A, B, C) as an overlay or secondary comparison within
  each Product line. Please make sure to add proper labels and legends for clarity.
  This will help us understand the central tendency, spread, and overall distribution
  of sales across product lines and branches.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the different product
  lines and branches?

  2. Do you prefer any specific order for the product lines to be displayed on the
  x-axis?

  3. Would you like to display any summary statistics (e.g., median, mean) on the
  plot?

  4. What level of grid detailing (e.g., horizontal, vertical) would you prefer on
  the chart?

  5. Is there any specific format or style you prefer for the axis labels and legends?

  6. How would you like the violin plots of branches within each product line to be
  distinguished (e.g., different colors, patterns, or side-by-side)?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart''s text
  elements?

  8. Would you like to include any annotation or additional textual information on
  the chart?'
