initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the average price of different food
  items in Australia from 2018 to 2022. The x-axis should represent the food items
  (e.g., Bread), and the y-axis should show the average prices in AUD. Use different
  colors for each year to show the price trend. Annotate the bars with the exact prices
  to highlight the differences. This visualization will help in comparing the cost
  of essential food items over the years and observing any price changes or trends
  in the Australian market.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each year in the bar
  chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the annotations on the bars?

  3. Should the bars be grouped side-by-side for each year, or stacked on top of each
  other?

  4. Would you like a legend to identify the years by color, or is labeling each bar
  sufficient?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the background color or gridlines in the chart?

  6. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Are there any additional elements, such as a title for the chart or a subtitle,
  that you would like to include?

  8. Do you want the prices to be displayed with a specific format (e.g., rounded
  to two decimal places)?

  9. Would you like to highlight any particular year or food item for emphasis?

  10. Do you prefer a particular orientation for the chart (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  bars)?'
