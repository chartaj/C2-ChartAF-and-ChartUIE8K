initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart showing the proportion of food item prices
  in different countries for the year 2018. Highlight the 'Bread' item and use text
  annotations to display its average price in both local currency and USD. The purpose
  is to visualize the distribution of food costs and highlight the bread price for
  specific insights. Label each slice with the country and food item for clarity.
  Utilize the data provided, focusing on visualizing how food costs vary across nations,
  particularly in 2018. Ensure the quality and availability are noted contextually
  within annotations.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different countries?

  2. How would you like the ''Bread'' item to be highlighted (e.g., a specific color,
  bold outline)?

  3. Do you prefer the average price annotations to be inside or outside the pie slices?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. How should the quality and availability be represented contextually in the annotations
  (e.g., symbols, different text color)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which the countries should appear in
  the pie chart slices (e.g., alphabetical, descending price)?

  7. Would you prefer a legend or should each slice be labeled directly with the country
  and food item?'
