initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Internet and Smartphone Penetration
  Rates by country. Include countries on the y-axis and penetration rates on the x-axis.
  Use distinct color gradients to represent different percentage ranges. Ensure the
  chart is clear and easy to interpret for technology researchers.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used in the
  heatmap?

  2. Should the color gradients have specific cut-off points for percentage ranges?
  If yes, what ranges do you have in mind?

  3. Do you want the countries to be sorted in a specific order on the y-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetically or by penetration rate)?

  4. Would you like to include labels or annotations on the heatmap to show exact
  penetration rates for each country?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size to be used in the heatmap
  for clarity and readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like the countries to be sorted by penetration rate.

  4. Yes, please include labels to show exact penetration rates for each country.

  5. I have no specific preference.'
