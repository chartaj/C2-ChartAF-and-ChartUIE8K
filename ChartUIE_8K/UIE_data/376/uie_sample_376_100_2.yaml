  I need a bubble chart visualizing the Internet and Smartphone Penetration Rates
  by country. Use the data details provided, make sure each country is represented
  as a bubble. The size of each bubble should reflect the Internet Penetration Rate,
  while the color represents the Smartphone Penetration Rate. Include text annotations
  to highlight key countries like India, USA, and Brazil, and use highlights to distinguish
  countries with the highest rates in both metrics. Make it easy to compare and grasp
  the penetration rates at a glance.
