initial_prompt: I'd like a radar chart comparing countries on Internet and Smartphone
  Penetration Rates. The radar chart should use data on the Internet and Smartphone
  Penetration Rates for countries like India, USA, and Brazil. I want each axis to
  represent a country, while the values on the axes should reflect the penetration
  rates for both internet and smartphones. Include a legend to differentiate between
  Internet Penetration and Smartphone Penetration rates. Also, make the chart visually
  appealing with distinct colors and clear labels for easy understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the distinct categories in the
  radar chart?

  2. Would you like any specific font style or size for the labels on the axes?

  3. Is there a particular way you would like the legend to be structured or positioned?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the scaling of the axes (e.g., all axes having
  the same range)?

  5. Are there any specific design elements you would like to include to make the
  chart more visually appealing?

  6. Would you like to include data labels for the penetration rates directly on the
  chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific arrangement of the countries on the radar chart?

  8. Would you like to add any additional annotations or highlight any specific data
  points on the radar chart?

  9. Is there a particular background color or pattern you would like to use for the
  chart?'
