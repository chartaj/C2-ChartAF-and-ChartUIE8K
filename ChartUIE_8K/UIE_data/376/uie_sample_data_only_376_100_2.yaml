  I need a bubble chart visualizing the Internet and Smartphone Penetration Rates
  by country. Use the data details provided, make sure each country is represented
  as a bubble. The size of each bubble should reflect the Internet Penetration Rate,
  while the color represents the Smartphone Penetration Rate. Include text annotations
  to highlight key countries like India, USA, and Brazil, and use highlights to distinguish
  countries with the highest rates in both metrics. Make it easy to compare and grasp
  the penetration rates at a glance.

03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the accurate data and user request, your task is to delve into the user request
  to figure out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select
  the most suitable task that the user is willing to do from the list of various tasks
  in data visualization, (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request
  in data visualization, and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
