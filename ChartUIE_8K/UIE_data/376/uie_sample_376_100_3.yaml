initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap visualizing the Internet and Smartphone Penetration
  Rates by country using the data provided. The x-axis should represent the countries,
  and the y-axis should have the two categories: Internet Penetration Rate and Smartphone
  Penetration Rate. Each cell''s color intensity should reflect the penetration rate
  value, making it easy to compare these rates across different countries. Ensure
  that the heatmap is clearly labeled and includes a color bar legend to denote the
  scale of the penetration rates for better interpretation.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How should the x-axis (countries) be sorted? Alphabetically, by region, or by
  penetration rate?

  3. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the heatmap?

  4. Is there a specific range of penetration rates you would like to highlight or
  focus on?

  5. How detailed should the color bar legend be (e.g., number of intervals)?

  6. Should the heatmap use a gradient or discrete color steps for different penetration
  rate ranges?

  7. Do you prefer a certain font style or size for labels and legends on the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific countries you want to highlight or compare directly?'
