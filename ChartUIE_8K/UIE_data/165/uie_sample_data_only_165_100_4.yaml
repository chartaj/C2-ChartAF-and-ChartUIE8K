  dataset. The chart should display the distribution of different features like Age,
  Air Pollution, Alcohol use, Dust Allergy, etc., across the three levels (Low, Medium,
  High). Highlight outliers and show median values for each variable in the boxplot.
  Make sure the axes are labeled clearly, and each box plot is distinguished by color
  according to the 'Level' of lung cancer risk. This way, we can easily compare the
  spread and central tendency of data for each feature.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  I need a box chart to visualize the data from the lung cancer prediction dataset.
  The chart should display the distribution of different features like Age, Air Pollution,
  Alcohol use, Dust Allergy, etc., across the three levels (Low, Medium, High). Highlight
  outliers and show median values for each variable in the boxplot. Make sure the
  axes are labeled clearly, and each box plot is distinguished by color according
  to the ''Level'' of lung cancer risk. This way, we can easily compare the spread
  and central tendency of data for each feature.
