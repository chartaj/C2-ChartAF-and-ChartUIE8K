initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations in lung cancer risk factors
  like age, smoking, and chronic lung disease. Highlight areas with strong correlations
  and annotate significant data points to emphasize key patterns influencing lung
  cancer levels.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display the exact correlation values on the cells?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the annotation style for significant
  data points (e.g., font size, color, etc.)?

  4. Should the areas with strong correlations be highlighted using a particular method
  (e.g., different color intensity, borders, etc.)?

  5. Is there a specific threshold for what you consider to be a ‘strong’ correlation?

  6. Do you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  vertical vs. horizontal axis)?

  7. Are there any additional labels or legends you’d prefer to include or customize?

  8. Would you like to include any specific contextual data or annotations explaining
  the significance of certain patterns?

  9. Should the heatmap focus on pairwise correlations, or should it also include
  multivariate correlations involving more than two factors?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the size and aspect ratio of the heatmap?'
