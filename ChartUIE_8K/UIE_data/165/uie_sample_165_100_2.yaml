initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualization for predicting lung cancer levels
  using patient data like Age, Air Pollution, Alcohol use, Dust Allergy, etc. The
  chart should have annotations highlighting key insights, such as the correlation
  between high Air Pollution and lung cancer risk level. Also, highlight specific
  elements where notable patterns are found, for instance, if a high percentage of
  'High' Level patients have significant Dust Allergy scores. This will help in understanding
  and focusing on critical risk factors visually. Maintain clarity and ensure each
  histogram bar is labeled with corresponding data. Keep the design clean and insightful.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like to specify a particular font style or size for labels and annotations?

  3. Should the histogram include a legend, or would you prefer the bars to be self-explanatory?

  4. Are there specific intervals or bins you would like for the histogram bars (e.g.,
  specific age ranges)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the positioning of annotations, such as inside or
  above the bars?

  6. Would you like to include any additional elements, such as grid lines or reference
  lines, to enhance clarity?

  7. Are there any specific highlight colors or styles for notable patterns and key
  insights that you''d prefer?

  8. Should the chart have a title, and if so, do you have a preferred title in mind?

  9. Do you want to display values on the histogram bars (e.g., number of patients)
  explicitly?

  10. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the chart, such as margins,
  padding, or border styles?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I think a legend would be helpful.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Above the bars would be preferred.

  6. Yes, grid lines might help with clarity.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, the title could be "Lung Cancer Risk Factors".

  9. Yes, please display the values on the bars.

  10. I do not know.'
