initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the data from the lung cancer prediction
  dataset. The chart should display the distribution of different features like Age,
  Air Pollution, Alcohol use, Dust Allergy, etc., across the three levels (Low, Medium,
  High). Highlight outliers and show median values for each variable in the boxplot.
  Make sure the axes are labeled clearly, and each box plot is distinguished by color
  according to the 'Level' of lung cancer risk. This way, we can easily compare the
  spread and central tendency of data for each feature.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing the ''Level''
  of lung cancer risk?

  2. Would you like the box plots to have specific styles or patterns to emphasize
  the different features?

  3. Do you prefer the outliers to be highlighted with specific symbols or colors?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  titles?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors or styles used for the
  ''Level'' of lung cancer risk?

  6. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plots?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the axes?

  8. Is there any particular order you would like the features to be displayed on
  the chart?

  9. Do you want to display any additional statistics on the box plots such as mean
  values, quartiles, or whiskers'' length?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please highlight outliers with specific symbols or colors.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend.

  6. I prefer vertical orientation for the box plots.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability of the axes.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No additional statistics are needed, just the median values.'
