initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart for Lung Cancer Prediction showing Age, Air
  Pollution, and Genetic Risk. Use Age on the x-axis, Genetic Risk on the y-axis,
  and bubble sizes representing Air Pollution levels. Color code the bubbles according
  to the 'Level' (Low, Medium, High) for better visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different levels
  (''Low'', ''Medium'', ''High'')?

  2. Would you like to include axis labels and titles? If yes, please provide the
  specific text you prefer.

  6. Should the chart include annotations or tooltips to provide more detailed information
  when hovering over the bubbles?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include axis labels and titles. For the x-axis: "Age (years)", for
  the y-axis: "Genetic Risk", and the title: "Lung Cancer Prediction Analysis".

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding and bubble size. I have
