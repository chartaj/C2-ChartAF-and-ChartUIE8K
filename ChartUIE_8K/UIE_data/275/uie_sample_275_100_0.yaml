initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of mismanaged plastic
  waste (tonnes) across different years. Highlight specific years with significant
  plastic waste to draw attention. Use text annotations to provide context for these
  highlighted years, particularly those with higher values. Consider using different
  colors to distinguish various ranges of mismanaged plastic waste. Include a secondary
  histogram showing the coastal population over the same years to explore any correlation.
  The purpose is to understand the trend and impact of a coastal population on waste
  mismanagement. Make sure to highlight the critical points clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing various
  ranges of mismanaged plastic waste?

  2. Are there any specific years you want to highlight as significant for mismanaged
  plastic waste?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or color of text annotations for context
  on highlighted years?

  4. Do you prefer any particular type or style for the secondary histogram showing
  the coastal population?

  5. Should critical points be highlighted with specific markers or additional annotations?

  6. Do you have a specific font preference or size for text annotations and labels?

  7. Would you like any additional statistical information or lines, such as average
  or trend lines, included in the histograms?'
