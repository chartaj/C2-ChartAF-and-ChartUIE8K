initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of mismanaged plastic
  waste (tonnes) over the years. Highlight key years and add annotations to emphasize
  significant data points, such as those correlating with coastal population sizes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like to specify any particular years to be highlighted?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., labels, arrows, text
  boxes)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or font for the text annotations and axis labels?

  5. Should the coastal population sizes be represented in a specific way (e.g., different
  color bars, dual-axis)?

  6. Is there a particular style or format for the legend you prefer?

  7. How detailed should the information in the tooltips be for data points (if any)?

  8. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles in the chart?

  9. Should the chart gridlines be visible, and if so, what style do you prefer?

  10. Are there any specific limits or scale formats you would like for the Y-axis?'
