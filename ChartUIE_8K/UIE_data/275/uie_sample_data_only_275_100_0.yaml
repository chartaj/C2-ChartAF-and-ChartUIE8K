  plastic waste (tonnes) across different years. Highlight specific years with significant
  plastic waste to draw attention. Use text annotations to provide context for these
  highlighted years, particularly those with higher values. Consider using different
  colors to distinguish various ranges of mismanaged plastic waste. Include a secondary
  histogram showing the coastal population over the same years to explore any correlation.

  mismanagement. Make sure to highlight the critical points clearly.
