2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart showing the trend in mismanaged plastic waste against the year
  for various countries. Annotate key points for significant trends and highlight
  countries with a dramatic increase or decrease in plastic waste. This is for environmental
  impact analysis.
