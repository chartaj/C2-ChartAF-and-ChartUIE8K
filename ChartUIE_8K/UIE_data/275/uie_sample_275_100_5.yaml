initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the data from the file coastal-population-vs-mismanaged-plastic.csv.
  The chart should compare different countries (Entities) across years, showing the
  amount of mismanaged plastic waste (in tonnes) on the y-axis and the year on the
  x-axis. Each bar should represent a different country with a legend to indicate
  which bar corresponds to which country. Also, highlight the coastal population overlay
  for better understanding of the environmental impact. This is for an environmental
  science project.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different countries
  in the legend?

  2. How would you like the coastal population to be highlighted (e.g., with a separate
  line, different bar shading, or other)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Should the chart include labels for data values on the bars?

  5. Are there any specific countries or years you would like to focus on or exclude
  from the chart?

  6. What title and axis labels would you like for the chart?

  7. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart text and labels?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, how would
  you like them to be styled?

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or callouts to emphasize certain data
  points or trends?'

  1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure; maybe a different bar shading.

  3. Vertical orientation would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include labels for data values on the bars.

  5. I am not sure; include as many countries and years as possible for a comprehensive
  view.

  6. Title: "Mismanaged Plastic Waste and Coastal Population Over Time", Y-Axis: "Mismanaged
  Plastic Waste (tonnes)", X-Axis: "Year".

  7. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  8. Yes, include gridlines for better readability but style them subtly.

  9. I do not know; any important points or trends you think are important to highlight
  would be good.
