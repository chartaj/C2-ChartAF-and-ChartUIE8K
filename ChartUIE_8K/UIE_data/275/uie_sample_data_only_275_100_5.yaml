  The chart should compare different countries (Entities) across years, showing the
  amount of mismanaged plastic waste (in tonnes) on the y-axis and the year on the
  x-axis. Each bar should represent a different country with a legend to indicate
  which bar corresponds to which country. Also, highlight the coastal population overlay

  1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure; maybe a different bar shading.

  3. Vertical orientation would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include labels for data values on the bars.

  5. I am not sure; include as many countries and years as possible for a comprehensive
  view.

  6. Title: "Mismanaged Plastic Waste and Coastal Population Over Time", Y-Axis: "Mismanaged
  Plastic Waste (tonnes)", X-Axis: "Year".

  7. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  8. Yes, include gridlines for better readability but style them subtly.

  9. I do not know; any important points or trends you think are important to highlight
  would be good.
