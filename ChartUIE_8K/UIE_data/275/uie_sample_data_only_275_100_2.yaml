  Waste (tonnes) over the years. Highlight significant increases with annotations.
  Use different lines for various entities like countries. The chart should illustrate
  how coastal populations correlate with mismanaged plastic waste over time. This
  visualization will help understand environmental impacts and population effects
  on waste management. Include annotations on the chart to emphasize key data points,
  peaks, and trends. Show legends and axis labels for clarity. Ensure missing data
  values are acknowledged in the footnote or chart notes for transparency. Add a title
  related to environmental science impacts.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
