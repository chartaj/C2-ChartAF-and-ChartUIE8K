  1. I am not sure, a visually distinct color scheme would be fine.

  2. I do not know, no specific levels in mind.

  3. I am not sure, maybe around 10 to 15 levels.

  4. No, ''x'' and ''y'' labels are enough.

  5. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  6. I do not know, somewhere it doesn''t obstruct the main plot.

  7. Yes, displaying grid lines would be helpful.

  8. No, there are no specific data points or ranges of interest to be annotated.
