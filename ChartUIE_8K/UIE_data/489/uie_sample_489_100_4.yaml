initial_prompt: I have a dataset with two columns, 'x' and 'y', both of which are
  of type float64 and have no missing values. The dataset represents some kind of
  measurement with values corresponding to calculations over a range of 'x' values
  with respective 'y' results. I would like to visualize this data using a scatter
  plot to observe the relationship between 'x' and 'y'. The scatter plot should have
  'x' values on the horizontal axis and 'y' values on the vertical axis. Please ensure
  the plot is clear and well-labeled, as I plan to use it for a detailed data analysis
  presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the scatter plot points?

  2. Do you require a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should it be?

  3. Should axis labels include units or any specific details?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the plot?

  5. Is there a specific range you would like to set for the x-axis or y-axis?

  6. Do you wish to highlight or annotate any specific data points on the plot?

  7. Would you prefer a legend if different colors or shapes are used for categories
  of points?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  title?

  9. Is there any additional text or notes you would like to include on the chart?

  10. Do you require a trendline or any other reference lines on the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the title should be "Scatter Plot of Measurements".

  3. Yes, please include units if applicable.

  4. I am not sure.
