initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'x' and 'y'
  values from the dataset. Highlight the bins that have the most data points to draw
  attention. Use text annotations to display the number of data points in the highlighted
  bins. This will help us understand the concentration of values and any patterns
  within the data. The goal is to focus on areas with the highest density of points,
  giving insight into their behavior. Ensure the histogram is clear and effectively
  shows the range and frequency of both 'x' and 'y'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  2. Would you like to have separate histograms for ''x'' and ''y'', or a combined
  visualization?

  3. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlighted bins?

  4. What text size and font would you prefer for the annotations displaying the number
  of data points?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be included in the histogram? If so, any specific style
  or color?

  6. Would you like to include axis labels and titles? If yes, please specify the
  labels and titles.

  7. Do you want a legend for the histogram? If yes, any specific details for it?

  8. Are there any specific size or aspect ratio preferences for the histogram?

  9. Would you like to display the histogram with a specific background color or style?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the alignment and positioning of the
  text annotations?'
