initial_prompt: I have a dataset with columns x and y, both containing float values
  with no missing values. The unique values in x are 31 and in y are 23. I want a
  violin plot that shows the distribution of both columns x and y so I can compare
  their distributions visually. Could you create a single violin plot comparing these
  two columns using this data? Please make sure to include both columns in the same
  plot for easy comparison. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the violin plot?

  2. Would you like to display the individual data points on the plot?

  3. Do you want to customize the bandwidth for the kernel density estimate?

  4. Should the plot include a title? If so, what should the title be?

  5. Are there any specific labels or captions you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the violins (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Would you like to add any additional statistical information, such as mean or
  median lines, to the violins?

  8. Is there a preference for grid lines or a background style for the plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, the title should be "Distribution Comparison of Columns ''x'' and ''y''".

  5. For the x-axis, label it as "Columns" and for the y-axis, label it as "Values".

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
