initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset with two columns, ''x'' and ''y'', both of which
  are float values and have no missing values. I need a scatter plot to visualize
  this data. Ensure that the plot includes ''x'' on the x-axis and ''y'' on the y-axis.
  Each point in the scatter plot should represent a pair of values from the dataset.
  Please label the axes appropriately and include a title for the scatter plot. Ensure
  the plot is clear and visually appealing. Thank you!
