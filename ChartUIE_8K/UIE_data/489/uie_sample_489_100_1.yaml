initial_prompt: I would like to create a line chart that visualizes the relationship
  between variables x and y. Both x and y are continuous data with no missing values.
  Highlight the points with the highest and lowest y-values to draw attention. Use
  text annotations to display these specific y-values on the chart to emphasize their
  significance. The purpose is to provide a clear and engaging visual representation
  of the dataset for analytical insights. Make sure the chart is clean and easy to
  interpret for data science and analytics purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the highest and
  lowest y-values?

  2. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  text for them?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color)?

  5. Should the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) be customized in any way?

  6. Do you have specific preferences for the chart''s background (e.g., background
  color, opacity)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend in the chart? If yes, any specific instructions
  for it?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the marker style (e.g., shape, size) used to
  highlight the highest and lowest y-values?

  9. Should the x-axis and y-axis scales be adjusted in any particular way (e.g.,
  log scale)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or reference lines (e.g.,
  average line, median line) on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure if gridlines are necessary.

  3. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. You can use "Relationship between
  x and y" for the title, "x" for the x-axis, and "y" for the y-axis.

  4. I prefer the text annotations to be clearly readable, maybe use a slightly larger
  font size and a contrasting color for emphasis.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the line style.

  6. I am not sure about the chartâ€™s background preferences.

  7. I do not know if a legend is necessary, but if you think it will help, please
  include it.

  8. I do not have specific preferences for the marker style.

  9. I do not have any preference for adjusting the x-axis and y-axis scales.

  10. I do not have any preferences for additional annotations or reference lines.'
