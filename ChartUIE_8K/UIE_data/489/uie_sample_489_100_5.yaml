initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the data provided in the file '../Extra_datas/data/489.csv'.
  The chart should visualize the distribution of values for the columns 'x' and 'y',
  showcasing the range, median, and any potential outliers within the dataset. Ensure
  to label the axes appropriately for clarity. This will help in understanding the
  overall spread and variations in the data for both columns. Thank you!
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box chart?\n\
  2. Would you like to add gridlines to the chart for better readability?\n3. Do you\
  \ prefer to display any additional summary statistics on the chart, such as mean\
  \ or standard deviation?\n4. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would\
  \ like to use for the chart?\n5. Do you have a preferred style for the whiskers\
  \ in the box plot (e.g., 1.5 IQR, minimum and maximum)?\n6. Would you like to highlight\
  \ or annotate any specific outliers or data points in the chart?\n7. Do you want\
  \ to include notches to represent confidence intervals for the median in the box\
  \ plots?\n8. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the chart?\n\
  9. Should we include a legend or additional annotations to provide more information\
  \ about the data? \n10. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for\
  \ the chart labels and titles?"
