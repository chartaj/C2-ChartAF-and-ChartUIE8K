initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing the gender wage gap over time for
  various countries. Each point in the scatter plot should represent a unique year
  of data, with the x-axis portraying the year and the y-axis showing the gender wage
  gap percentage. Different countries should be distinguishable via different colors
  or markers. This is to analyze trends and disparities in economic inequality over
  several decades to understand how the wage gap has evolved spatially and temporally.
  Please ensure the chart is labeled clearly with axes titles and a legend for different
  countries. Thanks!
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color palette used to distinguish\
  \ different countries?\n2. Would you like to set a specific range for the x-axis\
  \ (years) and y-axis (gender wage gap percentage)?\n3. Are there specific countries\
  \ you would like to highlight or focus on?\n4. Do you have a preferred font style\
  \ or size for the axis labels and legend?\n5. Would you like to include gridlines\
  \ on the chart for better readability?\n6. Should the legend be placed in a specific\
  \ position on the chart?\n7. Do you require markers to have a specific shape or\
  \ style for different countries? \n8. Do you want to include data point labels for\
  \ each data point on the chart?"
