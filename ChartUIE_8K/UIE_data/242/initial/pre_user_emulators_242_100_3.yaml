- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a scatter plot visualizing the gender wage gap over time for various countries.
  Each point in the scatter plot should represent a unique year of data, with the
  x-axis portraying the year and the y-axis showing the gender wage gap percentage.
  Different countries should be distinguishable via different colors or markers. This
  is to analyze trends and disparities in economic inequality over several decades
  to understand how the wage gap has evolved spatially and temporally. Please ensure
  the chart is labeled clearly with axes titles and a legend for different countries.
  Thanks!
