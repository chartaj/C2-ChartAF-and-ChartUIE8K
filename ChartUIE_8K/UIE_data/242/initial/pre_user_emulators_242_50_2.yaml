2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a dumbbell chart to visualize the gender wage gap (%) over the years for
  Brazil. Include data-driven text annotations to highlight key years and values.
  Use highlights to emphasize significant changes. The goal is to illustrate trends
  in gender economic inequality.
