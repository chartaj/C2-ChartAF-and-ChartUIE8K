initial_prompt: Create a dumbbell chart to visualize the gender wage gap percentages
  over time for Brazil. Use the data from 1981 to 1983, highlighting the changes and
  trends in gender wage gaps. Add text annotations on key data points to emphasize
  significant values. Use highlights to clearly distinguish each year's wage gap percentage,

  allowing viewers to quickly grasp the progression and magnitude of the wage gap.
