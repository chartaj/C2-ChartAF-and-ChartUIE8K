  the correlation?

  3. Would you like to include annotations or labels on the heatmap to denote correlation
  values?

  4. Is there a specific time interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) you prefer for
  aggregating the data?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges or time periods you would like to focus on
  or highlight?
