initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart to visualize the trading volume data over time
  for both oil and coal. Use the ''date'' column for the x-axis, and plot two lines:
  one for ''oil'' and one for ''coal'' values on the y-axis. Ensure each line is distinctly
  colored for clarity. The chart should cover the entire dataset, showing how the
  trading volumes for both commodities have fluctuated day-to-day. This will help
  in comparing trends between oil and coal from the given data. Add appropriate titles
  and labels to enhance the readability of the chart.'

  2. Would you like to include a subtitle for additional context? If so, what should
  it be?

  4. What labels would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should any particular date range be highlighted on the x-axis?

  7. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for either
  of the lines?

  8. Would you like to add markers to the data points on the lines for emphasis?

  9. How would you like outliers, if any, to be represented or addressed in the chart?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  (e.g., average value lines, significant events)?'
