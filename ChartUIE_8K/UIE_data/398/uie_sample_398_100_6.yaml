initial_prompt: 'I have trading volume data for oil and coal, including columns for
  date, oil, and coal volume. Can you create a histogram for me that visualizes the
  distribution of oil and coal trading volumes? I want to see if there are any particular
  trends in the volume distribution over a given period. It would be helpful to have
  this histogram based on the sample data provided: oil prices (135.98, 147.49, 146.93)
  and coal volumes (13560.077, 13434.653, 13318.875) over the dates (2013-04-28 to
  2013-04-30). Thanks!'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histograms representing
  oil and coal volumes?

  2. Would you like the histograms to be displayed side-by-side or overlaid on each
  other for easier comparison?

  3. Are there any particular axes labels or titles you would like to include in the
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer using specific bin widths for the histograms, or are you open to
  the default settings?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers to highlight
  specific points or trends in the data?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for colors.

  on the x-axis and "Frequency" on the y-axis.
