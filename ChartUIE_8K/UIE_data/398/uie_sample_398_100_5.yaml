initial_prompt: I need a heatmap visualizing the trading volume of oil and coal over
  the given date range. The x-axis should represent the dates, and the y-axis should
  represent the trading volumes for both oil and coal. The color intensity will indicate
  the volume levels, with darker shades representing higher trading volumes. Ensure
  the dates are appropriately formatted and evenly spaced to accurately reflect the
  timeline. The heatmap should make it easy to identify patterns or trends in trading
  volumes over time, highlighting any correlations or fluctuations between the two
  energy sources. Please include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What level of date granularity do you prefer (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  3. Are there specific date formats you would like to use for the x-axis labels?

  4. Do you want gridlines or tick marks along the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Should the y-axis display the exact trading volumes or use a logarithmic scale?

  6. Would you like the trading volumes for oil and coal to be shown side by side
  or overlaid?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for font styles or sizes for the axis labels
  and title?

  8. Are there any annotations or markers you would like to include to highlight specific
  dates or events?

  9. Do you have a preferred positioning for the legend?

  10. Would you like to include any specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?'
