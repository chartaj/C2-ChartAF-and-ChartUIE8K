initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the given data from the Data Science
  Job Salaries dataset. The chart should display the average salary in USD for different
  job titles. Make sure to categorize by experience level (e.g., MI, SE) and show
  the comparison across work years (e.g., 2020). This will help in visualizing which
  job roles are more lucrative over time and across different experience levels. The
  chart should be clear and easy to understand for someone in the business domain,
  possibly hiring managers or job seekers.

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between different experience
  levels?

  within each experience level category?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?
