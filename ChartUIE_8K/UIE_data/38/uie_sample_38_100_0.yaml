initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the salaries in USD over the work
  years for different job titles in data science. Highlight key positions like Data
  Scientist, Machine Learning Scientist, and Big Data Engineer to compare their salary
  trends. Add text annotations to highlight significant data points, such as the highest
  and lowest salaries for each role. The chart should help analyze salary progression
  over time for different experience levels and employment types while providing insights
  on remote work's impact. Use different colors for various job titles to improve
  clarity and make the chart visually appealing.

  7. Would you like to customize the axis labels and titles, and if so, any specific
  preferences?
