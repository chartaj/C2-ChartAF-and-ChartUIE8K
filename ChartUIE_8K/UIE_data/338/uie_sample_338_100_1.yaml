initial_prompt: Visualize the manufacturing dataset using a box chart to show variations
  in ProductionVolume, ProductionCost, and WorkerProductivity. Annotate key outliers
  and highlight minimum and maximum values for clarity. This will help identify trends
  and anomalies in production efficiency.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting minimum and maximum
  values?

  2. Should we use specific symbols or shapes to annotate the key outliers?

  3. Would you like the box chart to include a title and axis labels? If so, please
  provide the text for these labels.

  4. Do you prefer the data points for outliers to be labeled with their specific
  values?

  5. How detailed should the annotations for key outliers be (e.g., numerical value,
  additional context)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which the attributes (ProductionVolume,
  ProductionCost, WorkerProductivity) are displayed on the chart?

  7. Should the whiskers of the box chart represent the full range of data, or would
  you prefer a specific percentile (e.g., 1.5 times the interquartile range)?

  8. Would you like to display any additional statistical information such as mean
  or median values directly on the chart?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific preference for a color scheme.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include a title "Manufacturing Data Analysis" and axis labels "ProductionVolume",
  "ProductionCost", and "WorkerProductivity".

  4. Yes, please label the data points for outliers with their specific values.

  5. Just the numerical value should be fine.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would prefer the whiskers to represent 1.5 times the interquartile range.

  8. Yes, please display the median values directly on the chart.'
