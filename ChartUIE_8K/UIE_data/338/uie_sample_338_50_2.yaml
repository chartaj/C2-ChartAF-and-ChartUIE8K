initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing trends in ProductionVolume, DefectRate,
  and WorkerProductivity over time. Highlight periods with high defect rates. Add
  text annotations for significant spikes in downtime and worker productivity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for each line representing ''ProductionVolume'',
  ''DefectRate'', and ''WorkerProductivity''?

  2. How would you like the periods with high defect rates to be highlighted (e.g.,
  color change, shaded regions, markers)?

  3. How would you like significant spikes in downtime and worker productivity to
  be annotated (e.g., text boxes, tooltips)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the line chart (e.g., solid lines, dashed
  lines)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend on the chart (e.g.,
  top-right, bottom-center)?

  7. Are there any specific time intervals you would like to see on the x-axis (e.g.,
  daily, weekly, monthly)?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and annotations?

  9. Should the y-axis for ''DefectRate'' and ''WorkerProductivity'' share the same
  scale, or would you like them to have separate axes?'
