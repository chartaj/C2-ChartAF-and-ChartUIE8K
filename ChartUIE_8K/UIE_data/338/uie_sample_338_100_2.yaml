initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing key metrics over time with annotations
  emphasizing critical points. Include 'ProductionVolume', 'ProductionCost', and 'DefectRate'
  on the same chart. Use text annotations to highlight significant spikes or drops
  in production volume and cost, and to comment on defect rates, particularly noting
  any anomalies. Highlight these anomalies with different colors to make them stand
  out. The aim is to understand trends and identify areas for improving supply chain
  management efficiency and product quality in manufacturing. Contextualize the data
  within the manufacturing process to find actionable insights.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to highlight\
  \ anomalies?\n2. What time intervals (daily, monthly, quarterly, etc.) would you\
  \ like to be used on the x-axis? \n3. Are there specific labels or captions you\
  \ would like for the annotations on significant spikes or drops?\n4. Do you prefer\
  \ a particular font style or size for the annotations and labels?\n5. Would you\
  \ like gridlines to be included in the chart to help with reading values?\n6. Should\
  \ the y-axis be standardized, or do you prefer each metric to have its own y-axis?\n\
  7. Do you have a preference for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) or thickness\
  \ used for each metric?\n8. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If so, do\
  \ you have any specific format or placement preferences?\n9. Are there any additional\
  \ contextual elements you would like included in the chart (e.g., reference lines,\
  \ background shading for specific time periods)?\n10. Do you want to include any\
  \ specific introductory or concluding remarks on the chart to explain the data to\
  \ the audience?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Monthly would be fine.

  3. Significant spikes or drops can be labeled as "High Production Volume" or "Sudden
  Drop in Cost" etc.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful.

  6. The y-axis can be standardized.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, including a legend would be helpful. No specific format or placement preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
