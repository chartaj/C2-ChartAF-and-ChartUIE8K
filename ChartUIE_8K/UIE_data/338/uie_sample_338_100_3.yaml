initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between ProductionVolume
  and DefectRate from the manufacturing defects dataset. Each point should represent
  an observation, with the x-axis showing ProductionVolume and the y-axis showing
  DefectRate. Additionally, color-code the points based on the DefectStatus to differentiate
  between defective and non-defective items. Add trend lines if possible to show correlation.
  Make sure axes are labeled clearly and the chart has a legend. This will help in
  understanding how production volume might affect defect rates in the supply chain.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for points representing
  defective and non-defective items?

  2. Should the trend lines be linear or would you prefer a different type of fit
  (e.g., polynomial)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific markers or shapes for the data points?

  4. How would you like the trend lines to be distinguished (e.g., color, dashed lines)?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like to add to the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  8. Should the chart include annotations for any significant points or outliers?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement on the chart?

  10. Is there a specific background color you would like for the chart?'
