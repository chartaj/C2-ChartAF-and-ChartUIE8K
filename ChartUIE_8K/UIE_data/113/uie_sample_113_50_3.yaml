  3. Should a trend line be included on the scatter plot to highlight overall trends?

  4. Do you have a preference for the scale or range of the Y-axis (total alcohol
  consumption per capita)?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines for better readability of data points?

  6. Would you like to add labels to the data points, such as the name of each entity?

  7. Should the X-axis and Y-axis labels include units or additional context?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis titles and labels?

  9. Would you like to include a legend to explain different elements or categories
  within the scatter plot?
