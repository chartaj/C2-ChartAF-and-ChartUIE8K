2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap visualizing the total alcohol consumption per capita by country
  from 2010 to 2018. Use text annotations to highlight countries with the highest
  and lowest consumption, and include data-driven annotations for specific years of
  interest. Implement highlights to differentiate countries with missing data values
  by modifying their appearance. This visualization aims to emphasize global patterns
  in alcohol consumption and identify significant trends. Consider using color gradients
  to represent varying levels of consumption clearly. Contextualize the data to show
  its relevance to food and drink habits globally.
