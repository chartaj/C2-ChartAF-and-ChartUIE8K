initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the total alcohol consumption per capita
  by country from 2010 to 2018. Use text annotations to highlight countries with the
  highest and lowest consumption, and include data-driven annotations for specific
  years of interest. Implement highlights to differentiate countries with missing
  data values by modifying their appearance. This visualization aims to emphasize
  global patterns in alcohol consumption and identify significant trends. Consider
  using color gradients to represent varying levels of consumption clearly. Contextualize
  the data to show its relevance to food and drink habits globally.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing varying levels
  of alcohol consumption?

  2. Do you want the specific years of interest to be highlighted in a particular
  way?

  3. Is there a specific format or style for the text annotations you would like to
  use for the highest and lowest consumption countries?

  4. Do you have any preferences for how countries with missing data should be visually
  differentiated?

  5. Would you like to include any additional geographical or demographic context
  in the chart?'
