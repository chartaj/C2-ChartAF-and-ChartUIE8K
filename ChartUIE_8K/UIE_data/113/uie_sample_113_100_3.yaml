initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the "Total alcohol consumption
  per capita" over the years for each country. The x-axis should represent different
  years, and the y-axis should represent the "Total alcohol consumption per capita"
  in liters of pure alcohol. Use different colors to represent different countries,
  and include a legend to distinguish between them. Ensure that missing values are
  handled appropriately. This plot should help to identify trends in alcohol consumption
  across different regions over time. Provide labels and a title for clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different countries?

  2. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and title?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have grid lines for easier reading, and if so, what
  style or color do you prefer for the grid lines?

  4. Do you want data points to be connected with lines to better show the trends?

  5. How would you like missing values to be handled or represented on the chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style or position for the legend?

  7. Is there any particular title you would like for the scatter plot?

  8. Do you want any specific annotation or highlighting for certain countries or
  data points?'
