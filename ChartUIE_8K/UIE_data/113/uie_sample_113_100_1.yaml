initial_prompt: Create a line chart to show the trend of total alcohol consumption
  per capita over the years for different entities. Include text annotations to highlight
  significant changes or points in the data. Additionally, use highlights to emphasize
  specific entities or years, making important data points stand out visually. The
  data provides insights into alcohol consumption patterns and can be used for health
  and policy analysis. Ensure the visualization clearly differentiates various entities
  and shows year-by-year changes. Annotations should guide viewers to notable trends
  and outliers in the dataset for better understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting specific entities or years?

  2. What style of line (solid, dashed, dotted) would you prefer to distinguish different
  entities?

  3. Where would you like the text annotations to be placed in relation to the data
  points?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the annotations and labels?

  5. Should specific entities or years be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., using
  bold lines, different colors)?

  6. Is there a specific range for the y-axis that you''d like to set?

  7. Do you have preferences for the chart''s title, subtitle, and axis labels?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where do you prefer it to be positioned
  on the chart?

  9. Are gridlines or reference lines (horizontal or vertical) preferred for better
  readability of the chart?

  10. Do you require any specific data point markers (circles, squares, etc.) on the
  lines to emphasize individual data points?'
