initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the projected alcohol consumption per
  capita by country from 2010 to 2018. Annotate key data points and highlight countries
  with significant changes in consumption.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the heatmap?

  2. What type of annotation style do you prefer for key data points? (e.g., text
  labels, arrows)

  3. How should significant changes in consumption be highlighted? (e.g., different
  color shades, borders)

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color intensities on the heatmap?

  5. Do you want to display country names directly on the heatmap or use a tooltip
  on hover?

  6. Should the heatmap include gridlines to distinguish between different years and
  countries?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for the visualization (e.g., size, aspect ratio)?

  8. Would you like to incorporate any additional contextual information or annotations
  to provide more insights?

  9. Should there be any threshold for what constitutes a significant change in consumption,
  or should it be automatically calculated?'
