initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset here referencing three columns: x, y1, and y2, all
  containing float64 values with no missing data. I''d like to visualize this information
  as an area chart to see the trends and relationships between y1 and y2 over the
  values of x. Particularly, I am interested in identifying any patterns or differences
  between y1 and y2 as x changes. Please create an area chart that overlays y1 and
  y2, using x for the horizontal axis and differentiating y1 and y2 with distinct
  colors.'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating y1 and
  y2?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for easier comparison?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font or font size for the labels and title?

  4. How would you like the legend to be placed? (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)

  5. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  6. Should the axes be labeled with specific names other than ''x'', ''y1'', and
  ''y2''?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the chart? (e.g., minimalist, colorful,
  professional, etc.)

  8. Are there any particular tooltips or annotations you would like to include in
  the chart for better clarity?

  9. Do you have a preferred axis range for the x, y1, and y2 axes?

  10. Would you like the chart to include a trend line or any other statistical representation
  for better trend identification?'
