initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing columns x vs. y1 and y2. Use text
  annotations to highlight key data points, especially those with significant values,
  and use highlights to emphasize important patterns. This will help in analyzing
  trends and correlations in scientific research.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the bubble
  chart?

  2. Do you prefer the bubbles to be filled with solid colors or gradient colors?

  3. How would you like the sizes of the bubbles to be determined, based on which
  variable?

  4. Are there particular colors you want to use for highlighting important patterns?

  5. Which data points would you consider "key data points" that need text annotations?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for the text annotations (e.g., font size, font
  style)?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to explain the variables and highlights?

  9. Do you want to set specific axis ranges, or should they be automatically determined?

  10. Are there any specific thresholds for what you consider “significant values”
  that need to be highlighted?

  11. Would you like to include a title and labels for the axes? If so, what should
  they be?

  12. Do you prefer having a transparent background for the chart or a specific background
  color?'
