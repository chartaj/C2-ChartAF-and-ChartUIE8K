initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the data with 'x' on the x-axis and 'y1'
  and 'y2' on the y-axis. Ensure that 'y1' and 'y2' lines are different colors for
  clarity. Include annotations for key data points, particularly peaks and troughs,
  to highlight crucial information. Use highlights to distinguish between the two
  lines and make significant data points stand out. The purpose is to analyze trends
  over 'x' and compare 'y1' and 'y2' visually. This will help in understanding correlations
  and patterns effectively. Ensure the chart is clear and informative for data-driven
  decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing ''y1''
  and ''y2''?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for easier reading of values?

  3. Are there specific labels or titles you would like to include for the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of annotations for key data points (e.g.,
  arrows, circles)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between ''y1'' and ''y2''?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Would you like the peaks and troughs to be highlighted with specific symbols
  or just annotated?

  8. Should the chart display minor ticks along the axes, or are major ticks sufficient
  for your needs?

  9. Do you want to incorporate any trend lines or moving averages to further analyze
  trends over ''x''?

  10. Is there a specific data range or subset of ''x'' that you would like to focus
  on or zoom into on the chart?'
