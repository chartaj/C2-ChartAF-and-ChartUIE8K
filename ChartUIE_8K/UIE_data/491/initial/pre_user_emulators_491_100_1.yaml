  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart using the data with 'x' on the x-axis and 'y1' and 'y2' on the
  y-axis. Ensure that 'y1' and 'y2' lines are different colors for clarity. Include
  annotations for key data points, particularly peaks and troughs, to highlight crucial
  information. Use highlights to distinguish between the two lines and make significant
  data points stand out. The purpose is to analyze trends over 'x' and compare 'y1'
  and 'y2' visually. This will help in understanding correlations and patterns effectively.
  Ensure the chart is clear and informative for data-driven decision-making.
