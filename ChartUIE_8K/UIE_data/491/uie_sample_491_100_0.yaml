initial_prompt: Visualize a bubble chart using x, y1, and y2 data. The x-axis represents
  'x', while the y-axis shows 'y1' values with bubble size determined by 'y2'. Add
  data-driven text annotations to specific data points to highlight and draw attention
  to their values, emphasizing key trends or outliers. Use color and size highlights
  to distinguish between important elements and less significant ones. This visualization
  will help identify patterns and correlations in the data, making it easier to understand
  relationships between variables. Ensure annotations provide context and clarify
  insights obtained from the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubbles and background?

  2. Are there specific data points you want to be annotated?

  3. Should the bubbles representing important elements be highlighted in a particular
  way?

  4. Do you have preferences for the font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. How would you like the axis labels and title to be styled?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you want to use for bubble sizes?

  7. Do you have a preference for a legend format or placement?

  8. Should the bubbles be transparent to better view overlapping data points?

  9. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart, and if so, how should they
  be styled?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please annotate the highest and lowest ''y1'' values and any significant
  outliers.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, make the bubbles slightly transparent to better view overlapping data points.
