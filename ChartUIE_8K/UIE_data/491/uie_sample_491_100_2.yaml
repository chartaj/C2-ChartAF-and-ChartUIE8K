initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between the columns
  x, y1, and y2. Utilize text annotations to highlight significant data points with
  high correlation values. Use color gradients to differentiate varying intensities,
  making the relationships between the variables clear. This will provide a visual
  understanding of the data distribution and correlation, aiding in data-driven decision-making.
  Highlight specific areas of interest or anomalies for further investigation. Ensure
  the heatmap is easy to read and interpret, with appropriate labels and a clear legend.
  This visualization will be valuable in data science and analytics contexts.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?\n2. How would\
  \ you like significant data points with high correlation values to be highlighted\
  \ (e.g., bold text, different color)?\n3. Is there a specific threshold for correlation\
  \ values that should be considered significant?\n4. Do you have any preferences\
  \ for the size or orientation of the text annotations?\n5. Would you like to include\
  \ specific grid sizes or intervals for the heatmap?\n6. Are there any particular\
  \ areas of interest or known anomalies we should focus on? \n7. Would you prefer\
  \ the labels and legend to be in a specific position or format?\n8. Do you have\
  \ any preferences for the scale used in the color gradient (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?\n\
  9. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the labels and\
  \ annotations?\n10. Is there a preferred resolution or aspect ratio for the heatmap?"
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. Bold text would be great for highlighting significant data points with high correlation
  values.

  3. I am not sure about a specific threshold for correlation values.

  4. I don''t have any specific preferences for the size or orientation of the text
  annotations.

  5. I do not know about grid sizes or intervals for the heatmap.

  6. I do not have any particular areas of interest or known anomalies.

  7. I have no specific preference for the labels and legend position or format.

  8. I am not sure about the scale used in the color gradient.

  9. No specific fonts or styles for the labels and annotations.

  10. I have no preference for resolution or aspect ratio for the heatmap.
