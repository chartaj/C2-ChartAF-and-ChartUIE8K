  4. Do you prefer the annotation to be inside the cells, or should they be outside
  with arrows pointing to the extreme values?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the correlation values?

  7. Do you want grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  8. Would you like the correlation values to be displayed within each cell of the
  heatmap?

  9. Do you have any preference on the orientation (horizontal or vertical) for the
  heatmap labels?

  10. Are there any specific title or labels you would like to include on the chart?'
