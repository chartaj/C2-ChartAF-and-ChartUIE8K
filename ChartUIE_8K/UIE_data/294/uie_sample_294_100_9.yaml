initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize Ronaldo's Tweets Insight
  ðŸ“Š data. Each bubble should represent a tweet, where the x-axis is 'createdAt', the
  y-axis is 'likeCount', and the size of the bubble corresponds to 'retweetCount'.
  Additionally, color-code the bubbles based on 'quoteCount'. Make sure to include
  labels and a legend for clarity. This will help in identifying trends and high-engagement
  tweets over time. Thank you!

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis be displayed with labels and ticks for specific
  intervals?

  4. Do you have any preference for the shape of the bubbles (e.g., circles, squares)?

  5. Should the chart have a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind?

  6. Do you want any specific formatting for the date on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart
  (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  over each bubble?
