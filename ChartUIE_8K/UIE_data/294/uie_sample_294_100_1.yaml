initial_prompt: Create a radial bar chart visualizing engagement metrics (retweets,
  replies, likes, quotes, bookmarks) for Ronaldo's Tweets, highlighting the most engaging
  tweets. Include data-driven text annotations for each bar to show exact counts and
  make comparisons clear. Highlight tweets with exceptionally high engagement for
  emphasis. Add textual annotations to provide context on specific events or collaborations
  mentioned in the tweets. Use different colors to represent each type of engagement
  metric. The visualization should help identify trends in Ronaldo's social media
  impact and the effectiveness of different types of tweet content.
