initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing engagement across Ronaldo's tweets.
  Use sectors for retweets, replies, likes, quotes, and bookmarks. Add text annotations
  highlighting peak engagement counts. Enhance sectors with color highlights to emphasize
  varying engagement levels. This visualization should reveal trends and help pinpoint
  which types of interactions (retweets, likes, etc.) dominate. The chart should provide
  a clear snapshot of overall engagement, making it easy to compare different metrics
  at a glance. Use data from provided example, focusing on clarity and engagement
  insights presented in a visually appealing manner.

  different engagement metrics?
