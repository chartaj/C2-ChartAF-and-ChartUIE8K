initial_prompt: Create a box chart for Ronaldo's tweet engagement metrics. Use retweetCount,
  replyCount, likeCount, quoteCount, and bookmarkCount. The box chart should show
  the distribution of engagement for each metric, highlighting median, quartiles,
  and any potential outliers. Ensure each metric is clearly labeled for easy comparison.
  This way, we can visualize the variability and central tendencies of how Ronaldo's
  tweets perform in terms of public interaction. Include data labels for key points
  to enhance interpretability.
