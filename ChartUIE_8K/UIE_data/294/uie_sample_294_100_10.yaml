initial_prompt: 'Please create a dot plot to visualize the engagement metrics of Ronaldo''s
  tweets. Use ''retweetCount'', ''replyCount'', ''likeCount'', ''quoteCount'', and
  ''bookmarkCount'' against the ''createdAt'' column to show trends over time. Each
  dot should represent a tweet with different colors for each metric. Make sure to
  highlight the dates and significant spikes in engagement. Add a legend to differentiate
