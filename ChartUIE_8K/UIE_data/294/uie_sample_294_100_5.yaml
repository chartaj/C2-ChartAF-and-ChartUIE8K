initial_prompt: I need a Sunburst chart for Ronaldo's tweet data. The chart should
  visualize engagement metrics (retweets, replies, likes, quotes, bookmarks) by tweet.
  Use 'createdAt' as the outer ring, splitting by months and weeks. Inside, categorize
  by 'text' and then show each engagement type as inner rings. This will help to easily
  identify the engagement trends and compare different tweets' popularity and interaction
  levels over time. Please use color coding for different engagement metrics for better
  visualization and clarity. The summary and sample data provided should guide the
  chart structure.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the different engagement
  metrics?

  2. Are there any specific fonts you prefer for the labels and text on the chart?

  3. Would you like to display the exact engagement numbers or percentages in the
  chart?

  4. Is there a particular ordering you would like for the engagement metrics in the
  inner rings?

  5. Do you want to include any annotations or notes on the chart for specific tweets
  or time periods?

  6. Are there any specific size constraints for the chart?

  7. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color codes and engagement metrics?

  8. Do you want the chart to include tooltips that provide additional details when
  hovering over specific sections?

  9. Is there a preferred date format for the ''createdAt'' labels on the chart?

  10. Do you have any preference for the thickness of the rings in the sunburst chart?

  11. Would you like to highlight any specific tweets or time periods in the chart
  for emphasis?'
