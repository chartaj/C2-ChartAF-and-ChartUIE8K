initial_prompt: Create an area chart to illustrate engagement trends over time for
  Ronaldo's tweets. Utilize the 'createdAt' field along the x-axis and plot 'retweetCount',
  'replyCount', 'likeCount', 'quoteCount', and 'bookmarkCount' on the y-axis. Show
  each metric in a different color to identify patterns and peaks easily. This will
  help visualize how engagement metrics compare across different tweets and pinpoint
  any major spikes in activity. The aim is to gain insights into which tweets garnered
  the most attention and when. Use the latest three tweets from the sample data as
  examples.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for each engagement metric?

  2. Should the x-axis show specific time intervals (e.g., days, weeks, months)?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on both axes?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart titles and labels?

  5. Should there be a legend indicating which color corresponds to each engagement
  metric?

  6. Do you wish to include data markers for specific points on the area chart?

  7. Do you want to add annotations or highlights for any significant spikes or patterns?

  8. Should the chart include tooltips for detailed data on hover for each data point?

  9. Would you like the area chart to have a smooth or stepped fill between points?'
