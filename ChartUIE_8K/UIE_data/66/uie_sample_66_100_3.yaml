initial_prompt: I want a heatmap showing the correlation between different features
  in the consumer electronics sales dataset. Use variables like CustomerSatisfaction,
  PurchaseFrequency, ProductPrice, and PurchaseIntent to see how they relate to each
  other. The heatmap should highlight areas with strong correlations, helping identify
  patterns in customer behavior and sales trends. Use different shades of colors to
  denote the intensity of the correlations for clear visual insights. Make sure the
  chart is easy to interpret and includes a legend for reference. This will help us
  understand the impact of various factors on sales. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display numerical correlation values on the cells?

  3. Is there a specific color you want to use for strong positive or strong negative
  correlations?

  4. Do you want axis labels to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. Should the heatmap include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific ordering of the variables you prefer on the axes?

  7. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)
  on the chart?

  8. Do you want to highlight specific ranges of correlation values with distinct
  colors or symbols?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to be included
  on the heatmap?'
