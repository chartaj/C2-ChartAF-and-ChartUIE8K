initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of Product Categories
  (Smartphones, Smart Watches, Tablets, etc.) from the consumer electronics dataset.
  Use data-driven text annotations to highlight the percentage share of each category
  in the total sales. The goal is to understand which categories dominate sales and
  which are less popular. Highlight sections to emphasize trends or notable insights
  like the most sold and least sold categories. This will help in strategizing which
  products to focus on for marketing and inventory management. Make sure the chart
  is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like specific labels for each category slice, or just percentage shares?

  3. How would you like the highlighted sections (for most sold and least sold categories)
  to be emphasized? For example, through color, size, or outline?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Do you want any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. Is there a preferred order for the categoriesâ€”alphabetical, by sales percentage,
  or another order?

  7. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information or notes on the chart?'
