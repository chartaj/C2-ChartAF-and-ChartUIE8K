  4. Do you have a preferred method for scaling or normalizing the data before plotting
  the heatmap?

  5. Are there any particular grid line styles or thicknesses you prefer for the heatmap?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the heatmap?

  7. Should we use a specific range for the color intensity to highlight strong correlations?'
