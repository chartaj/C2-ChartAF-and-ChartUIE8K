initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualizing the distribution of Bitcoin prices
  (priceUSD) from 9th-Apr-2014 to 30th-Dec-2022. Include the data on active addresses
  (activeaddresses) and median transaction fee (median_transaction_fee) in additional

  6. Do you need any specific annotations or markers on the charts to highlight particular
  data points or trends?

  7. Should the chart include grid lines or any specific background elements for better
  readability?

  8. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the axes or overall
