initial_prompt: I have Bitcoin data ranging from April 9, 2014, to December 30, 2022,
  and I'd like a scatter plot. Can you create a scatter plot showing the relationship
  between "priceUSD" and "transactions" over time? Use the "Date" attribute for the
  x-axis, and plot "priceUSD" and "transactions" on two y-axes. Please make sure to
  differentiate the two y-axes clearly and include a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the scatter plot points or lines
  for each y-axis?

  2. Would you like specific markers or shapes for the data points on the scatter
  plot?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  5. Do you wish to include gridlines on the chart? If so, any specific style or color
  for them?

  6. Would you like to annotate any particular data points or trends on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific date intervals you would like highlighted (e.g., monthly,
  quarterly, yearly)?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend placement on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  9. Should we include tick marks and labels for both y-axes, and do you have a preference
  for their frequency?'
