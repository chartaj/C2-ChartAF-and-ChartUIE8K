initial_prompt: Let's create a pie chart visualizing the 'priceUSD', 'size', and 'transactions'
  data from April 9th-11th, 2014. Highlight the differences in the segments, showing
  daily variations. Add text annotations to display the 'median_transaction_fee' values
  for each date, enhancing the insight into transaction costs. This visualization
  will help us understand the distribution and trends over the given days. If possible,
  include context information about Bitcoin's marketcap and mining profitability over
  the same period to enrich our analysis and engagement with the cryptocurrency data.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for differentiating the segments
  in the pie chart?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations for ''median_transaction_fee'' to be
  displayedâ€”inside or outside the pie segments?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order of the segments (e.g., by size, priceUSD,
  or transactions)?

  5. Would you like the pie chart to include a legend to explain each segment?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for the context information about
