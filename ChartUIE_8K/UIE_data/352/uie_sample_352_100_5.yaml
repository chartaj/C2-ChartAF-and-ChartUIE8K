initial_prompt: I have a dataset about Virtual Reality experiences with details like
  Age, Gender, VRHeadset, Duration, Motion Sickness, and Immersion Level. I would
  like a stacked bar chart that shows the distribution of VRHeadset usage across different
  age groups, with each section of the bars representing different Genders. This visualization
  will help to compare the preference of various VR headsets among different age groups
  and analyze gender differences in these preferences. Ensure the axes are labeled
  clearly and a legend is included for the VRHeadsets and Genders.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. How would you prefer the age groups to be categorized or segmented?

  3. Is there any specific order you would like the VR headsets to be displayed in
  the legend?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like any annotations or data labels on the bars themselves?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the layout of the legend (e.g., side, bottom)?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer the age groups to be categorized in decades (e.g., 10-19, 20-29,
  30-39, etc.).

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Distribution of VR Headset Usage Across Age Groups.'
