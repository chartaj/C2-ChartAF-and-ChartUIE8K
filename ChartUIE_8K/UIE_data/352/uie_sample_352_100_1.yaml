initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the relationship between 'Age' and
  'Duration' of VR usage, with 'Gender' differentiated by line color or style. Use
  text annotations to highlight the peak and lowest 'Duration' values and points where
  'MotionSickness' is 8. Emphasize differences in 'ImmersionLevel' using varied line
  thickness for distinct insight. Ensure the visual draws clear attention to age-related
  trends in VR experience duration, offering insights into demographic usage patterns
  and user well-being. This chart should reflect the detailed context of virtual reality
  experiences effectively. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors or styles for differentiating ''Gender''
  in the line chart?

  2. How would you like text annotations to be formatted? (e.g., font size, color,
  position)

  3. Do you have specific preferences for how the peak and lowest ''Duration'' values
  should be highlighted?

  4. How would you like the points where ''MotionSickness'' is 8 to be represented?

  5. What thickness levels should be used to differentiate varying ''ImmersionLevel''?

  6. Are there any specific age-related trends or patterns that you want to be more
  prominently emphasized?

  7. Would you like any additional labels or legends to be included in the chart for
  clarity?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or design of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t know.

  3. The peak and lowest ''Duration'' values should be highlighted with larger text
  and maybe a different color, like red.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Emphasize any sharp increases or decreases in ''Duration'' around specific age
  groups.

  7. Yes, please include a legend that explains color/style for gender and line thickness
  for ''ImmersionLevel''.

  8. I do not have any specific preference for the overall layout or design.'
