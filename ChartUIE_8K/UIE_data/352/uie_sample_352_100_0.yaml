initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the Virtual Reality Experiences
  data. Plot 'Duration' on the x-axis and 'MotionSickness' on the y-axis, with points
  differentiated by 'VRHeadset'. Use text annotations to highlight three data points
  that represent unusual combinations of high 'Duration' and low 'MotionSickness'.
  Additionally, use highlights to emphasize data points with the highest 'ImmersionLevel'.
  This will help in understanding the correlation between usage duration, motion sickness,
  and immersiveness across different VR headsets. The plot aims to aid in analyzing
  user experiences and the effectiveness of various VR headsets.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different ''VRHeadset''
  categories?

  2. What specific color would you like to use for highlighting the data points with
  the highest ''ImmersionLevel''?

  3. Would you prefer a particular style or format for the text annotations?

  4. Is there a specific size you would like the scatter plot to be?

  5. Do you have any preference for the shape of the data points (e.g., circles, squares)?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot? If so, in what
  style?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for labels and annotations?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like to include axis labels or a legend? If so, any specific format
  or style?

  10. Are there any specific markers or lines you would like to use to delineate high
  ''Duration'' and low ''MotionSickness'' combinations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, grid lines with a light dashed style would be great.

  7. I have no specific preference for font type and size.
