initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of user ages
  and the duration of virtual reality experiences. The data comes from a study on
  virtual reality, showing various demographics and their experiences with different
  VR headsets. Display the age distribution on one axis and frequency on the other.
  Additionally, include a histogram for the duration of VR sessions, showing how long
  users typically engage in virtual reality activities. This will help us understand
  the typical age of VR users and how long they usually spend in a session. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histograms?

  2. Should the age and duration histograms be presented in separate plots or combined
  in a single figure?

  3. What bin size or range would you prefer for the histograms?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the histograms?

  5. Do you have a preference for the visual style of the histograms (e.g., bar width,
  border style, transparency)?

  6. Would you like the histograms to include mean or median lines?

  7. Is there any additional metadata or context youâ€™d like to be included in the
  visualization (e.g., title, legend, axis labels)?

  8. Should data for different VR headsets be distinguished in any way, such as color-coding
  or separate histograms?'
