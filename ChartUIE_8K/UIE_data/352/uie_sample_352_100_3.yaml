initial_prompt: I need a heatmap showing the relationship between different factors
  in VR experiences. Specifically, I want to see how Age, Gender, and VRHeadset types
  correlate with Duration, MotionSickness, and ImmersionLevel. Use color gradients
  to indicate the intensity of these relationships. Make sure to include labels for
  all the axes and a legend explaining the colors used. The data comes from a study
  on virtual reality, so accuracy in representing these relationships is crucial for
  understanding user experiences and potential areas for improvement in VR headsets
  and applications.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for indicating the
  intensity of relationships?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  3. Do you want any specific ordering for the categories, such as Age groups or VRHeadset
  types?

  4. Should the heatmap include gridlines or any specific styling for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or highlights on the heatmap?'
