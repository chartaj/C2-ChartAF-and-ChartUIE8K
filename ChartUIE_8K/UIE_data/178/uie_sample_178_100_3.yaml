initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 highest grossing movies
  from the dataset. The y-axis should represent the movie titles and the x-axis should
  represent the worldwide sales in dollars. Include the release year next to each
  movie title. Use different colors for each bar to enhance visual distinction. Include
  appropriate labels for the axes and a legend for the color coding. This will help
  illustrate the distribution of the top earning movies over the years and their corresponding
  revenue performance. The dataset details should help ensure relevant and accurate
  representation.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the bars?

  2. What font style or size preferences do you have for the axis labels and titles?

  3. Would you prefer any specific type of gridlines (dotted, solid) or background
  for the chart?

  4. Should the legend display be positioned in a particular area of the chart (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order of the bars (ascending or descending based
  on revenue, release year, etc.)?'
