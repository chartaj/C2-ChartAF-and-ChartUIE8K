initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showcasing the top 10 highest-grossing
  movies based on their Domestic Sales, International Sales, and World Wide Sales.
  Highlight the Domestic Sales portion to emphasize its contribution to total sales.
  Use data-driven text annotations to display the exact sales figures on the bars
  to draw attention to the top-performing regions. The chart should help compare the
  financial success of different movies across regions, focusing on the importance
  of the domestic market versus international appeal. And include gen reset on x-axis
  to show diversification in movie genres.

  Sales portion?

  and World Wide Sales?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to use for the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  7. Do you want to include a title for the overall chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Should there be any emphasis on certain genres through different colors or markers?

  9. Do you need grid lines on the chart for better readability of the sales figures?
