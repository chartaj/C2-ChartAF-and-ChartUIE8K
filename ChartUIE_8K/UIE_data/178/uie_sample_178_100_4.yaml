initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing the distribution of top 1000 highest-grossing
  movies worldwide. Use the `Distributor` column to represent different regions, with
  colors indicating the total `World Wide Sales (in $)` per distributor. Ensure the
  map has appropriate legends and color gradients to distinguish high and low sales
  areas. Include tooltips to display details like `Title`, `Year`, and `Sales` when
