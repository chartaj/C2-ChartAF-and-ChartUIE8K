initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of budgets for the top
  1000 highest-grossing movies. Clearly highlight and annotate the movies with the
  highest and lowest budgets to draw attention to these outliers. The chart should
  help in understanding how budget allocations vary among these top-performing films.
  This visualization can provide insights into the relationship between budget and
  movie success, aiding in financial planning and resource allocation for future film
  projects.
