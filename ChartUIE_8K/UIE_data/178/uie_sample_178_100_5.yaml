initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the top 1000 highest-grossing movies.
  Plot "World Wide Sales (in $)" on the X-axis and "Year" on the Y-axis. Use bubble
  size to indicate "Budget (in $)" and color to represent "Genre". Ensure each bubble
  is labeled with the "Title" of the movie. This chart should help identify trends
  over time, budget impacts, and genre distribution among the top-grossing films.
  Please refine the data, handling missing values appropriately, to ensure accurate
  and insightful visualization.

  genres?

  on the bubbles?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the positioning of the legend on the chart?

  5. Should the axis labels and titles be bold or italicized for emphasis?

  6. Is there a particular chart title or subtitle you would like to include?

  7. Do you prefer a specific range or scale for the axes, especially the X-axis (World
  Wide Sales) and Y-axis (Year)?

  8. Are there any particular genres you would like to highlight or differentiate
  more prominently in the chart?

  9. Do you have a preference for the shape of the bubbles (e.g., perfect circles,

  10. Should the chart include tooltips or annotations for additional details when
  hovering over the bubbles?'
