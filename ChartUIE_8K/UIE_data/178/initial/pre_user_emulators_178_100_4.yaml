  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Choropleth map that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Choropleth map
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map showing the distribution of top 1000 highest-grossing movies
  worldwide. Use the `Distributor` column to represent different regions, with colors
  indicating the total `World Wide Sales (in $)` per distributor. Ensure the map has
  appropriate legends and color gradients to distinguish high and low sales areas.
  Include tooltips to display details like `Title`, `Year`, and `Sales` when hovering
  over each region. This visualization will help identify which distributors dominate
  the global box office market. Make sure the map is interactive for better user engagement
  and insight exploration.
