initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize different aspects of car attributes
  from the given data. Focus on key numerical columns such as wheelbase, carlength,
  carwidth, carheight, curbweight, enginesize, horsepower, citympg, highwaympg, and
  price. Each numerical column should have its own box plot to show the spread and
  outliers in the data. This will help identify variations in car prices and attributes
  for better insights. Make sure each box represents data distribution and highlight
  any outliers clearly for analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box plots?

  2. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier readability?

  3. How would you like outliers to be highlighted? (e.g., different color, shape,
  or size)

  4. Do you prefer the box plots to be oriented vertically or horizontally?

  5. Would you like to add labels or annotations for specific outliers or key points
  in the data?

  6. Do you want a legend to describe the various elements in the chart, such as outliers
  and whiskers?

  7. Would you like to display the mean or median values explicitly on the box plots?

  8. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the axis titles and labels?

  9. Should the chart have a title or subtitle for better context? If so, what should
  it be?

  10. Do you require any specific range limits for the axes to better focus on particular
  data segments?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, grid lines would be helpful for readability.

  3. Outliers can be highlighted with a different color.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, adding labels for specific outliers would be useful.

  6. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, please add a title: "Box Plot of Car Attributes" and a subtitle: "Analysis
  of Spread and Outliers".
