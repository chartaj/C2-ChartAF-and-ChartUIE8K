initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the price distribution across
  different car bodies from the provided automobile data. The chart should include
  annotations displaying the average price for each car body type. Please highlight
  the car body types that have significantly higher or lower average prices compared
  to others to make it easier to identify trends. This visualization will help in
  understanding the relationship between car body types and their pricing, which is
  crucial for our car price prediction analysis. Ensure the chart is clear and focused
  on these aspects.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different car body types?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the colors used for each
  car body type?

  3. Do you want to set a specific threshold to highlight car body types with significantly
  higher or lower average prices, or should we determine this automatically?

  4. Do you have a preferred format for the annotations displaying the average prices
  for each car body type?

  5. Would you like the bars to be ordered by the car body types, or by the average
  price in ascending or descending order?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels in the chart?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Would you prefer to display exact price values on the chart or just the relative
  comparison?

  9. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or units for the price data?'
