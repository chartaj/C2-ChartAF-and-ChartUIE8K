initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization using the car dataset. Highlight unique
  values in the 'carbody', 'fueltype', and 'drivewheel' columns, using distinct colors
  to emphasize different categories. Include text annotations to display values like
  'price', 'horsepower', and 'citympg' within the treemap boxes to draw attention
  to performance and cost metrics. This visualization will help in identifying trends
  and comparing car attributes with respect to their prices and fuel efficiency. The
  purpose is to make informed decisions on car selection based on various performance
  parameters and body types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  categories within ''carbody'', ''fueltype'', and ''drivewheel''?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for ''price'', ''horsepower'', and ''citympg''
  to be formatted (e.g., font size, font style, color)?

  3. Do you prefer any particular layout style for the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-and-dice)?

  4. Should there be a legend included to explain the color coding and categories?

  5. Do you have any preference for the hierarchy or nesting order of the categories
  within the treemap?

  6. Would you like to see any particular statistical summaries or key findings highlighted
  in the treemap?

  7. Are there any other attributes from the dataset you would like to include in
  the visualization?

  8. How much detail do you want in the text annotations for the ''price'', ''horsepower'',
  and ''citympg'' (e.g., all values, only certain thresholds, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer a legible font size, perhaps bold style, and colors that contrast
  well with the background.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding and categories.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Include all values for ''price'', ''horsepower'', and ''citympg'' for now.'
