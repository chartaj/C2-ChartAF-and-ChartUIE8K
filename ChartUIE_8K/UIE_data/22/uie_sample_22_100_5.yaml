initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  engine size and car price from the given automobile dataset. On the x-axis, plot
  the 'enginesize', and on the y-axis, plot the 'price'. Differentiate the points
  by 'carbody' type using different colors. This is for a car price prediction project
  using multiple linear regression analysis, so the visualization should help us understand
  how engine size influences the price across different types of car bodies. Make
  sure to label the axes and include a legend for the 'carbody' types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color palette to differentiate
  the ''carbody'' types?

  2. What title would you like to have for the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font type or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the scatter plot include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want set for the x-axis (engine size)
  or y-axis (price)?

  6. Would you like data points to be labeled with additional information such as
  ''CarName''?

  7. Do you want trend lines or lines of best fit to be included in the scatter plot?

  8. Is there a preferred style for the markers (circles, squares, etc.) on the scatter
  plot?

  9. Do you have any preference for the size of the markers?

  10. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?'
