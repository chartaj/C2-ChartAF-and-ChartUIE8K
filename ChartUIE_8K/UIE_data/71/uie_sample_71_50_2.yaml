initial_prompt: Create a tile map visualizing higher education institutions across
  the USA, highlighting different regions. Annotate unique details like the institution's
  name and category. Emphasize regions with the most institutions. Use these annotations
  efficiently to provide clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different regions?

  2. Would you like the institutions to be categorized by type using colors, icons,
  or both?

  3. How detailed should the annotations be for each institution (e.g., just name
  and category, or include the URL as well)?

  4. Are there specific regions you want to prioritize or emphasize more than others?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size of the tiles representing each institution
  or region?

  6. Should the tile map include a legend or key to explain the symbols and colors
  used?

  7. Do you want to see any particular labels or markers for regions with the highest
  concentration of institutions?

  8. Would you prefer the map to be laid out in a specific way, such as geographically
  accurate or in a grid layout?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or text styles you prefer for annotations and labels?

  10. Do you want to segregate the institutions by public and private categories specifically,
  and if so, how should this be reflected visually?'
