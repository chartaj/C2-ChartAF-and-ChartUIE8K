initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of higher education
  institutions across different regions in the USA. The data should utilize the `region`
  and `category` columns to show how many public and private institutions exist in
  each region. Ensure the color gradient reflects the density of institutions in each
  category and region. Include appropriate labels and a legend to make the heatmap
  easily interpretable. Use the data provided in the 71.csv file, which includes columns
  like `id`, `region`, `name`, `category`, and `url`. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient or color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific regions or categories to be highlighted or emphasized?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the heatmap include any specific title or subtitle?

  5. Do you want the heatmap to display the actual count of institutions within each
  cell, or is the color gradient sufficient?

  6. Are there any particular regions or categories that you want to appear in a specific
  order?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or descriptive text to be included
  in the heatmap?

  8. Is there any preference for the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?

  9. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  10. Are there any other specific visual elements you want to include or avoid in
  the heatmap?'
