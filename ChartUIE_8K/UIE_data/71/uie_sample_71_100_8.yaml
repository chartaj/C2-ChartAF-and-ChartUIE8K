initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the number of higher education
  institutions by region in the USA. We have data on various institutions including
  their ids, regions, names, categories, and URLs. I want to see trends over different
  regions to understand regional distribution. The x-axis should represent the regions,
  and the y-axis should represent the count of institutions. If possible, differentiate
  between private and public categories with different lines or colors. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  private and public categories?

  2. Would you prefer a specific ordering of the regions on the x-axis?

  3. Should the chart include data labels or tooltips to display exact counts of institutions
  for each region?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to clearly indicate which line or color represents
  private and which represents public institutions?

  5. Are there any specific regions you would like to highlight or focus on more prominently?

  6. Do you want any additional annotations or markers on the chart to highlight key
  insights or trends?'
