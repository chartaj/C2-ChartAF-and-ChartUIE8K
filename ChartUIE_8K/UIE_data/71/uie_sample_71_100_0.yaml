initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of higher education institutions
  across different regions in the USA. Use color highlights to distinguish between
  the 'Private' and 'Public' categories. Annotate bars representing 'Texas' and 'California'
  with their respective institution names to emphasize regional distribution. Include
  total counts and unique URLs for added context. This chart will help quickly understand
  the concentration and diversity of educational institutions by region, aiding in
  geographic and institutional comparison.

  and ''Public'' categories?

  a separate legend?

  5. How would you like the unique URLs presented: as tooltips on hover, or directly
  on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you want used for labels, annotations,
  and titles?'
