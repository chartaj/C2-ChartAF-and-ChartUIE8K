initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing higher education institutions in
  the USA, categorizing them into regions and highlighting the proportion belonging
  to each region. Use annotations to display institution names and websites for highlighted
  regions, focusing on distinct elements such as 'Texas' and 'California'. This will
  help in easily identifying and comparing the distribution and specifics of private
  institutions across different regions. Ensure the visual emphasizes Texas and California
  to draw attention to these particular areas.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the donut chart, especially
  for highlighting Texas and California?

  2. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the annotations displaying
  institution names and websites?

  4. Would you like to include any additional data or metrics in the chart, such as
  the total number of institutions per region?

  5. How many regions, apart from Texas and California, would you like to highlight
  in the annotations?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout or design of the chart to
  ensure it meets the needs of your audience?

  chart?'
