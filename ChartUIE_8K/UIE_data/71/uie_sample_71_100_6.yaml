initial_prompt: I want to visualize data from the Higher Education Institutions in
  the USA dataset. Please create a scatter plot showing each institution using the
  'id' on the x-axis and distinct regions on the y-axis. Mark points differently based
  on the 'category' of the institution (e.g., Private vs. Public). Ensure that each
  marker also includes a tooltip or label with the institution's 'name' and 'url'
  to provide contextual information. Highlight any outliers or unusual data points
  if present. This will help me understand the geographic distribution and category
  distinctions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific regions or states you want to highlight in
  the chart?

  2. Are there any preferred colors or color schemes you would like us to use for
  different categories (e.g., Private vs. Public)?

  3. How would you like the tooltip or label to be formatted? Should it include both
  ''name'' and ''url'', or any additional information?

  4. Would you prefer markers to be in specific shapes for different categories (e.g.,
  circles for Private, squares for Public)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for highlighting outliers or unusual data
  points (e.g., different color, larger size)?

  6. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the scatter plot to adhere
  to (e.g., professional, academic, casual)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. It should include both ''name'' and ''url''.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.
