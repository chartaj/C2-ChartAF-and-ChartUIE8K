initial_prompt: Create a Spline chart to visualize the stock performance from the
  given dataset. Plot 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' on the y-axis. Also, include
  another spline for 'Perc_Change' to reflect the percentage change in stock price
  over time. Make sure both lines are clearly distinguishable with proper labels and
  legends. Use different colors to differentiate between the 'Close' and 'Perc_Change'
  series. Add data points for better readability. Keep the chart interactive to allow
  zooming and tooltips for detailed information.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate
  between the ''Close'' and ''Perc_Change'' series?

  2. Would you like to customize the style of the data points? If so, do you have
  any specific preferences?

  3. Do you have any particular font style or size preferences for the labels and
  legends?

  4. Would you like to see gridlines in the background of the chart? If yes, should
  they be in a specific style or color?

  5. Would you prefer a specific thickness for the spline lines to enhance visibility?

  6. Should there be a specific format for displaying dates on the x-axis, like month-year
  or day-month-year?

  7. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  8. Are there any specific ranges or intervals you would like for the x-axis (Date)
  or y-axis (''Close'', ''Perc_Change'')?

  9. Would you like to include annotations or markers for any specific events or data
  points on the chart?

  10. Should the chart include a title? If yes, please specify the title text and
  if there are any specific styling preferences.'
