initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of forest area
  proportions relative to the total land area for different countries in 2020. Highlight
  major deforestation trends from 2015-2020.
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram and trends? \n2.\
  \ Do you have a preferred bin size for the histogram?\n3. Should the histogram include\
  \ labels for the x and y axes? If so, what should they be?\n4. Would you like to\
  \ include a title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?\n5. Do you want to emphasize\
  \ specific countries in the histogram? If yes, which ones?\n6. Should the histogram\
  \ include a legend or annotation for deforestation trends from 2015-2020?\n7. Do\
  \ you prefer the histogram bars to be separated or adjacent?\n8. Is there a specific\
  \ font style or size you would prefer for the text in the chart?\n9. Do you want\
  \ gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?\n10. Should the\
  \ data for deforestation trends be represented using a different marker or line\
  \ style?"
