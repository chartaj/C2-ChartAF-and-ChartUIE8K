initial_prompt: 'I want a line chart displaying the forest area changes for different
  countries from 1990 to 2020. Use the data from the provided file, highlighting three
  countries as sample points: Afghanistan, Albania, and a global overview (WORLD).
  Make separate lines for each year (1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020). Include forest
  area affected by fire and deforestation percentages when hovered over each point.
  The overall title should be "Global Forest Insights 1990-2020" with axes for years
  and forest area.'
