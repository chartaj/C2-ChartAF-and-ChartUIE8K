initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using data from "../Extra_datas/data/95.csv,"
  showing the "Forest Area as a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020" for each country.
  The chart should compare "Forest Area as a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020"
  values across different countries. Specifically, I want to see how much of each
  country's land is covered by forests in 2020. Ensure the countries are listed along
  the x-axis, and the proportion of forest area is displayed on the y-axis. Use distinct
  colors for each country to enhance readability. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you''d like
  to use for the countries?

  2. Would you like the countries to be sorted in any particular order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by forest area proportion)?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier reading of values?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scale, such as starting from 0%?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like to add any specific labels or annotations to the chart?

  7. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  9. Do you have any preference for the size and dimensions of the chart?'
