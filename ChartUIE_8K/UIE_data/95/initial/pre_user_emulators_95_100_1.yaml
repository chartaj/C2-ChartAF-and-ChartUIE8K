2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize global forest area trends (1990-2020) with a choropleth map. Highlight
  countries based on forest area changes over time, using colors to indicate different
  rates of change. Include text annotations for significant changes and highlights
  to emphasize critical areas, such as regions with severe deforestation or notable
  reforestation. Ensure the map allows comparison of forest area as a proportion of
  total land area in 2020. The map should focus on drawing attention to specific countries
  while providing an overarching view of global forest trends. Visualize affected
  areas by fire from 2015 for additional context.
