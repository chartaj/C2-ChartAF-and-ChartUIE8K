initial_prompt: I need a Density plot showing the distribution of "Forest Area as
  a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020" for different countries from the dataset.
  Make sure to highlight specific regions or countries, if possible, in the plot.
  Include density curves for different time periods (1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020)
  to show how forest proportions have changed over time. Annotate key points or trends
  visible in the data. This plot will help us understand the density distribution
  and trends of forest area proportions globally. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have specific regions or countries that you would like to be
  highlighted in the plot?

  2. What color scheme would you prefer for the density curves and highlighted regions
  or countries?

  3. Should the density curves for different time periods be displayed in distinct
  colors or patterns?

  4. Would you like the annotations to include detailed statistics or general trends?

  5. Do you have a preferred style or format for highlighting key points or trends
  (e.g., arrows, labels, markers)?

  6. Should the plot include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the plot for better
  readability?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles, such as specific
  wording or orientation?

  10. Should the plot include a title or subtitle, and if so, what should it be?'
