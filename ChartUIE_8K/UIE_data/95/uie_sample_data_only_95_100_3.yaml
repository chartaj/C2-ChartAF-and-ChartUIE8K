  1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like specific markers or symbols for highlighting deforestation rates
  and fire-affected areas.

  5. Historical data should be displayed in tooltips when hovering over each country.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, a legend explaining the color coding and symbols would be helpful.
