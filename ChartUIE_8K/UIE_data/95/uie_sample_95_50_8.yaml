initial_prompt: Please create a Heatmap showing the Forest Area as a Proportion of
  Total Land Area, 2020 for different countries. Highlight deforestation (2015-2020)
  and areas affected by fire in 2015. Compare data from 1990 to 2020 for trends. ðŸŒ³
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap, such
  as a gradient from green to red?

  2. How would you like deforestation and fire-affected areas to be highlighted? Would
  you prefer specific colors or patterns?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for each country and data point, or do you
  prefer a cleaner look with a legend?

  4. Do you want the data points for 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020 to be shown
  as individual heatmaps, or combined into a single heatmap with separate sections?

  5. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to focus on or emphasize
  in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to include a timeline or any additional visual elements to highlight
  the trends over the years?

  7. Should the heatmap reflect missing data points in any specific way (e.g., grey
  color, stripes)?'
