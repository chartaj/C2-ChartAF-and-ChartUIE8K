initial_prompt: Visualize global forest area trends (1990-2020) with a choropleth
  map. Highlight countries based on forest area changes over time, using colors to
  indicate different rates of change. Include text annotations for significant changes
  and highlights to emphasize critical areas, such as regions with severe deforestation
  or notable reforestation. Ensure the map allows comparison of forest area as a proportion
  of total land area in 2020. The map should focus on drawing attention to specific
  countries while providing an overarching view of global forest trends. Visualize
  affected areas by fire from 2015 for additional context.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for indicating different rates of
  change in forest area?

  2. Do you have any specific colors you''d like to use for highlighting severe deforestation
  and notable reforestation?

  3. Should the text annotations include numerical values or just highlight the regions
  by name?

  4. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be prominently highlighted
  on the map?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement or style of text annotations for significant
  changes?

  6. Would you like to differentiate the areas affected by fire from 2015 using specific
  colors or patterns?

  7. How detailed or granular should the comparison of forest area as a proportion
  of total land area in 2020 be?'
