initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to compare forest area percentages in
  different countries for the years 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2020. Highlight significant
  differences between years. Add annotations highlighting the deforestation rates
  and areas affected by fire in 2015-2020 for specific countries. This will help visualize
  trends and emphasize environmental impacts over the decades. Provide context regarding
  global forest conservation efforts by referencing pertinent figures like total land
  area and forest area proportion. Limit the countries displayed to a manageable subset
  for clarity. Title: "Global Forest Insights 1990-2020 | FAO".'
questions: '1. Do you have specific countries in mind that you want to be included
  in the chart?

  2. Is there a preferred color scheme for the grouped bar chart?

  3. How would you like significant differences between the years to be highlighted?
  (e.g., color change, bolding, special markers)

  4. Do you have any specific annotations or labels that you would like included for
  deforestation rates and areas affected by fire?

  5. Should the grouped bar chart include a legend to distinguish between different
  years?

  6. Are there any specific styles or themes you prefer for the chart to match other
  reports or presentations?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for easier comparison of
  values?

  8. Should there be any specific emphasis on the title or subtitles other than the
  provided title "Global Forest Insights 1990-2020 | FAO"?

  9. Do you prefer the data values to be displayed on top of the bars, or would you
  like to hover over to view them?

  10. Are there any additional context or footnotes you would like to include at the
  bottom of the chart?'
