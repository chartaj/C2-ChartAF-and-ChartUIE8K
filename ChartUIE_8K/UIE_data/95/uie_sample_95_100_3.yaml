initial_prompt: I want a treemap using the data on global forests from 1990 to 2020.
  Each country should be a block sized by its total land area in 2020. The blocks
  should be color-coded by the proportion of forest area to total land area in 2020.
  Include historical forest area data (1990, 2000, 2010, 2015) as labels or tooltips.
  Highlight deforestation rates and forest area affected by fire for 2015-2020. Keep
  missing values in mind; display areas like WORLD distinctly. This will offer a visual
  representation of deforestation impact and forest distribution.
questions: '1. Would you prefer any specific color scheme for the proportion of forest
  area to total land area?

  2. How would you like missing values to be represented visually?

  3. Do you have a preference for how the "WORLD" area should be distinctly displayed?

  4. Are there any specific design elements you would like to include for highlighting
  deforestation rates and forest area affected by fire?

  5. Do you have any preference on how historical forest area data (1990, 2000, 2010,
  2015) should be displayed in labels or tooltips?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for text in the
  treemap?

  7. Would you like to include any legends or annotations in the treemap?

  8. Are there any particular countries or regions you would like to emphasize in
  the treemap?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like specific markers or symbols for highlighting deforestation rates
  and fire-affected areas.

  5. Historical data should be displayed in tooltips when hovering over each country.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, a legend explaining the color coding and symbols would be helpful.

  8. No specific countries or regions to emphasize.
