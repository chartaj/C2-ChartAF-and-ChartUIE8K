initial_prompt: Create a Sunburst chart visualizing the forest area data from the
  "Global Forest Insights 1990-2020" dataset by FAO. The chart should illustrate the
  hierarchical structure of the data, starting from the entire world, then breaking
  down into different regions or countries. Use the total land area, forest area proportions,
  and deforestation rates from 1990 to 2020 to show the changes over time. Highlight
  notable deforestation events and the proportion of total land area covered by forests
  in 2020. This will help in understanding the global and regional trends in forest
  cover and deforestation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for regions or deforestation
  events?

  2. Would you like the chart to focus more on specific years or provide a continuous
  overview from 1990 to 2020?

  3. Should notable deforestation events be highlighted with annotations or different
  shades/colors?

  4. Do you prefer to display absolute values, percentages, or both for forest area
  proportions?

  5. How detailed do you want the regional breakdown to be? Should it go down to countries,
  sub-regions, or both?

  6. Would you like tooltips to display additional data when hovering over sections
  of the chart?

  7. Is there a particular order you want the regions or countries to be displayed
  in the hierarchy?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scale or size representation of each segment
  in the Sunburst chart?

  9. Should the chart include any legends or labels? If so, what specific details
  should be included?

  10. Are there any specific design or aesthetic elements you would like incorporated
  into the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, notable deforestation events should be highlighted with different shades/colors.

  4. Both absolute values and percentages for forest area proportions.

  5. Go down to countries.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, the chart should include legends or labels showing total land area, forest
  area proportion, and deforestation rates.

  10. I am not sure.'
