initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different sports
  mentioned in the data. Use text annotations to show the exact count of each sport
  above each bar. Highlight the most mentioned sport with a distinct color to make
  it stand out. This chart aims to give a clear visual representation of the popularity
  of each sport among the data entries. The vertical axis will represent the count
  of mentions, while the horizontal axis will display different sports names. This
  chart will help in quickly understanding which sports are most and least referenced.
