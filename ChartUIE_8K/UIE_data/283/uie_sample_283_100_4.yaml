initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing various attributes related to divorces,
  including ages, occupations, and monthly incomes of both partners, among other parameters.
  I want to visualize the age distribution of divorcing individuals, split by gender,
  using a population pyramid. The x-axis should represent the number of individuals,
  while the y-axis depicts age groups. One side of the pyramid should show data for
  men, and the other side for women. This should help analyze age trends in divorce
  cases. Please create a population pyramid to illustrate these insights using the
  provided data.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the population pyramid?

  2. How would you like the age groups to be categorized (e.g., 5-year intervals,
  10-year intervals)?

  3. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  4. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Do you need grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you want to include any specific annotations or highlights on the chart?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a particular location on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific format for displaying the number of individuals on the x-axis
  (e.g., commas, decimals)?

  9. Do you have a preferred orientation for the axis labels (horizontal or vertical)?

  10. Are there any specific age ranges you want to emphasize or highlight in the
  visualization?'
