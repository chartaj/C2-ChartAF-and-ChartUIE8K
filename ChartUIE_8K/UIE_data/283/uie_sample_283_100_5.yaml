initial_prompt: 'I want a grouped bar chart that shows the average monthly income
  of divorced men and women from the given data. Group the data by age ranges (e.g.,
  20-30, 31-40, 41-50, etc.). The X-axis should represent these age ranges while the
  Y-axis shows the average monthly income in pesos. Color code the bars to differentiate
  between men and women. Ensure each age range group has two bars: one for men and
  one for women. This visualization should help understand income disparities between
  divorced men and women across different age ranges.'

  41-50?

  4. Would you like a legend to differentiate between the bars for men and women,

  5. Do you have a preference for the chart title or axis titles? If so, please specify.

  6. Should the chart maintain a specific aspect ratio or layout preference (e.g.,
  wider than taller)?

  X-axis and Y-axis?'
