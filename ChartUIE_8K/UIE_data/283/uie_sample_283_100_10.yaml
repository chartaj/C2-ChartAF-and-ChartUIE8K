initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the number of divorces per
  year by type ("Necesario" and "Voluntario"). Use the "Divorce_date" to extract the
  year and "Type_of_divorce" to categorize. Each bar should represent a year, with
  different segments showing the proportion of each divorce type. For added depth,
  color-code by "Nationality_partner_man" where possible, distinguishing between Mexican
  and others. The goal is to see trends over time, differences in divorce types, and
  any potential correlation with partner nationality. Make sure the chart is clear
  and easily interpretable, and include a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. How would you like the years to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., every year,
  every other year)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  4. Should the legend be placed within the chart area or outside it?

  5. Are there any specific font types or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?

  6. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for easier readability?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the divorce types or nationalities
  to be stacked?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or markers to highlight key trends or data
  points?

  9. Should the chart include a summary or footnote explaining the data or any trends
  observed?

  10. Are there any additional labels or data points (e.g., total number of divorces
  per year) you would like to see included on the chart?'
