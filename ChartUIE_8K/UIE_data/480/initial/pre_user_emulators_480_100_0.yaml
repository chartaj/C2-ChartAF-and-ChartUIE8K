2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a treemap visualization of the land use in Germany, showing real estate
  and other categories of land use in square kilometers. Highlight different types
  of land such as Housing & Traffic, Agriculture, and Other Land to emphasize their
  relative sizes. Use text annotations to display the exact square kilometers for
  key categories to draw attention to their values. The purpose of this visualization
  is to provide a clear, comparative view of how land is utilized in Germany, with
  easy-to-read labels and highlights to improve understanding for urban planning and
  policy analysis.
