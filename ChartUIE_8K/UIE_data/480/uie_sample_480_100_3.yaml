initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart depicting land use in Germany. The x-axis
  should represent different types of land (e.g., "Housing & traffic," "Other land,"
  "Agriculture"), while the y-axis should show the area in square kilometers. Ensure
  each bar is labeled with its corresponding type of land and the area it covers.
  Colors should be distinct for easy differentiation. Title the chart "Land Use Distribution
  in Germany" and include a legend for clarity. This chart will help visualize the
  distribution of land types in the country effectively. Thank you!
