initial_prompt: Create a Sankey chart to visualize the 2022 World Cup knockout stages
  from Round of 16 to the Final. Each node represents a match, showing the progression
  of teams and their victories. Use highlights and text annotations to emphasize winning
  teams and key match scores. The purpose of this visualization is to trace the journey
  of the winning team, Argentina, and other notable paths in the tournament. Focus
  on making the connections between rounds clear and visually distinct for better
  understanding. Use colors to differentiate stages and winners' paths. Keep the user
  engaged with contextual annotations.

  name, winner, and score?'
