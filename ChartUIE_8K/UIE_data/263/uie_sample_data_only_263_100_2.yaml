09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t know.

  3. Maybe something like "Discovery Year" for the x-axis and "Number of Planets by
  Type" for the y-axis. For the chart title, "NASA Exoplanets Discoveries by Year
  and Planet Type".

  4. Highlight significant years with high discoveries, such as 2014, 2016, and 2018.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. Maybe at the bottom of the chart.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, include gridlines. Standard style is fine.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Include text annotations for the significant years mentioned with high discoveries.'
