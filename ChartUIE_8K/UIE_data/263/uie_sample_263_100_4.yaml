initial_prompt: I want to create a geographic heatmap showing the distances of exoplanets
  from Earth. The map should highlight regions based on how many exoplanets are discovered
  and their distance. Use the distance column to create the heatmap gradient, with
  closer exoplanets having a different color intensity compared to farther ones. Make
  sure to include markers or labels for each exoplanet name and their respective discovery
  years. This will help in visualizing the distribution of exoplanets in space and
  identifying areas with high exoplanet density. Please make it interactive if possible.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for representing different distances
  on the heatmap?

  2. Do you have specific preferences for the types of markers or shapes used for
  exoplanet locations on the map?

  3. How would you like the labels for the exoplanet names and discovery years to
  be displayed (e.g., font size, font type, position)?

  4. Is there a specific map projection or geographic coordinate system you would
  like to use for the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the default zoom level or initial focal point
  of the map?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the heatmap gradient and marker
  symbols?

  7. Do you have a preference for the range of data values to be included in the heatmap
  (e.g., only exoplanets within a certain distance)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the labels to be easily readable, maybe a medium font size and a
  simple font type like Arial, positioned close to the markers.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.'
