initial_prompt: Create a heatmap illustrating the relationship between different exoplanets'
  discovery years and their respective stellar magnitudes. Highlight the cells with
  the highest and lowest stellar magnitudes to emphasize outliers. Annotate key data
  points with the planet's name and its distance from Earth to provide context. This
  visualization will help identify trends or anomalies in the discovery timeline and
  stellar characteristics of exoplanets, aiding in the analysis of discovery patterns
  and their correlations with stellar properties. The primary audience for this chart
  is astronomers and space enthusiasts seeking insights from NASAâ€™s exoplanet data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for annotations and labels?

  3. Do you have a preferred format for the annotations (e.g., "Planet Name (Distance)"
  or "Distance: X, Planet Name: Y")?

  4. Should the heatmap include a color legend for stellar magnitudes?

  5. How would you like the highest and lowest stellar magnitudes to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific colors, borders)?

  6. Do you prefer a specific range of years to be displayed on the x-axis?

  7. Should the heatmap be fixed size or flexible layout according to the screen size?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap for better readability?

  9. Do you have any preferred margin sizes around the heatmap?

  10. Are there specific positions you would like the annotations to be placed in
  (e.g., always above or beside the data points)?

  11. Should the heatmap display missing data in a specific way, like a distinct color
  or pattern?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I do not know about the font style or size.

  3. "Planet Name (Distance)" would work.

  4. Yes, a color legend for stellar magnitudes would be helpful.

  5. Maybe specific colors for the highest and lowest magnitudes.

  6. I am not sure about the range of years.

  7. I do not know about the layout.

  8. I think grid lines might help with readability.

  9. I have no specific preference for margin sizes.

  10. Always beside the data points would be good.

  11. Yes, display missing data in a distinct color or pattern.'
