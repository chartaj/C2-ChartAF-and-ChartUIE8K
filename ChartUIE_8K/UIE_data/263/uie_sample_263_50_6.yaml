initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing exoplanets, with distance on the
  x-axis and stellar magnitude on the y-axis. Color points by planet type.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  planet types?

  2. Would you like to include labels for each data point or just use a legend?

  3. Do you have a preferred size or shape for the scatter plot points?

  4. Should the axes be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  5. Is there a specific range for the x-axis (distance) or y-axis (stellar magnitude)
  you would like to focus on?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  8. Do you need any specific annotations or markers to highlight particular data
  points or trends?'
