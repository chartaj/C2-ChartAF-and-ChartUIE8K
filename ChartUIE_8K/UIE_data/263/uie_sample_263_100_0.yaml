initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the discovery year of exoplanets on the
  x-axis and the number of exoplanets discovered each year on the y-axis. Use text
  annotations to highlight notable years such as 2007, 2008, and 2009 and annotate
  with the names of exoplanets like '11 Comae Berenices b'. Highlight the lines or
  markers for these years to make them stand out. This visualization aims to analyze
  the trend in exoplanet discoveries over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for highlighting the notable years
  (2007, 2008, 2009) on the chart?

  2. Would you like the line to be smooth or straight between points?

  3. Do you have a specific font preference for the text annotations?

  4. What specific size should the text annotations be?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Would you like markers at each data point, or just a continuous line?

  7. Should the y-axis start at zero or auto-scale based on the data?

  8. Do you prefer any specific style for the line, such as dashed or solid?

  9. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart, and if so, how should it
  be labeled?

  10. Is there a specific width and height you prefer for the chart?

  11. Do you want any specific titles or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  12. Should the chart include a title, and if so what should it say?

  13. Would you like any specific background color for the chart?'
