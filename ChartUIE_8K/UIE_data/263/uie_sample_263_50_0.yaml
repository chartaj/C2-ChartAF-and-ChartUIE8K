initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the number of planets discovered per year.
  Highlight significant years and add text annotations for notable planets, distances,
  and discovery methods. This will help visualize trends over time in planetary discovery.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  highlighting significant years?

  2. Would you like a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Should the annotations include additional details like the planet''s type or
  just focus on the distance and discovery method?

  4. How would you like the significant years to be highlighted â€” using markers, different
  line styles, or a different color for those segments?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  wording in mind?

  6. Are there any other specific years or events you would like to be highlighted
  that might not be apparent from the data?

  7. Should the y-axis (number of planets discovered) have a specific range or should
  it auto-scale based on the data?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Just focus on the distance and discovery method.

  4. Using markers.

  5. Yes, title: "Number of Planets Discovered Per Year"; x-axis: "Year"; y-axis:
  "Number of Planets Discovered".

  6. I am not sure.

  7. It should auto-scale based on the data.'
