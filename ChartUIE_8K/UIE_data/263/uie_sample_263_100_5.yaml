initial_prompt: I want a bar chart visualizing NASA's exoplanet data. The X-axis should
  show discovery years and the Y-axis should show the count of discovered exoplanets
  for each year. Highlight the planet types with different colors. Make sure the chart
  also includes labels and a legend for clarity. This will help illustrate the discovery
  trends of various planet types over time.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a particular order for the planet types when highlighting
  them with different colors?

  2. Do you have any specific color scheme or palette in mind for the different planet
  types?

  3. Would you like the chart title to be customized, and if so, what should it be?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels have any specific formatting or font style
  preferences?

  5. Do you have any particular font preferences or sizes for the chart labels and
  legend?

  6. Should the bars be displayed in a specific style or shape, such as traditional,
  stacked, or grouped bars?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, should they be subtle or prominent?

  8. Do you prefer any specific positioning for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) to enhance clarity?

  9. Are there any annotations or additional information you would like to include
  on the chart?

  10. Do you require any specific margins or padding between the elements of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific color scheme or palette in mind.

  3. I would like the title to be "Exoplanet Discoveries by Year and Type".

  4. I do not have any specific preferences for axis label formatting or font style.

  5. I have no specific font preferences or sizes for the chart labels and legend.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would like the grid lines to be subtle.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I do not have any additional annotations or information to include.

  10. I do not have any specific requirements for margins or padding.'
