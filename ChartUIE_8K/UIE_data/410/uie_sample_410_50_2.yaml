initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing worldwide search trends for "wizard"
  and "witch" over time. Highlight months with peak searches, annotate those peaks
  for both terms. Use contrasting colors for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for contrasting "wizard" and "witch"
  searches?

  2. Are there specific months or time periods you are most interested in that should
  be emphasized?

  3. Would you like the x-axis labels to display every month, or would a less frequent
  label interval be sufficient (e.g., quarterly)?

  4. How detailed should the annotations for the peak months be (e.g., exact search
  numbers, percentage increase)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for annotations and labels?

  6. Should there be gridlines on the chart for better readability, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  7. Do you have any preference for legends placement (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)
  for clearer identification of data series?'
