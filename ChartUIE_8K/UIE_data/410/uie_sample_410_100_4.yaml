initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the google search trends for "wizard"
  and "witch" over time, across the dataset provided. Please plot "Monat" on the x-axis,
  and the search trend data for "wizard" and "witch" on the y-axis. Ensure each trend
  has a distinct color for easy differentiation and include a legend. This will help
  me understand the monthly popularity changes between these two search terms. The
  data comes from literature and linguistics, making it crucial for my analysis of
  keyword usage trends over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for differentiating the trends for
  "wizard" and "witch"?

  2. What line styles do you prefer for each trend (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  3. Do you want to include data markers for each data point along the lines?

  4. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Do you have a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  7. Would you like gridlines on your chart for easier readability?

  8. Do you want the x-axis to show each month, or would you prefer a different time
  interval display (e.g., yearly or quarterly)?

  9. Would you prefer any particular annotation (such as peak points or trend changes)
  on the chart?'
