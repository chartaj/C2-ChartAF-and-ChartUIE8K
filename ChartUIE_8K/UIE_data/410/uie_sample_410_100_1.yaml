initial_prompt: Create a spline chart to visualize the global search trends for "wizard"
  and "witch" from 2004. Highlight notable spikes and dips in the data using color
  variations. Add text annotations to indicate the highest and lowest points for each
  term to draw attention to significant trends. Ensure the x-axis represents the months

  of the trends.
