initial_prompt: Please create an area chart using the Walmart sales data to visualize
  Weekly_Sales over time (Date). Highlight the periods with Holiday_Flag set to 1
  in a different color to emphasize their impact on sales. Annotate the data points
  with the highest and lowest sales values to draw attention to these outliers. Ensure
  the labels for axes, including Temperature, Fuel_Price, CPI, and Unemployment, are
  clear to provide context. This visualization will help in understanding the trends
  and key factors affecting sales performance, aiding business decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart, particularly
  for differentiating the holiday periods?

  2. Would you like the highest and lowest sales values annotated with specific text
  or just symbol markers?

  3. Is there a specific style you prefer for the axis labels (font size, font type,
  etc.)?

  4. How detailed would you like the contextual information (Temperature, Fuel_Price,
  CPI, Unemployment) to be in the axis labels?

  5. Would you prefer gridlines in the chart for better readability? If so, should
  they apply to both axes or just one?

  6. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend on the chart (top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  7. Should the chart include a title? If so, any specific wording for it?

  8. Would you prefer the annotations for outliers to be placed directly on the chart
  or in a separate section below/above the chart?'
