initial_prompt: I need a box plot showing the distribution of Weekly_Sales across
  different Stores. The x-axis should represent store numbers, and the y-axis should
  show Weekly_Sales. Each box should capture the range of sales data for each store.
  Please include outliers and medians to provide a clear view of the sales performance
  per store. The chart should help me identify which stores are performing well and
  which are underperforming based on their weekly sales data. This will aid in making
  informed business decisions for improving sales in lower-performing stores.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box plot?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?

  3. Should the x-axis be labeled with store numbers or store names (if available)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a title and, if so, any specific wording
  for it?

  6. Do you want to display any additional statistical information such as means or
  quartiles on the box plot?

  7. Should the boxes be displayed with a specific width or padding between them?

  8. Do you prefer the plot to be displayed horizontally instead of vertically?

  9. Are there any specific stores you would like to be highlighted or differentiated?'
