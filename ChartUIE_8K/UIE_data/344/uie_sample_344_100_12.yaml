initial_prompt: Create a dumbbell chart comparing the salary ranges of different blockchain-related
  job titles in India for 2022 from Glassdoor data. Use the lower and upper salary
  limits for each job title, with markers indicating whether it's an "Easy Apply"
  position. This will help visualize the salary distribution and ease of application
  for roles in companies like Infosys, Synergy Labs, etc. Ensure that each job title,
  company, and location is displayed clearly to illustrate the differences. Highlight
  the unique values and ensure missing values are considered in the design.
