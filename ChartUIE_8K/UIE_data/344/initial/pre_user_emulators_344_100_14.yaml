- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Choropleth map that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Choropleth map
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a Choropleth map visualizing the distribution of blockchain-related
  job opportunities in India for 2022, using data from Glassdoor.com. Make sure to
  highlight the number of job postings per state, with the color intensity representing
  the concentration of job posts. Additionally, include details such as the average
  salary range for the jobs in each state. Use data provided including job titles,
  companies, locations, easy apply options, and salary limits. This map will help
  understand which areas have the most blockchain job opportunities and the potential
  salary expectation in those areas.
