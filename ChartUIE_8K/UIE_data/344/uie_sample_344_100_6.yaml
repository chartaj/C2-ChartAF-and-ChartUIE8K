initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing the distribution of
  blockchain jobs in India for 2022. The data includes company names, job titles,
  locations, whether easy apply options are available, and salary ranges. Highlight
  job density in different locations using intensity levels to show where blockchain
  job opportunities are concentrated. Include key identifying metrics such as number
  of job postings per location, unique companies, and salary ranges. Utilize color
  gradients to represent these variables effectively, ensuring the map is both informative
  and visually appealing. Also, ensure the labels are clear for easy interpretation.
questions: "1. Do you have a preference for the color gradient or specific color palette\
  \ used for indicating job density?\n2. How would you like the map labels to be styled?\
  \ Any particular font or size preference?\n3. Do you prefer the map to include markers\
  \ or icons for unique companies in addition to the heatmap?\n4. Should the salary\
  \ range be represented with a separate color gradient or integrated into the same\
  \ heatmap?\n5. Would you prefer including a legend explaining the intensity levels\
  \ and color gradients directly on the map or on the side?\n6. Do you want the locations\
  \ to display additional information (e.g., number of job postings, company names)\
  \ on hover or click? \n7. Do you have any specific preference for the geographic\
  \ projection type (e.g., Mercator, Albers)?\n8. Should the map include a scale bar\
  \ for reference?"
