initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map visualizing the distribution of blockchain-related
  job opportunities in India for 2022, using data from Glassdoor.com. Make sure to
  highlight the number of job postings per state, with the color intensity representing
  the concentration of job posts. Additionally, include details such as the average
  salary range for the jobs in each state. Use data provided including job titles,
  companies, locations, easy apply options, and salary limits. This map will help
  understand which areas have the most blockchain job opportunities and the potential
  salary expectation in those areas.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Choropleth map?

  2. Would you like to include state labels on the map?

  3. How would you prefer the salary ranges to be displayed â€” as exact figures or

  4. Should the number of job postings be displayed as absolute values or as percentages
  relative to the highest posting state?

  5. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Albers, Mercator)?

  6. Should there be any legends or tooltips to explain the color intensity and other
  data points?

  7. Would you like to highlight specific states or regions for emphasis?

  8. Do you want to include any additional data points, such as job titles or companies,
  in the map?

  9. Should the map include any annotations or text explanations for certain regions?

  10. What level of detail do you prefer for the map''s geographic boundaries (e.g.,
  states only, districts within states)?'
