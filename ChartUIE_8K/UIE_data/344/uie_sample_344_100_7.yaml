initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for the data from the dataset "Blockchain
  Jobs India 2022 Glassdoor.com" under the category "cryptocurrency-and-blockchain".
  I would like the histogram to show the distribution of job listings by their salary
  range. Specifically, it should include the frequency of listings within the given
  lower and upper salary limits. This will help visualize the most common salary ranges
  for blockchain-related positions in India. Ensure that the x-axis represents the
  salary ranges while the y-axis represents the count of job listings within those
  salary brackets. Thank you!
questions: '1. What bin width would you prefer for the salary ranges on the x-axis?

  2. Do you have a specific salary range to set as the lower and upper bounds on the
  x-axis?

  3. Would you like any specific labeling or formatting for the x-axis salary range
  values?

  4. Do you prefer any specific color scheme for the histogram bars?

  5. Would you like to add any particular titles or labels to the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Should the histogram display any gridlines or background shading for better readability?

  7. Do you want to include any annotations or data labels showing the count of job
  listings within each salary range?'
