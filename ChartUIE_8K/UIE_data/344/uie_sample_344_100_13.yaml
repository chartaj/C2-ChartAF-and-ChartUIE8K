initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization for the dataset "Blockchain Jobs India
  2022" from Glassdoor.com, found in the file '../Extra_datas/data/344.csv'. This
  chart should display job titles in blocks sized by the range between the salary
  lower and upper limits, and color-coded by company. Highlight companies with more
  unique job titles. Consider including easy-apply jobs in a distinct color. Use location
  data to label each block with the respective city or indicate if it's a remote role.
  Ensure all details are clear and easy to interpret for quick analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the treemap visualization?

  2. How would you like the ''Easy Apply'' jobs to be color-coded?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels (cities or remote
  roles) inside the blocks?

  4. Should specific companies or job titles be highlighted in a distinct way besides
  color coding?

  5. Are there any additional details or information you want to include in the tooltip
  (if any) when hovering over the blocks?'

  1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure, maybe something distinct like bright yellow or orange.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size.

  4. I don''t know, just highlighting companies with more unique job titles should
  be enough.

  5. I am not sure, include any additional relevant information if you think it will
  help.
