initial_prompt: Please create a Lollipop chart to visualize the data from the 2022
  Blockchain Jobs in India data. The chart should show job Titles on the x-axis and
  Salary_Range (from Salary_Lower_Limit to Salary_Upper_Limit) on the y-axis. Use
  text annotations to display actual Salary_Ranges for the key jobs like "Consultant,"
  "Blockchain Developer Intern," and "Trainer." Also, use highlights to distinguish
  job roles with "Easy Apply" options. The practical purpose is to allow job seekers
  to easily compare salary ranges and identify jobs with easy apply options.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting job roles with
  "Easy Apply" options?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the text annotations for the Salary_Ranges be placed directly above the
  lollipop points, or do you have a different preference?

  4. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical orientation for the x-axis labels (job Titles)
  for better readability?

  5. Would you like to see the chart title or any additional headers or footers on
  the chart?

  6. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the annotations and
  axis labels?'

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Horizontal orientation for the x-axis labels would be preferable for better readability.
