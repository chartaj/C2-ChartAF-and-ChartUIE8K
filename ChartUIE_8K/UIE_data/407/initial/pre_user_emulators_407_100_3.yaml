  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Spline chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Spline chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a Spline chart to visualize the coin prices for 10 months as provided
  in the data. The chart should plot the dates on the X-axis and the corresponding
  coin values on the Y-axis. Ensure that the chart clearly shows the price trends
  over time. Include markers to indicate each data point and a smooth line connecting
  the points to better illustrate the price flow. Adding subtle grid lines would enhance
  the readability of the chart. There should also be clear labels for the axes and
  a title that mentions the time period and the cryptocurrency focus.
