initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the coin price over a period of
  10 months. Highlight significant price changes and focus on particular dates like
  April 14, 2018, when the price was 8140.71, and April 16, 2018, with a value of
  8371.15. Use text annotations to emphasize these key points. This visualization
  will help in understanding the trends and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market
  over the specified period. Ensure the chart provides a clear view of the overall
  performance while drawing attention to critical price movements for better analysis
  and insight.
