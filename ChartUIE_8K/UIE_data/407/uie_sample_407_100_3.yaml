initial_prompt: Please create a Spline chart to visualize the coin prices for 10 months
  as provided in the data. The chart should plot the dates on the X-axis and the corresponding
  coin values on the Y-axis. Ensure that the chart clearly shows the price trends
  over time. Include markers to indicate each data point and a smooth line connecting
  the points to better illustrate the price flow. Adding subtle grid lines would enhance
  the readability of the chart. There should also be clear labels for the axes and
  a title that mentions the time period and the cryptocurrency focus.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line and markers?

  2. Would you like the markers to have a particular shape (e.g., circles, squares,
  diamonds)?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  4. Do you have a preference for the thickness of the line in the spline chart?

  5. Should the grid lines be displayed in a particular style or color?

  6. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where should it be
  positioned?

  7. Is there a specific format for the date labels on the X-axis that you prefer?'
