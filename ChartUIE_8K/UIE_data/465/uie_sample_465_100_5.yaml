initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the data provided. Plot 'total_bill'
  on the x-axis and 'tip' on the y-axis. Differentiate the points by 'sex' and use
  different colors for 'smoker' categories. Add markers to distinguish between 'day'
  and use size of markers to represent 'size'. Ensure the plot is clear and easy to
  interpret for a social-science study analyzing restaurant tipping behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate
  the ''smoker'' categories?

  2. How would you like the ''sex'' of the individuals to be visually differentiated
  on the scatter plot (e.g., different shapes, borders)?

  3. Are there particular marker styles you prefer to distinguish between ''day''
  (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  4. Do you have a preferred size range for the markers representing different ''size''
  values?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the plot (e.g., indicating
  outliers or notable points)?

  6. Do you have any specific title or axis labels in mind for the scatter plot?

  7. Are there particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text in the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different shapes would be good for differentiating between ''sex.''

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure about the size range.

  5. I do not have a preference for specific annotations or labels.

  6. The title could be "Restaurant Tipping Behavior Analysis" and the axis labels
  as "Total Bill" and "Tip".

  7. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.'
