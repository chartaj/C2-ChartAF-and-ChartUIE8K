initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart using the provided data. Plot "total_bill" on
  the x-axis and "tip" on the y-axis. Use the "size" column to determine the size
  of the bubbles. Color the bubbles based on the "day" column to distinguish between
  different days of the week. Ensure the chart is clear and has appropriate labels
  and a legend. Please include a title for the chart that reflects what is being visualized.
  This will help in social science research to analyze tipping behavior across different
  bills and days.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  distinguish between different days of the week?

  2. What level of detail would you prefer for the chart title?

  3. Do you have a specific format or wording in mind for the axis labels?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart text?

  5. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers on the chart?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement and design of the legend?

  7. Are there any particular gridlines or background styles you prefer?

  8. Should the chart include any specific note or disclaimer for clarity in research
  context?

  9. Would you like to see any specific data point highlighted or emphasized?

  10. Do you have any preference on the aspect ratio or size of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure; use a color palette that distinctively separates the days.

  2. I do not know; maybe something straightforward like "Tipping Behavior Analysis
  Based on Total Bill and Day".

  3. Label the x-axis as "Total Bill ($)" and the y-axis as "Tip ($)".

  4. I have no specific preference for fonts or sizes.

  5. I am not sure; do whatever you think is best.

  6. Please place the legend outside the main plot area, maybe to the right.

  7. I do not know; standard gridlines and background should be fine.

  8. I have no specific preference for this.

  9. I am not sure about this.

  10. I do not know; use the aspect ratio that best fits the data.'
