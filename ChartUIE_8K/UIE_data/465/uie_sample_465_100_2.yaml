initial_prompt: '<start of user instructions>

  Create a pie chart to visualize the proportion of total bills categorized by ''sex''.
  Highlight the segments by sex to show their distribution among male and female patrons.
  Include text annotations for each segment to display the percentage of total bills
  attributed to each sex. This visualization aims to provide a clear overview of spending
  differences between males and females at the restaurant. Avoid using any missing
  value imputation methods, as there are no missing values in this dataset. Ensure
  the chart is clear and easy to understand for social science analysis.
