  USD for different job categories listed in the dataset. Use text annotations to
  highlight the highest and lowest salary points within the chart. Highlight bars
  that represent significant salary differences between categories, particularly focusing
  on 'Data Engineering' and 'Data Architecture and Modeling'. This visualization aims
