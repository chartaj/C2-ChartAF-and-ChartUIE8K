initial_prompt: 'Create a column chart titled "Jobs and Salaries in Data Science."
  The chart should display the average salary_in_usd for different job titles within
  various job categories. Use data from ''88.csv''. The x-axis should represent job
  titles, categorized by job categories, and the y-axis should show the average salary
  in USD. Separate the columns by employment type: Full-time, Part-time, and Freelance.
  Add a legend to differentiate the employment types and use different colors for
  each job category. This will help visualize salary differences across roles and
  employment types.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the job categories?

  2. Do you want to include data labels on top of each column to show the exact average
  salary in USD?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the y-axis for easier comparison of salaries?

  4. Do you have a specific order in mind for the job categories and job titles on
  the x-axis, or should they be sorted alphabetically/by average salary?

  5. Should the y-axis have a specific range or interval, or can it be determined
  automatically based on the data?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and chart title?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or callouts for highlighting significant
  salary differences or specific job roles?'
