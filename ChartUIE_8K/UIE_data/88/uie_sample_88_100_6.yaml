initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing job roles, categories, and salaries within
  the data science field for the year 2023. I want a stacked bar chart that visualizes
  the distribution of job categories across different experience levels, with the
  bars representing salary ranges in USD. Each bar segment should show the proportion
  of job categories within each experience level, helping me compare the salary distribution
  across different job categories and experience levels. This will illustrate salary
  progression and category density at various experience stages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to indicate the job categories?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on the chart segments?

  4. How would you like the experience levels to be ordered on the x-axis? (e.g.,
  ascending, descending)

  5. Is there a specific way you want the salary ranges divided within each bar?

  6. Do you want the chart to include a title and axis labels? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Should the y-axis represent the salary in USD or another metric?

  8. Are there specific ranges of experience levels or salary ranges you want to highlight?

  9. Do you have any preferences for font styles or sizes for the chart text?

  10. Should the bars be displayed vertically or horizontally?'
