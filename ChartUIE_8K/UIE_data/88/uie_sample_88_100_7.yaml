initial_prompt: Using the provided data, create a choropleth map visualizing the average
  salary_in_usd for different employee_residence locations. This should highlight
  where data science and analytics jobs pay the most, reflecting insights into regional
  salary differences. Countries with higher salaries should be colored darker, while
  those with lower salaries should be lighter. Use a color gradient that is easy to
  interpret, include a legend, and ensure the map is readable. The goal is to help
  visualize salary disparities in the data science field across various countries
  or regions. Thank you!
