initial_prompt: Create a bar chart displaying the unique values of each fault type
  (Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults). Include annotations
  for the highest and lowest values. The visualization should highlight steel plate
  thickness and emphasize the differences between steel types A300 and A400.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the bar chart to differentiate
  fault types?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used in annotations?

  3. How would you like the steel types (A300 and A400) to be visually distinguished
  (e.g., different colors, patterns)?

  4. Would you prefer the steel plate thickness to be shown as an additional series
  or as labels on the bars?

  5. Are there specific axis labels or titles you would like to use for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall chart dimensions (width and height)?

  7. Should the bars be sorted in a particular order (e.g., ascending/descending based
  on fault type values)?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout of the chart (e.g., legend
  position, grid lines)?

  9. Are there any specific fault types you would like to highlight or de-emphasize
  in the chart?'
