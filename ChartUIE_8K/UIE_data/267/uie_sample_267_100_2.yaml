initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the frequency of different fault types
  in steel plates using the given data. The x-axis should represent the fault categories
  (Pastry, Z_Scratch, K_Scatch, Stains, Dirtiness, Bumps, Other_Faults) and the y-axis
  should display the count of occurrences. Highlight the most common faults with distinct
  colors. Add data-driven annotations to indicate the exact values of the most frequent
  and least frequent faults. This will help identify prevalent issues in urban-planning
  projects that involve steel plate inspection and quality control. Title it "Frequency
  of Faulty Steel Plate Issues".
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the distinct colors used to highlight
  the most common faults?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted by frequency, ascending or descending?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart title and annotations?

  4. Should the annotations for the exact values of the most frequent and least frequent
  faults be placed at the top of the bars or inside the bars?

  5. Is there a specific color for the bars representing the least frequent faults?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer a specific theme or background color for the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis display absolute counts or percentages of occurrences?

  9. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to add to the chart?

  10. Would you like to include axis titles or any additional descriptions on the
  chart?'
