initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualizing the "Faulty Steel Plates" dataset. Use
  "Pixels_Areas" for the size of the rectangles and "Luminosity_Index" for color.
  Include "X_Minimum" and "Y_Minimum" as identifiers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color palette used to represent
  the "Luminosity_Index"?

  2. Would you like the treemap to have labels for each rectangle displaying the values
  of "X_Minimum" and "Y_Minimum"?

  3. Should the rectangles display their "Pixels_Areas" value directly on the treemap?

  4. Do you have any preference for the layout or style of the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice-dice)?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for "Luminosity_Index" that you would
  like to highlight with different colors?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color scale of the "Luminosity_Index"?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels on the treemap?

  8. Should the treemap include any additional annotations or markers for specific
  data points?

  9. Is there a need for any tooltips or hover effects to display additional data
  when hovering over a rectangle?

  10. Do you have any size preference for the overall treemap to fit within a specific
  space or dimension?'
