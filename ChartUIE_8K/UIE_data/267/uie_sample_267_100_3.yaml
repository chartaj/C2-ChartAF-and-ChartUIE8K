initial_prompt: I need a treemap visualization for the Faulty Steel Plates data. Each
  tile should represent a different column in the dataset, segmented by values like
  'Pixels_Areas' or 'Sum_of_Luminosity'. The size of each tile should reflect the
  magnitude of that value, while the color intensity could indicate another dimension
  like 'Edges_Index' or 'Luminosity_Index'. Please include samples from the 'Pastry',
  'Z_Scratch', and 'K_Scatch' columns to highlight different fault categories. Use
  color gradients to enhance visual distinction among different factors. Ensure the
  treemap is easy to interpret and reflects the key data insights.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the color gradients?  \n\
  2. Should the color gradient be sequential or diverging?  \n3. Do you prefer a specific\
  \ arrangement or sorting order for the tiles?  \n4. Would you like the data labels\
  \ to be displayed on the tiles?  \n5. Do you have any specific preferences for font\
  \ style or size for the labels?  \n6. Should the chart include a legend explaining\
  \ the color gradients?  \n7. Do you have a preference for the background color of\
  \ the treemap?  \n8. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the\
  \ tiles?  \n9. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the treemap?\
  \  \n10. Do you have preferences for the aspect ratio of the treemap?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, any suggestion you have?

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please display the data labels on the tiles.

  5. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  6. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining the color gradients.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific preferences for margins or padding.

  9. I am not sure about additional annotations or markers.

  10. I do not have a specific preference for the aspect ratio.'
