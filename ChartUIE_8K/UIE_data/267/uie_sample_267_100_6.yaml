initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map highlighting different regions based on the
  presence of Pastry defects in steel plates. Use the 'X_Minimum' and 'Y_Minimum'
  columns for geographic coordinates. Color the map regions by the count of Pastry
  defects. Make sure to include a legend explaining the color coding.

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the legend explaining the color
