initial_prompt: I want to create a bar chart that visualizes the Shark Tank India
  investments. The x-axis should represent the "Brand" names and the y-axis should
  show the "Investment Amount (In Lakhs INR)". Each bar should be color-coded by the
  investors' names who invested (Anupam, Ashneer, Vineeta, etc.). Please also ensure
  the chart differentiates between companies that received 100% equity versus those
  that received less.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars representing different
  investors?

  2. How would you like the chart to differentiate between companies that received
  100% equity versus those that received less? (e.g., different bar patterns, border
  colors, or annotations)

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be stacked or grouped for each brand when multiple
  investors are involved?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you''d like to include on the bars
  or axes?

  5. Would you like to see gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be major
  gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or limits for the x-axis and y-axis that you
  would like to enforce?

  9. Would you like to incorporate any specific backgrounds or themes into the chart
  (e.g., light, dark, custom themes)?

  10. Should the chart include data labels on each bar to show the exact investment
  amounts and equity percentages?'
