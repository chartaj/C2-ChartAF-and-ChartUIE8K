initial_prompt: I need a pie chart visualization using the Shark Tank Indian Companies
  dataset. The pie chart should display the distribution of investment amounts across
  different brands from the sample dataset provided. Each slice of the pie should
  represent a different brand's investment amount, and the labels should include the
  brand names. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to read, showing how the investments
  are divided among the brands. This will help in understanding the investment trends
  among the companies featured in Shark Tank India Season 1.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Should the pie chart include percentage labels along with the investment amounts?

  3. Would you like the chart to have a legend or are the labels on the slices sufficient?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle? If yes, what should they be?

  6. Do you want the slices of the pie chart to be separated or together?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you would like the slices to be arranged (e.g.,
  descending order of investment amount)?

  8. Are there specific brands you want to highlight or emphasize on the chart?'
