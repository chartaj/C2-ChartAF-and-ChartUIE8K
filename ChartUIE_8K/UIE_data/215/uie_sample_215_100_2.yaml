initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize investments from Shark Tank India.
  Each bubble should represent a brand, sized by the investment amount. Position bubbles
  based on episode number and highlight those with equity stakes of different percentages.
  Annotations should display brand names and investment details. Use different colors
  for each shark involved. The purpose is to easily compare investment sizes and involvement
  of sharks across episodes. Include text and highlight elements to emphasize significant
  deals. This visual aid helps quickly grasp investment patterns and standout deals
  in the series data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to represent different
  sharks?

  2. How would you like the significant deals to be highlighted (e.g., larger bubble
  size, bolder borders, specific colors)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations displaying
  brand names and investment details?

  4. Should there be a legend or labels indicating specific sharks and their corresponding
  colors?

  5. Is there a preferred layout or order for presenting episodes on the chart?

  6. Would you like any additional text elements or notes within the chart to emphasize
  key insights?

  7. Are there specific threshold values for equity percentages that you want to highlight
  differently?

  8. Do you have specific preferences for the size scaling of the bubbles based on
  investment amount?

  9. Should the chart include grid lines or any specific background design elements?

  10. Would you like to see any other filters or categorization options integrated
  into the chart?'
