initial_prompt: '

  Please create a grouped column chart using the Shark Tank India Companies dataset.
  The x-axis should represent different brands, and the y-axis should show the investment
  amount in lakhs INR. Each brand should have columns grouped by the investors (Anupam,
  Ashneer, Namita, Aman, Peyush, Vineeta, Ghazal) who invested in them, highlighting
  how much each investor contributed to the respective brands. This will help visualize
  which brands received investments from which investors and the amount they invested.
  Use contrasting colors for each investor to make the chart clear and easy to read.'
