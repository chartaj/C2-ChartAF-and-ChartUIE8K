initial_prompt: Visualize the hierarchical organizational decision-making structure
  of the business using a Sunburst Chart. Highlight the different levels from CEO
  to individual team members (levels 2 and 3) to emphasize the structure. Use text
  annotations to display names like 'CEO', 'boss1', 'boss2', and individual team members
  (e.g., mister_a, mister_b). This chart should provide a clear and intuitive understanding
