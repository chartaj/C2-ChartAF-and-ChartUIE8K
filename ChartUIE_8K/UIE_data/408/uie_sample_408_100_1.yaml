initial_prompt: Create a dendrogram to visualize the organizational decision-making
  structure in a business context. Highlight the relationships between the CEO, 'boss'
  levels, and individual team members. Annotate specific elements like the names of
  the CEO and subordinates to focus attention on their hierarchical positions. Use
  colors or sizes to emphasize 'boss' levels. The aim is to clearly depict the chain
  of command and aid in understanding the structure's complexity for strategic business
  planning. Keep the chart simple, ensuring it remains accessible to stakeholders
  with varying levels of understanding.
