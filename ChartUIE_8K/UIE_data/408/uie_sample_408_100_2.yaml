initial_prompt: Create a Tree Map based on the given data, showcasing the hierarchical
  organizational structure of a business, specifically focusing on the 'children'
  and 'name' columns. Use annotations to highlight key figures such as 'CEO' and the
  different 'bosses' and 'misters' under their leadership. The purpose is to visually
  represent decision-making levels and relationships within the organization. Include
  text annotations to provide context and clarity for each individual’s role, drawing
  attention to key stakeholders. Highlights should be used to differentiate between
  the various hierarchical levels, making the structure more intuitive to understand.
