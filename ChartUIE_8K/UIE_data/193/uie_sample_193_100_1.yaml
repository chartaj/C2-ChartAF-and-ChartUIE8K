initial_prompt: Visualize the star dataset using a heatmap to highlight correlations
  between temperature, luminosity, radius, and absolute magnitude across different
  spectral classes. Annotate notable values for easier identification, focusing on
  extreme temperatures and luminosities. Highlight unique colors and spectral classes
  for clear differentiation. The overall goal is to reveal patterns and outliers in
  star properties, aiding in understanding stellar classifications.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences regarding the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to set specific color gradients for extreme temperatures and luminosities?

  3. Are there any preferred methods for annotating notable values on the heatmap?

  4. Do you want a specific range of values to be highlighted for easier identification?

  5. Should the spectral classes have distinct colors or markers for clear differentiation?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be for identifying extreme temperatures and
  luminosities?

  7. Would you prefer the heatmap to display values as text within the cells?

  8. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for annotations and
  labels?

  9. Should the heatmap include a legend for the color gradients used?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the layout of the heatmap, such as axis labels
  or titles?'
