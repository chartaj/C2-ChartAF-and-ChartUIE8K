initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the distribution of the different
  spectral classes (Spectral_Class) of stars and their corresponding types (Type).
  The x-axis should represent the spectral classes, while the y-axis should show the
  count of stars in each class categorized by their type. Utilize different colors
  to differentiate between the star types (0 to 5) to reflect their distribution.
  This visualization will help in understanding the prevalence of each spectral class
  and type among the dataset described, focusing on the characteristics like temperature,
  luminosity, radius, and other attributes.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to differentiate between
  the star types (0 to 5)?

  3. Would you like to display the exact count of stars above the columns?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Should the chart have gridlines for better readability?

  6. Would you prefer the legend to be displayed at a specific location (e.g., top,
  right, bottom)?

  7. Is there a specific order you would like the spectral classes to appear on the
  x-axis?

  8. Do you prefer a specific width for the columns to enhance clarity?

  9. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?

  10. Would you like to include annotations or notes on the chart to highlight particular
  insights?'
