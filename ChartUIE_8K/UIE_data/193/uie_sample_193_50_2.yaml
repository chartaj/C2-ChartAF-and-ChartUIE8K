initial_prompt: Visualize star data using a violin plot to compare Temperature across
  Types. Use annotations to highlight extreme values and unique Spectral Classes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the violin plot?

  2. Would you like the chart to have gridlines, and if so, in what style (e.g., dashed,
  solid)?

  3. How would you like the annotations for extreme values to be formatted (e.g.,
  color, font size)?

  4. Should the unique Spectral Classes be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., different
  colors, shapes)?

  5. Do you prefer displaying the data density in the violin plot with or without
  an overlaid boxplot?

  6. Is there a specific ordering you would like for the Types on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ascending, descending)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it be placed
  on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like on the axes?

  9. Do you wish to include any contextual or additional information in the chart
  (e.g., a subtitle, footnotes)?

  10. Would you like to have different line styles or widths for the sections of the
  violins representing different temperature ranges?'
