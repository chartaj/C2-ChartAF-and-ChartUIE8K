initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of 'Type'
  across 'Spectral_Class' from the NASA star type classification data. For each spectral
  class, the bars should be divided by type. Use different colors for each 'Type'.
  Include labels for both axes and a legend. The x-axis should show the 'Spectral_Class'
  categories and the y-axis should display the count of each 'Type'. This will help
  in understanding how star types are distributed across different spectral classes
  in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different ''Type'' categories
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Do you have specific preferences for the font and size of the axis labels and
  legend?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the ordering of ''Spectral_Class'' categories
  on the x-axis?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you require any specific chart title or additional annotations on the chart?

  6. Are there any particular styles or themes you prefer for the chart background
  or bars (e.g., gradient fills, borders)?

  7. Do you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific position (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right) in the chart?

  8. Are there any additional details or descriptive text you would like to include
  in the chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the stacked bar chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, including gridlines for better readability would be helpful.

  5. I do not have any specific chart title or additional annotations in mind.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. No specific preference for the legend placement.

  8. I have no additional details or descriptive text to include.

  9. I do not have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the chart.'
