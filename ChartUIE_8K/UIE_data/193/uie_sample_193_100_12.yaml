initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the relationship between Temperature
  and Luminosity (L) of stars from the given dataset. Please make sure the Temperature
  is on the x-axis and Luminosity (L) is on the y-axis. Use different colors to represent
  different Spectral Classes for easy identification. Ensure the chart displays the
  data clearly so that trends and patterns can be easily analyzed. The context of
  this data is to understand the star classifications better, particularly focusing
  on how temperature and luminosity vary across different spectral classes.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the different Spectral Classes?

  2. Should the line chart include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Would you like to add markers to the data points on the line chart?

  4. Do you prefer any particular line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for different
  Spectral Classes?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to clearly identify the different Spectral
  Classes by color?

  6. Do you require axis labels and titles for the chart, and if so, what should they
  be?

  7. Would you like to include a chart title, and if so, what should it be?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart labels
  and legend?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. Yes, I would like to add markers to the data points on the line chart.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend to clearly identify the different Spectral
  Classes by color.

  6. Yes, please include axis labels and titles. The x-axis label should be "Temperature"
  and the y-axis label should be "Luminosity (L)".

  7. Yes, the chart title should be "Temperature vs Luminosity across Different Spectral
  Classes".

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
