initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of star classifications
  based on their Type in the provided dataset. The x-axis should represent the distinct
  star Types (0 through 5), and the y-axis should indicate the frequency of each Type.
  This chart will help in understanding the prevalence of various star types in the
  dataset. Include labels and a title "Star Type Distribution" for clarity. Thank
  you!
