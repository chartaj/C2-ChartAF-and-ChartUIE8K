  2. Would you like the chart to display exact values of average luminosity on each
  column?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  5. Is there a specific font type or size you prefer for the chart labels and title?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or callouts to highlight specific data
  points on the chart?'
