initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing star data, emphasizing Temperature,
  Luminosity (L), Radius (R), and Absolute Magnitude (A_M). Use color-coding for Spectral
  Class and highlight significant data points with annotations. The chart should aid
  in understanding star types and characteristics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the spectral classes?

  2. Would you like to specify any particular data points to be highlighted with annotations?

  3. What style or format do you prefer for the annotations of significant data points?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the axis scales (e.g., linear or logarithmic)
  for any of the attributes?

  5. Is there a specific layout or orientation for the dot plot that you prefer?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you want to include on the chart for
  better clarity?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier reference of
  data points?

  8. Is there a preferred font style or size for the labels and titles on the chart?

  9. Do you want any additional statistics or reference lines (e.g., average lines)
  to be included in the plot?

  10. Are there any other visual elements or customizations that you would like to
  include in the chart to better suit the audience?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I prefer logarithmic scales for Temperature, Luminosity, and Radius.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I would like a title like "Star Data: Temperature, Luminosity, Radius, and Absolute
  Magnitude" and axis labels for clarity.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I do not know.'
