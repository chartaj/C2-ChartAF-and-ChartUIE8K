initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the variation and distribution
  of Temperature, L, R, and A_M based on the Star Type Classification dataset from
  NASA, categorized by spectral class and star type.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include specific labels for the X and Y axes?

  3. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the boxes, especially for different
  categories?

  4. Should outliers be displayed or hidden in the box chart?

  5. Would you like to include a legend for spectral class and star type categories?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should the chart include data points overlaid on the box plots?

  8. Do you need any specific formatting for the axes, such as logarithmic scaling
  for any of the axes?

  9. Would you like to add annotations or notes on the chart to highlight key insights?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the X-axis labeled for "Spectral Class and Star Type" and the Y-axis
  labeled for each measured value like "Temperature", "L", "R", and "A_M".

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, I''d like to include a legend for spectral class and star type categories.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I do not know.'
