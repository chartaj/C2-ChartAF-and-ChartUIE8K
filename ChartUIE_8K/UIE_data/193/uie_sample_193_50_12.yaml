initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing Temperature vs Luminosity (L) for different
  Star Types. Use colors to differentiate the spectral classes.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the spectral classes?

  2. Should the chart include grid lines for easier data interpretation?

  3. Do you prefer the axes to be linear or logarithmic, especially considering the
  range of Temperature and Luminosity?

  4. Would you like data points to be marked at each position on the line chart?

  5. Should we include a legend to identify the spectral classes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on significant data points
  or trends?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart size or aspect ratio to better
  fit your presentation or publication needs?'
