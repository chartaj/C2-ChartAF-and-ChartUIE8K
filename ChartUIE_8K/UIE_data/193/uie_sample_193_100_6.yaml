initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart to visualize the star data categorized
  by "Type", displaying the normalized average of "Temperature", "L", "R", "A_M",
  "Color" (converted to numeric), and "Spectral_Class" (converted to numeric). The
  chart should illustrate how these attributes vary across different star types classified
  by NASA. Include axes for each of the star attributes, and use different color lines
  to represent each type of star. The chart will help in comparing the characteristics
  of various star types visually. Ensure all data plots are clearly visible and distinguishable.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme to be used for different
  star types?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a legend indicating the star types and their
  corresponding colors?

  3. Do you prefer a specific layout or design for the radar chart that enhances readability?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like the axes to be labeled or formatted?

  5. Should the chart include labels for the normalized average values on each axis?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the radar chart for better visualization
  of the data points?

  8. Is there a preferred order for displaying the star types or attributes on the
  chart?'
