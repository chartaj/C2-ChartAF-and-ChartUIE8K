initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the relationship between Temperature
  and Luminosity (L) from the star dataset. Use different colors for each Spectral
  Class to differentiate. Highlight trends among various Spectral Classes across temperatures.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each Spectral Class?

  2. Would you prefer to see a legend identifying the Spectral Classes, and if so,
  where should it be positioned?

  3. Should the axis labels and ticks be customized in any particular manner (e.g.,
  font size, style)?

  4. Do you have preferences for the chart title and axis titles?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the areas under the curves be filled with solid color, gradient, or patterns?

  7. Do you want any specific annotations or markers to highlight key points or ranges?

  8. Do you prefer a specific order of layers if the areas overlap (e.g., specific
  Spectral Classes to be on top)?

  9. Are there any specific range limits for either the Temperature or Luminosity
  axes that you would like to set?

  10. Do you have any particular preferences for the overall size and aspect ratio
  of the chart?'
