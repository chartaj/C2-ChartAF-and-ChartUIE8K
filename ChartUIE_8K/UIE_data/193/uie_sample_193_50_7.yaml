initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to compare the spectral class distribution
  across different star types using the data provided. Ensure each column represents
  a Star Type and segments within the column show the count of different Spectral
  Classes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or palettes for the different
  spectral classes?

  2. Are there specific labels you would like for the axes and legend?

  3. Would you like to include a title or subtitle for the chart? If so, please provide
  the text.

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text elements in the
  chart?

  5. Should there be any annotations or markers on the chart to highlight specific
  data points or categories?

  6. Would you like to display the exact count values for each segment within the
  columns?

  7. Do you have a preference for the order in which the spectral classes are stacked
  within each column?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines? If so, do you prefer major, minor, or both
  types of grid lines?'
answers: '1. I don''t know.

  2. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Star Type" and the y-axis should be labeled
  "Count of Spectral Classes". The legend should indicate the different Spectral Classes.
