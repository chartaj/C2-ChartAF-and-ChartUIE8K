02_initial_prompt: I would like a box chart that visualizes the distribution of star
  temperatures for different types listed in the dataset. Each box should represent
  the range, median, and quartiles of the temperatures for a particular star type
  (Type 0, Type 1, etc.). The chart should clearly indicate the range and outliers
  for each star type, helping to understand the variation in star temperatures across
  different types. Additionally, highlight how many unique color classifications are
  associated with each star type to see any patterns or anomalies in the data.

  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
