  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Word cloud that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Word cloud that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please generate a word cloud based on the Slogan dataset from the `199.csv` file.
  This visualization should be focused on the marketing context, highlighting the
  most frequently occurring words in the slogans of various companies. Ensure the
  word cloud clearly emphasizes the more common words, providing insight into prevalent
  themes and keywords used in company slogans. The word cloud should be visually appealing,
  with varied font sizes and colors to distinguish the frequency of words, making
  it easy to spot trends and patterns in the data.
