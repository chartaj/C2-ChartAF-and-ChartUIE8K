initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot visualizing election results data. Plot the
  percentage votes of each party (CON, LAB, LIB, Green, etc.) on the x-axis and constituencies
  on the y-axis. Include text annotations highlighting the top three constituencies
  with the highest votes for each major party. Use different colors to represent each
  party to ensure visual distinction and emphasis. Adding highlights for the winning
  party in each constituency will help to emphasize the election outcomes. The visualization
  should facilitate analyzing voting patterns across different regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing each party?

  2. Are there any specific colors you want to use for certain parties?

  3. Would you like the dot sizes to vary based on the percentage of votes, or should
  they remain uniform?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the text annotations
  highlighting the top constituencies?

  5. How would you like the winning party highlights to be displayed (e.g., bold outline,
  different shape, larger size)?

  6. Do you have any preference for the ordering of constituencies on the y-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by percentage of votes for a specific party)?

  7. Are there specific labels or legends you want to include to enhance the readability
  of the chart?

  8. Would you prefer any additional gridlines or background elements to help interpret
  the data?'
