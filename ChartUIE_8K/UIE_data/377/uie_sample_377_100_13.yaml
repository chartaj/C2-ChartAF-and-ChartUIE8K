initial_prompt: Can you create a bar chart to visualize the election results? Specifically,
  I want to see the percentage votes for CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, and Green parties
  across the provided sample constituencies (Aldershot, Aldridge-Brownhills, Altrincham
  and Sale West). Each constituency should be a separate group of bars, with different
  colors representing the different parties. The Y-axis should show the percentage
  votes, and the X-axis should list the constituencies. Please label each bar with
  the percentage it represents.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the parties (e.g., specific
  shades for CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, and Green)?

  2. What should be the order of the parties within each constituency group (e.g.,
  CON first, LAB second)?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for labels and axis titles?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for better readability
  of percentages?

  5. Do you want to include a legend specifying the parties with their corresponding
  colors?

  6. How would you like the data labels formatted (e.g., with percentage signs, decimal
  places)?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or comments on specific
  bars or groups of bars?

  9. Are there any constraints on the dimensions or layout of the chart (e.g., width,
  height, aspect ratio)?

  10. How would you like to handle null or zero values in the data (e.g., exclude
  them, display as zero)?'
