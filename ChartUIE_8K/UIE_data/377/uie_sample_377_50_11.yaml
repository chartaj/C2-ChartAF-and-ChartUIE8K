initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing voting percentages. Each group
  should represent different constituencies, with bars for CON(%), LAB(%), and LIB(%).
  Label the x-axis with constituency names and the y-axis with percentages. The chart
  should clearly distinguish between constituencies using color codes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for specific color codes for the different
  constituencies or the party bars (CON, LAB, LIB)?

  2. Would you like to include any specific title for the chart?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be included in the background of the chart for better
  readability of the bars'' values?

  4. Should there be data labels directly on or above the bars indicating their percentage
  values?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size of the chart labels (x-axis,
  y-axis, and legend)?

  6. Would you like the chart to include a legend indicating what each color represents?

  7. Is there a particular order you would like the constituencies to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically, by percentage value of a specific party)?

  8. Any preference on the width of the bars or the spacing between groups of bars?

  9. Would you like the y-axis to have a fixed range (e.g., from 0% to 100%) or should
  it auto-adjust based on the data?'
