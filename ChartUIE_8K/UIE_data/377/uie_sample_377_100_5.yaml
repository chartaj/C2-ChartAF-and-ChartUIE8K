initial_prompt: Please create a table chart visualizing the election data for different
  constituencies. Include columns for Constituency Name, MP, Area, County, Electorate,
  Votes for each party (CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, NAT, MIN, OTH), percentage of
  votes for each party, and the winning party. Ensure the chart is clear and easy
  to read, with each row representing a different constituency. Highlight the winning
  party for each row. This will help in understanding the election results and the
  distribution of votes among different parties.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used in the
  chart?

  2. Would you prefer the winning party to be highlighted with a specific color or
  style?

  3. Should we include any additional visual indicators (such as icons) for the winning
  party?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the table?

  5. Should the columns be arranged in a specific order, or is the default order acceptable?

  6. Do you wish to include any additional information or annotations in the chart?

  7. Is there a specific format you would like for the percentages (e.g., one decimal
  place, two decimal places)?

  8. Would you like to include sorting options for any of the columns (e.g., sorting
  by electorate size, votes for a specific party)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the width or spacing of columns to ensure readability?

  10. Should any specific columns be fixed or frozen for easier navigation?'
