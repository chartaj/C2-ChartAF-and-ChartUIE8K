initial_prompt: Create a tile map visualizing election results across different constituencies.
  Each tile represents a constituency, color-coded by the winning party (e.g., blue
  for CON, red for LAB). Include additional data layers showing vote percentages for
  CON, LAB, and LIB. Tiles should be sized or shaded to reflect electorate size or
  voter turnout. Integrate dropdown filters to view results by specific areas, counties,
  and parties. Use hover information to display detailed results for each constituency,
  such as MP name, electorate, and vote breakdown. This will effectively showcase
  regional voting patterns and outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the winning parties?

  2. How would you like to represent electorate size or voter turnout with tiles (e.g.,
  size, shading, or both)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the layout and design of the dropdown
  filters?

  4. What level of detail would you like to see in the hover information for each
  constituency?

  5. Are there any specific label or formatting preferences for constituency names
  and MP names?

  6. Would you prefer any specific map projection or geographic layout?

  7. How many categories, like areas or counties, would you like included in the dropdown
  filters?'
answers: '1. For the color scheme, I prefer blue for CON and red for LAB, but I am
  not sure about the others.

  2. I would like to represent electorate size or voter turnout with both size and
  shading.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I would like to see MP name, electorate size, and a detailed vote breakdown in
  the hover information.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure about any specific map projection or geographic layout.

  7. I am not sure; just include a reasonable number based on standard practices.'
