initial_prompt: 'Please create a stacked column chart to visualize election results
  from the CSV data provided. Each column should represent a constituency (e.g., Aldershot,
  Aldridge-Brownhills) and be broken down into segments showing the percentage votes
  for each party: CON, LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, NAT, MIN, and OTH. The y-axis should
  represent the percentage of the vote, and the x-axis should list the names of the
  constituencies. Ensure each party has a unique color for easy differentiation. The
  chart should clearly indicate which party won in each constituency. This helps analyze
  voting patterns.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette for the different parties?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart to improve readability?

  3. Do you want to add labels for the percentage values on each segment of the columns?

  4. Should the chart include a legend indicating which color corresponds to which
  party?

  5. Do you have a specific format or style preference for the x-axis and y-axis labels
  (e.g., font size, font type)?

  6. Are there any particular constituencies you would like to highlight or emphasize?

  7. Would you prefer a specific order for constituencies on the x-axis, such as alphabetical
  or by a particular metric (e.g., winning party)?

  8. Is there any additional information you want to display on the chart, such as
  total votes for each constituency?

  9. Do you want to include any annotations or notes within the chart to explain specific
  data points?'
