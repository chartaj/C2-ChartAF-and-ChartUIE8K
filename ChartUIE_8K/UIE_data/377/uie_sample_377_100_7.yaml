initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the election data. Specifically,
  I am interested in seeing the distribution of votes among different parties (CON,
  LAB, LIB, Brexit, Green, NAT, MIN, OTH) for each of the listed constituencies (e.g.,
  Aldershot, Aldridge-Brownhills, Altrincham, and Sale West). The chart should show
  the percentage of total votes each party received in each constituency. Ensure the
  chart is clear, labeled, and easy to read, with a legend to differentiate the parties.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party in the pie
  chart?

  2. Would you like the percentages displayed directly on the pie chart slices?

  3. Do you prefer the pie chart to be displayed in 2D or 3D?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Should the chart include any titles or subtitles, and if so, what should they
  be?

  6. Do you want the constituencies to be displayed together in a single chart or
  separately as individual pie charts?

  7. Is there a particular order in which you want the parties to be displayed in
  the legend?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or descriptions on the chart?'
