initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing movies available on Netflix, Prime Video,
  Hulu, and Disney+. Please create a line chart that shows the distribution of movie
  releases over the years across the four platforms. Use different lines for each
  platform (Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Disney+). I want to see the trends and how
  the availability of movies has changed over the years on each platform. The x-axis
  should represent the years, and the y-axis should indicate the number of movies
  released. This will help visualize which platform had the most movie releases year
  over year.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  each platform?

  2. Would you like to include any data labels on the line chart (e.g., values at
  each data point)?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines to enhance readability?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the platforms, and
  if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you''d like for the axes labels and
  title?

  7. Do you want to highlight any particular years or data points on the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis start at zero, or do you prefer a different baseline?

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or comments to specific parts of the chart?'
