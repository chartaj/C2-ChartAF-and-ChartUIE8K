  1. Netflix could be red, Hulu green, Prime Video blue, and Disney+ purple.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  3. I am not sure, maybe use bold text or a different color for the critical data
  points?

  4. I do not know, as long as the information is clear.

  5. The title could be "Movie Distribution Across Streaming Platforms," and axis
  labels could be "Streaming Platforms" for the x-axis and "Number of Movies" for
  the y-axis.

  6. I do not have any specific guidelines.

  7. Data values could be displayed on the bars if it looks good.

  8. I do not know, whatever makes the data most clear.
