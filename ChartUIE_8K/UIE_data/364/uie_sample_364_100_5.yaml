initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart comparing the number of movies available
  on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and Disney+. The chart should show how many movies
  each streaming service has, based on the data provided. For each service, I'd like
  the bar to be color-coded differently for clear comparison. Also, please highlight
  the range of Rotten Tomatoes scores for these movies by overlaying another set of
  bars or annotations indicating the score distribution for each service. This will
  help understand not just availability, but quality of movies on each platform.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing each
  streaming service?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  3. For highlighting the range of Rotten Tomatoes scores, do you prefer using annotations,
  overlay bars, or another method?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the bars for Rotten Tomatoes
  scores?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  6. Would you like any gridlines or background colors to enhance the readability
  of the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the streaming services to be displayed on
  the chart?'
