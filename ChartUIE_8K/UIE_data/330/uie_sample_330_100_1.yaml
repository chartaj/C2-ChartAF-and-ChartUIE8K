initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart using the provided bioinformatics dataset.
  The x-axis should represent the 'time' column and the y-axis will have values from
  columns '40' to '260'. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight key data points
  for specific 'time' entries, drawing attention to trends and significant changes.
  Emphasize important values with highlights to make these points stand out. This
  visualization should help in understanding protein dynamics over time, with added
  annotations providing insights or notes about specific changes or patterns in the
  data.
questions: '1. What color scheme or palette do you prefer for the line chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style of line (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  background)?

  4. Do you have a preference for where the annotations should be placed relative
  to the key data points (e.g., above, below, next to)?

  5. What format or markers would you like to use for highlighting important values
  (e.g., circles, squares, stars)?

  6. Is there a specific width and height you prefer for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines to help interpret the data more easily?

  8. Are there any specific ''time'' entries you want to ensure are annotated?

  9. Do you have a preference for the labels and titles of the x-axis and y-axis?

  10. Would you prefer a legend to differentiate between the different columns on
  the y-axis? If so, how should it be styled?'
