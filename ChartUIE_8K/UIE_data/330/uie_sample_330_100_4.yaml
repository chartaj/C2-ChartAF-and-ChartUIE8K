initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the essential biology dataset in a scatter plot
  with time on the x-axis and the expression levels from 40 to 260 on the y-axis.
  Each point should represent a different gene (e.g., YAL001C, YAL014C). Color-code
  the points based on their expression levels at each time point. Make sure the scatter
  plot clearly differentiates between the various data points. This will help analyze
  the trends and variations in gene expression over time. Include a legend to explain
  the time points and data sets for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used for the
  color-coding of the points?

  2. Are there any specific genes that you would like to highlight or differentiate
  from the others?

  3. Do you prefer any specific markers or shapes (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)
  for the scatter plot points?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines for easier visualization of data points?

  5. Do you have a preferred scale (linear or logarithmic) for the y-axis representing
  expression levels?

  6. Are there any specific time intervals you want to be emphasized on the x-axis?

  7. Do you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific font or style you would like to use for the labels and title
  of the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels for certain data
  points on the scatter plot?

  10. Are there any other specific features or details you would like to include in
  the scatter plot to help in analyzing the trends and variations in gene expression?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Circles would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include gridlines.

  5. Linear scale is preferred.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. No specific preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
