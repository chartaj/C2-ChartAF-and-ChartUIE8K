initial_prompt: I have a bioinformatics dataset highlighting protein activities at
  different times. Can you create a heatmap showing the protein expression levels
  over time, using the time points (time column) and the corresponding data values
  (40 to 260 columns)? The heatmap should display color gradients representing expression
  levels, with distinct colors for low, medium, and high values. Ensure it's easy
  to interpret differences at each time point. Visual clarity is essential, as this
  will help in understanding protein behavior. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. How many distinct color ranges would you like for the low, medium, and high expression
  levels?

  3. Should the heatmap display a legend for the color gradient?

  4. Do you have a specific labeling style for the time points on the axis?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the heatmap for better readability?

  6. What level of opacity/transparency do you prefer for the color gradients?

  7. Should the heatmap include annotations for specific data points?

  8. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  9. Is there a particular range of expression levels that should be highlighted or
  focused on?

  10. Do you prefer the heatmap to have a title and subtitle? If yes, what should
  they be?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Three distinct color ranges for low, medium, and high would be good.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should display a legend for the color gradient.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, grid lines would help with readability.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, the title should be "Protein Expression Levels Over Time" and no subtitle
  is needed.
