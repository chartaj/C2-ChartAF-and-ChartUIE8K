initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the protein levels over time for the
  sample data. Highlight significant peaks and troughs with annotations to emphasize
  these points. This will help in identifying crucial protein expression trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the peaks and troughs to be highlighted with specific colors or
  shapes?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units?

  5. Do you need a legend to differentiate between different time series or samples?

  6. What level of granularity would you like for the time intervals on the x-axis?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like for the chart?

  8. What chart dimensions (width and height) do you prefer?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please use different colors or shapes for peaks and troughs.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The x-axis should be labeled "Time" and the y-axis should be labeled "Protein
  Levels".

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.'
