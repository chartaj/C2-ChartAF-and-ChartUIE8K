  Each point should represent a different gene (e.g., YAL001C, YAL014C). Color-code
  the points based on their expression levels at each time point. Make sure the scatter
  plot clearly differentiates between the various data points. This will help analyze
  the trends and variations in gene expression over time. Include a legend to explain
  the time points and data sets for clarity.
