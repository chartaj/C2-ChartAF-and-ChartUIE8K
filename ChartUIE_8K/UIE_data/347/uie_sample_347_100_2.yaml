initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to compare the top-selling video games by their
  global sales, highlighting the genre and platform. Annotate the top three games
  with their names and global sales values. Use different colors for each genre to
  visually distinguish them. The primary goal is to identify trends in genre popularity
  and top performing platforms. Add a brief summary that highlights the significance
  of critc scores and user ratings, focusing on games with both high sales and high
  ratings for a richer understanding of their success in the market.

  \ clustered, stacked)?\n7. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should\
  \ it be placed?\n8. How should platforms be indicated in the bar chart (e.g., by\
  \ using different shades, patterns, or icons)?\n9. Do you want any specific background\
  \ color or gridlines in the chart?\n10. Should the summary of critic scores and\
