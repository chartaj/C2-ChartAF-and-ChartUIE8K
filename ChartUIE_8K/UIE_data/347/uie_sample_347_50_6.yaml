initial_prompt: Create a treemap showing the distribution of global sales across different
  genres and platforms. Use colors to differentiate genres and sub-divide by platforms.
  The size of each block should reflect the Global_Sales value.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating genres?

  2. How would you like to handle platforms within genres? Should they be distinctly
  labeled or visually separated in a specific way?

  3. Would you prefer the genre labels to be inside the blocks, outside, or does it
  not matter?

  4. Do you want the platform labels to be nested within the respective genre blocks
  or as separate annotations?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the genres or platforms to be displayed
  in (e.g., alphabetical, by sales volume)?

  6. Are there any specific genres or platforms you would like to highlight or emphasize?

  7. What level of detail do you prefer for the block labels (e.g., exact sales values,
  percentage of total sales)?

  8. Do you want a legend to explain the color-coding of genres, or is it sufficient
  for the colors to be intuitively understood?'
