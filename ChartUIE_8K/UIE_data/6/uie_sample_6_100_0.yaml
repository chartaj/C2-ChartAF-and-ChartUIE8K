initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing maize yield over the years for different
  countries. Highlight the trends and variations, especially focusing on countries
  with significant changes. Use data annotations to mark crucial points or anomalies
  in the data. This visualization should help in understanding agricultural trends
  over centuries and identifying periods of high or low productivity. It's essential
  for analyzing how different factors have influenced crop yields historically and
  could assist researchers or policymakers in making data-driven decisions for future
  agriculture practices. The chart should be clear, informative, and visually engaging
  for stakeholders.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different countries being
  plotted on the line chart?

  2. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for annotations and labels?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart? If so, should they be major
  gridlines, minor gridlines, or both?

  5. Do you have a preferred style for highlighting significant changes or trends
  (e.g., color changes, line thickness, markers)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to identify the different countries? If so,
  do you have a preferred position for the legend?

  7. Do you want to include any descriptive text or captions within the chart to provide
  context?

  8. Are there any specific crucial points or anomalies you already know and want
  highlighted with annotations?

  9. Would you like to set a specific range for the y-axis to focus on certain yield
  values?

  10. Do you have any preference for the format or styling of the annotations marking
  crucial points or anomalies (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?'
answers: "1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the countries being\
  \ plotted. \n2. The x-axis should be labeled \"Year\" and the y-axis should be labeled\
  \ \"Maize Yield (tons per hectare)\".\n3. I am not sure about the preferred font\
  \ style or size for annotations and labels.\n4. Yes, include gridlines. Major gridlines\
  \ would be preferred.\n5. I would prefer using markers to highlight significant\
  \ changes or trends.\n6. Yes, the chart should include a legend, and it would be\
  \ best positioned at the bottom right corner.\n7. I have no specific preference.\n\
  8. I do not know of any specific crucial points or anomalies that need highlighting.\n\
  9. I have no specific preference for the range setting for the y-axis.\n10. I have\
  \ no specific preference for the format or styling of the annotations marking crucial\
  \ points or anomalies."
