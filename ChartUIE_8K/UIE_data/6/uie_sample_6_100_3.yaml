initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes maize yield by country and year.
  The dataset shows maize yield from 1275 to 1355 for countries like the United Kingdom.
  I'd like the heatmap to display countries on the y-axis and years on the x-axis,
  with the intensity of color representing maize yield values. Missing data should
  be highlighted, and a legend should explain color intensity. This visualization
  will help understand agricultural trends and yield variations across different countries
  and years for maize cultivation. Make sure the heatmap is easy to read with clear
  labels and legends.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. What range of colors would you prefer for representing maize yield values?

  3. How would you like missing data to be highlighted on the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and legends?

  5. Would you like any additional annotations on the heatmap to highlight specific
  trends or patterns?

  6. Is there a specific way you''d like the countries to be ordered on the y-axis?

  7. Are there any specific countries that should be emphasized or prioritized in
  the heatmap?'
