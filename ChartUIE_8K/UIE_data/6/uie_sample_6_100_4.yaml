initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the maize yield over the years in
  different countries. Use the data from the provided dataset, focusing on the unique
  values for countries, years, and maize yield. The x-axis should represent the years,
  and the y-axis should show the maize yield. Each bar should correspond to a different
  country, allowing for an easy comparison of maize production trends over time. This
  will help understand the historical maize yields in various countries, crucial for
  insights into agriculture and farming practices' impact on the world's wildlife.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars representing different
  countries?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  3. Do you prefer the years on the x-axis to be rotated or displayed vertically for
  better readability?

  4. Should there be a legend to differentiate between countries, or do you prefer
  labeling each bar directly?

  5. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Would you like to include data labels on each bar to show the exact maize yield
  values?

  7. Should the chart include annotations or markers to highlight significant trends
  or changes in maize yields?

  8. Do you prefer a specific ordering of the countries (e.g., alphabetical, by yield,
  etc.)?

  9. Would you like to add a subtitle or description to provide additional context
  to the chart?'
