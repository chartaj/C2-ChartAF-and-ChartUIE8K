initial_prompt: Please create a Treemap visuals data on maize yield across different
  countries and years. Highlight the missing values distinctly. Also, categorize yield
  data based on country codes to show disparities explicitly. Include prominent years
  focusing on the highest and lowest yields in the dataset. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or palettes for distinguishing
  different countries or country codes?

  2. How would you like the highest and lowest yield years to be highlighted within
  the Treemap (e.g., specific colors, labels, or borders)?

  3. What specific color or style would you prefer for highlighting missing values
  in the Treemap?

  4. Is there any particular font style or size you would prefer for labels and annotations
  within the Treemap?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or key to explain the color coding and symbols
  used in the Treemap?'
