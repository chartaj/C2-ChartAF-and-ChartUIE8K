initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that shows the average points earned per
  match by each Bundesliga team throughout the season. Use the data to plot each teamâ€™s
  progress over time, with the x-axis representing the match dates and the y-axis
  representing the average points per match. Highlight trends and any notable peaks
  or dips in performance. Ensure that each team is clearly distinguishable with different
  colors or line styles. Include axis labels, legends, and a title for clarity. Focus
  on making the chart readable and informative. Thanks!

  2. Should specific teams have dedicated colors or line styles?

  3. Would you prefer solid lines, dashed lines, or a mix for different teams?

  4. How would you like the axis labels formatted (e.g., date format for the x-axis)?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  7. Are there specific milestones or events during the season that should be annotated
  on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the labels and
  titles?

  or specific matches)?'
