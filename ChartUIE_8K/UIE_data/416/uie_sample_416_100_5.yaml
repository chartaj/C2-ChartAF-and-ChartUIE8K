initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of Full Time Home
  Goals (FTHG) and Full Time Away Goals (FTAG) in the Bundesliga. The x-axis should
  represent the number of goals scored, and the y-axis should represent the frequency
  of matches with that number of goals. Separate the data into two histograms: one
  for home goals and one for away goals, side by side for easy comparison. Make sure
  to include appropriate labels and a title: "Distribution of Home and Away Goals
  in Bundesliga Matches".'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color of the histograms
  for home and away goals?

  2. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and title?

  3. Do you want the bins in the histogram to have a fixed width, or should they be
  dynamically determined based on the data?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the background of the histogram for
  better readability?

  5. Do you prefer the side-by-side histograms to be stacked or displayed separately
  next to each other?

  in the chart?

  7. Do you want any specific legend placement or style for the histograms?'
