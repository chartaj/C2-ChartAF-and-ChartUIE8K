initial_prompt: I have data for Bundesliga points per match from a CSV file with detailed
  betting odds and match statistics. I want to visualize this data using a box chart.
  The box chart should show the distribution of points earned per match by different
  teams. Use "HomeTeam," "AwayTeam," "FTHG" (Full-Time Home Goals), and "FTAG" (Full-Time
  Away Goals) columns to calculate the points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, and 0 for
  a loss). The x-axis should represent teams, and the y-axis should represent points
  per match. Each box should summarize the points distribution for each team.
questions: "1. Do you have specific color preferences for different teams?\n2. Would\
  \ you like to display the median, quartiles, and/or outliers explicitly on the box\
  \ chart?\n3. Do you have specific labeling preferences for the x-axis (team names)?\n\
  4. Should the chart title be included? If yes, do you have a preferred title?\n\
  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed for easier comparison across teams?\n6.\
  \ Would you prefer any specific font sizes or styles for the labels and title?\n\
  7. Do you have any preferences for axis scale ranges or should it be auto-calculated?\
  \ \n8. Should the box widths be uniform or reflect the number of matches played\
  \ by each team?\n9. Do you want to include any annotations or specific markers for\
  \ average points or other statistics?\n10. Are there any specific teams that you\
  \ would like to highlight or emphasize in the chart?"
