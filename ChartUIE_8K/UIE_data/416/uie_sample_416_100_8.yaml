initial_prompt: I want to create a bubble chart visualizing the Bundesliga points
  per match. Use the columns 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'FTHG' (Full Time Home Goals),
  'FTAG' (Full Time Away Goals), 'HS' (Home Shots), and 'AS' (Away Shots) from the
  provided data. On the x-axis, plot the 'HomeTeam', and on the y-axis, plot the 'AwayTeam'.
  The size of the bubbles should represent the total goals scored (FTHG + FTAG), and
  the color should represent the difference in shots (HS - AS). This will help compare
  teams based on their goals and shooting statistics. Use distinct colors for positive
  and negative differences in shots.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubbles representing the
  difference in shots?

  2. Do you want to include specific labels for each bubble, such as the total goals
  scored or team names?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size range of the bubbles?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding of the shot differences?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better reference, or should they be minimal?

  6. Is there a specific order in which the teams should be plotted on the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  7. Do you want to emphasize any particular team or match with a distinct visual
  element?'
