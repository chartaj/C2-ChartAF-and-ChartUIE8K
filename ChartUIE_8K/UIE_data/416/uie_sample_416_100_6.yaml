initial_prompt: 'Create an area chart to visualize Bundesliga points per match. Use
  data from ''416.csv'', focusing on columns: Date, HomeTeam, AwayTeam, FTHG, FTAG.
  The x-axis should represent match dates, while the y-axis shows cumulative points.
  HomeTeam and AwayTeam should be differentiated by colors. For home teams, add 3
  points for a win, 1 for a draw. For away teams, do the same. Stack the areas for
  visual comparison. Ensure the chart includes a legend for clarity. This will help
  compare team performances over time.'
