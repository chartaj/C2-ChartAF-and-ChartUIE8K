initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to Bundesliga points per match, including
  game details like dates, teams, scores, and betting odds. I'd like to create a heatmap.
  The y-axis should list all the teams, and the x-axis should represent different
  match dates. The heatmap should display the points each team earned for those matches
  in vibrant color gradients. Zero points should be in lighter shades, while higher
  points in darker shades to easily see which teams performed well over the season.
  Use the 'HomeTeam', 'AwayTeam', 'Date', 'FTHG', 'FTAG', 'FTR' columns for this.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Do you prefer the heatmap to be in a horizontal or vertical layout?

  3. What font styles and sizes do you prefer for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be present on the heatmap for better readability?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the margins, paddings, and overall spacing
  of the heatmap?

  6. Should we use any specific annotations or labels for important dates or matches?

  7. Do you have a preferred aspect ratio or size for the heatmap?

  8. Are there any particular highlights or markers you would like to include for
  exceptional performances or key matches?

  9. Do you have a preferred method for calculating and displaying the points (e.g.,
  exact points or normalized values)?

  10. Would you like any additional statistical summaries or legends to be included
  on the heatmap?
