initial_prompt: I need a donut chart to visualize the distribution of students' reasons
  for choosing their school (the "reason" column). The chart should show proportions
  for each unique reason (course, home, other, reputation). Make the segments distinct
  with different colors. Title the chart "Reasons for Choosing School" and provide
  percentages for each segment. Use data from the "reason" column in the provided
  dataset. Ensure the chart legend is clear and easily readable. This will help understand
  the main factors influencing school choice among students.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each segment of the
  donut chart?

  2. Is there a preferred font style or size that you would like for the chart title
  and legend?

  3. Would you like to see the exact percentage values inside each segment or just
  in the legend?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for the segments (e.g., alphabetical or by proportion)?

  5. Should the chart include labels directly on each segment or just in the legend?

  6. Is there any specific background color or style you prefer for the chart area?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I would like to see the exact percentage values inside each segment.

  4. Alphabetical order would be good.

  5. Include labels directly on each segment.

  6. I do not know.'
