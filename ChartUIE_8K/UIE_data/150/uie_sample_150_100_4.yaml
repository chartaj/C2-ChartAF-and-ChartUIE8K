initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize student performance data
  from the dataset. Each column should represent a student's unique identifier. Stack
  different colors to show their grades (G1, G2, and G3) on top of each other for
  better comparison. Ensure each color segment in the column indicates a specific
  grade component. Use different shades to differentiate between G1, G2, and G3 grades
  within each column. Label the x-axis with student IDs and the y-axis with grade
  values to show their overall performance. The chart should help understand grade
  distributions and patterns among students.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette for differentiating between
  G1, G2, and G3 grades?

  2. Do you want specific labels or annotations on each segment of the stacked columns?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding for the grades?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the axis labels and
  titles?

  5. Is there a specific order in which student IDs should be arranged on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical, by performance)?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better visual reference of grade values?

  7. Are there any specific visual styles or themes (e.g., modern, classic) that you
  prefer for the overall look of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  6. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart for better visual reference of grade
  values.

  7. I have no specific preference for the visual styles or themes.'
