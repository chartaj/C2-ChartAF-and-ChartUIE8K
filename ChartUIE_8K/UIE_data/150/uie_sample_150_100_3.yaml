initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize student performance based
  on their final grades (G1, G2, G3) segmented by gender (sex). Use the 'G1', 'G2',
  and 'G3' columns to depict the grades and group them by the 'sex' column to distinguish
  between male and female student performance. Include labels for each bar to represent
  the average grades for males and females across the three grading periods. Use different
  colors to differentiate the grades (G1, G2, G3) and include a legend. Title the
  chart "Student Performance by Gender."
