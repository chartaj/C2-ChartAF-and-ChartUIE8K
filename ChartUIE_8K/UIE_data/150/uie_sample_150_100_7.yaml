initial_prompt: I'd like to create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  students' study time and their final grade (G3). Use 'studytime' for the x-axis
  and 'G3' for the y-axis. Differentiate the data points using the 'sex' column to
  see if there are any trends based on gender. Additionally, use different markers
  or colors for each gender to distinguish them clearly. Make sure the chart has appropriate
  labels, a legend, and a title to make it easy to understand the data being presented.
questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for different genders?

  2. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  3. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the scatter plot?

  5. What style of markers would you prefer for each gender?

  6. Do you want trend lines or regression lines added for each gender?

  7. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style or size for labels and
  title?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific colors in mind.

  2. I am not sure, a relevant and descriptive title would be fine.

  3. The x-axis should be labeled "Study Time" and the y-axis should be labeled "Final
  Grade (G3)".

  4. Yes, I would like grid lines on the scatter plot.

  5. I do not know, as long as they are distinguishable.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for the legend positioning.

  8. I do not know, default font style and size are fine.'
