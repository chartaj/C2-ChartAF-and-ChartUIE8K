initial_prompt: I have a dataset about student performance that includes variables
  like school, age, family size, parental education, support received, and grades.
  I'd like a histogram showing the distribution of final grades (G3). This will help
  visualize how students are performing overall. Additionally, if possible, include
  separate histograms comparing male and female students' grades. This should provide
  insights into any potential performance differences based on gender. Use different
  colors for each gender to make the comparison easy to understand. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating male and female
  students'' grades?

  2. What title would you like to appear on the histogram?

  3. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the histogram?

  4. Should the histograms for male and female students be displayed side-by-side,
  overlaid, or on separate axes?

  5. Do you prefer any specific bin sizes for the histograms?

  6. Should there be any specific legends or keys included in the visualization?

  7. Is there any particular font or style you would like for the chart''s text and
  labels?

  8. Do you have any preference for the axis scaling or specific ranges for the grade
  distributions?'
