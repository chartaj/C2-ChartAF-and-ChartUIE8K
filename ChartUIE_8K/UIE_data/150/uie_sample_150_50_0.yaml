initial_prompt: Create a dot plot to visualize the correlation between studytime and
  G3 grades among students. Highlight students with high G3 grades using different
  colors. Annotate significant data points, such as students with maximal G3 grades.
  This will help educators identify patterns and the impact of study time on academic
  performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting students with
  high G3 grades?

  2. Would you like to use specific shapes or sizes for the dots to represent different
  data points?

  3. How many highest G3 grades would you like to highlight and annotate on the plot?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout or style of annotations for significant
  data points?

  5. Is there a specific range or threshold for what you consider as ''high'' G3 grades?

  6. Do you prefer a specific background style or grid layout for the dot plot?

  7. Should the dot plot include axis labels and legends, and if so, do you have preferences
  for their titles or positions?

  8. Would you like any additional context or notes to be included within the plot?'

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I would like the top 5 highest G3 grades to be highlighted and annotated.
