initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing student performance over three grading
  periods (G1, G2, G3) with each line representing different schools or genders. Annotate
  notable trends like consistent improvement or decline in grades. Highlight points
  where health, absences, or study time correlate strongly with performance changes.
  This visualization should help identify patterns and factors affecting student success
  and guide educational improvements. Utilize text annotations to emphasize key data
  points and highlights to distinguish trends among groups. Consider both continuous
  grades and categorical variables like parental education or internet access in the
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the lines representing different
  schools or genders?

  2. How would you like the annotation text to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  bold)?

  3. Do you have a preference for how trends are highlighted (e.g., shaded areas,
  bold lines, markers)?

  4. Would you like any specific markers for key data points, such as circles or squares?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like correlations (health, absences, study
  time) to be indicated (e.g., arrows, different line styles)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you prefer for distinguishing the different
  groups?

  7. Do you have a preference for the format of the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Would you like any specific background or grid style for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I would like markers to highlight trends.

  4. I prefer circles for key data points.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. I prefer the x-axis labeled with the grading periods (G1, G2, G3) and the y-axis
  labeled with grades.

  8. I do not know.'
