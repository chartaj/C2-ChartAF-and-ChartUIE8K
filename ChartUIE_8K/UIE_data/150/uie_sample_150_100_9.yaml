initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualizing the distribution of final grades
  (G3) according to the parental education levels (Medu and Fedu) from the Student
  Performance Data Set. The x-axis should represent the various education levels of
  the mother (Medu) and father (Fedu), and the y-axis should represent the final grades
  (G3). The plot should include all unique values of Medu and Fedu. This will help
  visualize how parental education levels influence student performance. Ensure that
  any outliers are clearly marked on the box plot. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box plot?

  2. Would you like the box plot to display median lines in a specific color?

  3. Should the x-axis categories for the education levels (Medu and Fedu) be displayed
  in a specific order?

  4. Would you prefer vertical or horizontal orientation for the box plot?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like to differentiate between mother''s education
  levels (Medu) and father''s education levels (Fedu) in the box plot?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include in the box
  plot?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis titles and labels?

  8. Would you like the plot gridlines to be displayed in a particular way or color?
