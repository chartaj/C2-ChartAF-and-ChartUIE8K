initial_prompt: Visualize the Body Fat Prediction dataset using a line chart. Highlight
  key columns such as 'BodyFat', 'Age', 'Weight', and 'Height' to emphasize their
  relationships over individuals. Add text annotations to display exact values of
  'BodyFat' at significant points on the line chart to draw attention. The purpose
  is to help comprehend how body fat correlates with other variables. This visualization
  will aid in understanding health patterns in individuals. Ensure the chart is clear
  with a legend for easier interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like different line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for each variable
  to distinguish them better?

  3. How would you like significant points to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  larger marker)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations displaying
  ''BodyFat'' values?

  5. Are there any specific intervals at which you would like the annotations to be
  placed on the line chart?

  6. What kind of marker shapes do you prefer for the data points (e.g., circles,
  squares)?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s title or axis labels in terms of
  wording or formatting?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the variables (Age, Weight, and Height)
  to be displayed in the legend?

  10. Would you like to include any trend lines or regression lines to emphasize the
  relationships more clearly?'
