initial_prompt: Please create a set of small multiples charts for the 'Body Fat Prediction
  Dataset'. I want to see scatter plots comparing 'BodyFat' with each of the other
  columns like 'Density', 'Age', 'Weight', etc. Each plot should show individual data
  points, helping to identify any correlations between 'BodyFat' and these variables.
  Additionally, include gridlines for better readability. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the scatter plots?

  2. Would you like to include a trendline in the scatter plots to help identify correlations?

  3. Do you prefer a particular shape or size for the individual data points?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you would like the variables to be displayed?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels or titles for each of the scatter
  plots?

  6. Are there any specific gridline styles or densities you prefer for better readability?

  7. Do you want the same axis scales across all scatter plots, or should each plot
  be scaled independently based on the data range?

  8. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for specific data points
  in the scatter plots?

  9. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the text in the charts?

  10. Is there a specific chart background color or theme that you would like to be
  applied?'
