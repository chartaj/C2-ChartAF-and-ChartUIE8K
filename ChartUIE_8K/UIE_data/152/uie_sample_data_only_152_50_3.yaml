  8. Do you want legends to describe each age group, or is it sufficient to have them
  on the x-axis?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for clarity in the charts?

  10. Would you like to normalize the data (e.g., z-scores) for better comparison?

  11. How detailed should the axis labels be? (e.g., just ''Weight'' or ''Average

  12. Do you have a preferred title format and subtitle for each of the small multiples?

  13. Should each chart have the same y-axis scale, or should it be auto-adjusted
