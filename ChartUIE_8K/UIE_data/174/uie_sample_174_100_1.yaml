initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the "Music & Mental Health Survey Results"
  data. Plot 'Hours per day' on the x-axis and 'Anxiety' on the y-axis. Use text annotations
  to display values of data points where 'Anxiety' is greater than 5. Highlight points
  where 'Primary streaming service' is 'Spotify'. This visualization aims to explore
  the relationship between the amount of time spent listening to music daily and anxiety
  levels, focusing on Spotify users. The data will help identify patterns or potential
  correlations for further analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the highlighted points (Spotify users) to be visually differentiated
  (e.g., different color, shape, size)?

  3. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the text annotations on points
  with ''Anxiety'' greater than 5?

  4. Would you like to add gridlines to the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer any specific labeling or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Is there a specific font or font size that you prefer for the chart labels and
  annotations?

  7. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines (e.g., average anxiety level, average
  listening time)?

  9. Should the chart include axis tick marks or customized intervals for better visualization?'
