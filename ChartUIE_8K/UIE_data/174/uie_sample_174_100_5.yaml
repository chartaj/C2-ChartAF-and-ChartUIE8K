initial_prompt: Please create a line chart from the "Music & Mental Health Survey
  Results" dataset. The chart should show the relationship between Age and the average
  Hours per day spent on the primary streaming service. Additionally, plot separate
  lines to represent the average values for Anxiety, Depression, Insomnia, and OCD
  scores across different age groups. This will help in visualizing how streaming
  habits correlate with various mental health measures as age varies. Use different
  colors for each mental health metric for clarity. Make sure to label the axes appropriately.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  the different mental health metrics?

  2. Are there specific age group intervals you would like for grouping the data (e.g.,
  every 5 years, every 10 years)?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend indicating what each line and color
  represents?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines to make it easier to read values?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the axes to be labeled (e.g., "Age (years)"
  for the x-axis and "Average Score/Hours" for the y-axis)?

  6. Would you like to include markers on the lines to represent the data points?

  7. Do you have preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for different
  mental health metrics?

  8. Should the chart title include more specific details such as the date range of
  the survey or the survey name?

  9. Do you want to display any trendlines or smoothed curves for the average values?'
