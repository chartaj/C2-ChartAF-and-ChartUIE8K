09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Text annotations would be good for displaying the strength values.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. The title could be "Heatmap of Password Categories vs. Offline Crack Time", with
  a subtitle of "Strength values annotated within cells".'
