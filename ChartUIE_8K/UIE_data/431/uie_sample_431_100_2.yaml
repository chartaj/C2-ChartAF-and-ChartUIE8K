initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the rank vs. offline_crack_sec of
  different passwords, highlighting passwords with strength above 7. Use text annotations
  to display the offline_crack_sec for these highlighted points. The chart should
  differentiate between password categories using colors and adjust font_size for
  highlighted ones. This will help understand the vulnerability of passwords in cybersecurity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between password
  categories?

  2. What font size would you prefer for annotations on highlighted points?

  3. Would you like to set specific axis ranges or ticks for the rank and offline_crack_sec
  axes?

  4. Do you prefer a specific marker shape or size for the scatter plot points?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the axes and the chart overall?

  6. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned?

  7. Are there any grid lines or background styles you prefer to include in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include any specific tooltips or hover information for additional
  data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the font size for annotations.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for axis ranges or ticks.

  4. I am not sure about the marker shape or size.

  5. I would like the axes labeled as "Rank" and "Offline Crack Time (sec)" and the
  chart titled "Password Vulnerability Visualization".

  6. I do not know about the legend position.

  7. I do not have a preference for grid lines or background styles.

  8. I do not need tooltips or hover information.'
