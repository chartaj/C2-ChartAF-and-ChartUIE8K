initial_prompt: 'Visualize a line chart showing how long it takes to crack various
  passwords. Highlight the top 3 weakest passwords: "password," "123456," and "12345678."
  Annotate each point on the line with the password and its offline cracking time
  in seconds. Use different colors for categories like "simple-alphanumeric" and "password-related."
  The purpose is to emphasize the ease of cracking these common passwords and raise
  awareness about cybersecurity. Highlight the cracking times in a tooltip when hovering
  over each data point, making the chart interactive and engaging to understand.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different categories like
  "simple-alphanumeric" and "password-related"?

  2. What specific line styles would you like to use for the chart (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used for annotations on
  the chart?

  4. Should the y-axis be in linear or logarithmic scale for better visualization
  of cracking times?

  5. Would you like specific labels or legends to be added to help differentiate between
  categories?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall style of the chart (e.g., minimalistic,
  detailed)?

  7. Are there any specific data points that you would like to emphasize apart from
  the top 3 weakest passwords?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to have grid lines for better readability of data
  points?'
