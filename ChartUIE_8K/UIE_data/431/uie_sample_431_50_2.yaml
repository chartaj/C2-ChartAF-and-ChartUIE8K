initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between 'rank'
  and 'offline_crack_sec' in the context of password security. Highlight data points
  based on 'strength' and use text annotations to display 'password' values, focusing
  on outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for distinguishing data points based
  on ''strength''?

  2. Would you like specific color shades to indicate different ranges of ''strength''
  values?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style or size for text annotations displaying ''password''
  values?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding for ''strength''?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot?

  6. Would you prefer a specific axis scaling (e.g., logarithmic) for ''offline_crack_sec''
  or ''rank''?

  7. Should the outliers be marked with a special symbol or shape?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or labels of the axes?

  9. Would you like tooltips or any hover effects to display additional information
  when hovering over data points?

  10. Do you need additional contextual information, such as average ''strength''
  or a trend line, to be displayed on the chart?'
