  Please create a box chart visualizing the strength of passwords across different
  categories based on the given dataset. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight
  the top three strongest passwords. Also, utilize highlights to emphasize categories
  with extreme values in password strength. The visualization should draw attention
  to how different categories compare in terms of password strength. Additionally,
  include annotations for context about the cybersecurity importance of strong passwords.
  Make sure the chart is visually engaging and informative for those interested in
  cybersecurity.
