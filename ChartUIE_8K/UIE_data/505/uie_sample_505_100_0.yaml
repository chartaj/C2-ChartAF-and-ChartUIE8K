initial_prompt: I need a histogram that shows the distribution of volcano elevations
  from the dataset. Each bar should represent a range of elevations and count how
  many volcanoes fall into each range. Use the 'Elev' column for this. Highlight the
  bar with the most volcanoes to draw attention to the most common elevation range.
  Additionally, annotate the histogram with text labels showing the total count of
  volcanoes in each elevation range. This will help in understanding the elevation
  distribution of volcanoes worldwide and identifying elevation patterns. Please make
  sure the visual is clear and easy to read.
questions: '1. What range of elevation values would you like each bar to represent?

  2. Do you have any specific colors in mind for the bars?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text labels?

  4. Would you like any specific style or design for highlighting the bar with the
  most volcanoes?

  5. Is there a preferred orientation for the histogram (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  7. Would you like to include axis labels, and if so, do you have specific text in
  mind for them?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or markers you''d like to include on the
  chart?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout or background color for the overall chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific colors in mind.

  3. I donâ€™t know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Vertical orientation would be fine.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include axis labels. For the x-axis, "Elevation Range (m)" and for
  the y-axis, "Number of Volcanoes".

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
