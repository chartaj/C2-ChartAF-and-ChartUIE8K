initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot of volcanoes with Latitude on the x-axis and
  Elevation (Elev) on the y-axis. Additionally, differentiate the points by Volcano
  Type using distinct colors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the volcano
  types?

  2. Would you like specific markers or symbols for different volcano types?

  9. Do you have preferences for the range or scale of the axes (e.g., log scale,
  specific range)?

  10. Is there any additional information or context that should be displayed on the
  chart (e.g., average elevation by type)?'
