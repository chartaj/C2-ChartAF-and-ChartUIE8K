initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of volcano types
  across different countries. For the heatmap, use the 'Country' column on the y-axis
  and the 'Type' column on the x-axis. Each cell in the heatmap should represent the
  count of each volcano type per country. This visualization should help identify
  patterns in the geographical distribution of different types of volcanoes around
  the world. Also, ensure that missing values in the 'Type' column are handled appropriately
  by excluding them from the calculation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a color legend to indicate the count ranges?

  3. What font style and size do you prefer for the axis labels?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap?

  5. Should the heatmap cells include the count value as text within each cell?

  6. Are there any specific countries or volcano types you want to highlight?

  7. Would you prefer the heatmap to have a specific size or aspect ratio?

  8. Do you have any preference for the ordering of countries or volcano types (e.g.,
  alphabetical, count-based)?

  9. Should we include any specific labels or annotations on the heatmap to highlight
  key observations?

  10. Do you want any particular title or subtitle for the heatmap?'
