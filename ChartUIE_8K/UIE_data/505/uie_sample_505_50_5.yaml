initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the distribution of volcanos
  globally using Latitude and Longitude from the dataset, color-coded by Elevation.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to represent elevation?

  2. Would you like to include labels or names of volcanoes on the map?

  3. Should the map focus on specific regions or display a global view?

  4. What type of base map would you prefer (e.g., satellite, terrain, simple outline)?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color coding for elevation?

  6. Should we add any additional markers or symbols for significant volcanoes (e.g.,
  active vs. dormant)?

  7. Do you need any specific annotations or additional information displayed on the
  map?'
