initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize volcano types by country using the `Type`
  and `Country` columns from the given data. The size of each rectangle should represent
  the count of volcanoes of that type within each country. Also, ensure that the colors
  distinguish between different volcano types. This visualization will help us understand
  the distribution and prevalence of different volcano types across various countries.
  Make sure to handle missing values appropriately and label the treemap clearly for
  easy interpretation. The key focus here is to analyze the diversity and frequency
  of volcanic activity per country.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  the different volcano types?

  2. Do you prefer any specific labeling style or format for the treemap?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be handled in the visualization? Should
  they be excluded or treated in a specific manner?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels in the treemap?

  5. Do you want the treemap to include legends to make it easier to identify the
  volcano types by color? If so, where should the legend be placed?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about the labeling style or format for the treemap.

  3. I am not sure how missing values should be handled in the visualization.

  4. I have no specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. Yes, I would like the treemap to include legends to identify the volcano types
  by color. I am not sure where the legend should be placed.'
