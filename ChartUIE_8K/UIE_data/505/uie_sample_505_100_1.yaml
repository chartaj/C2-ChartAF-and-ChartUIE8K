initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the elevation changes of various volcanoes
  over different regions. The x-axis should represent the volcano names, and the y-axis
  should represent their elevations. Ensure to distinguish between different volcano
  types using colors. Highlight significant volcanoes exceeding an elevation of 4000
  meters with a different color. Additionally, annotate the volcanoes 'Abu', 'Acamarachi',
  and 'Acatenango' with their respective elevations to draw attention to these data
  points. This chart will help identify elevation trends and significant volcanoes
  across regions in a visually clear manner.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  between different volcano types?

  2. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for annotating the volcanoes
  ''Abu'', ''Acamarachi'', and ''Acatenango''?

  3. What line style would you prefer for the chart (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for labels and annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for different
  volcano types?

  6. How would you prefer the highlighted significant volcanoes (exceeding 4000 meters)
  to be visually distinguished (e.g., different color, marker size)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the background color or grid lines in the chart?

  8. Should the volcano names on the x-axis be displayed at a specific angle for better
  readability?

  9. Would you like to include any additional data labels on the chart for better
  context?

  10. Is there a specific order in which you would like the volcanoes to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by elevation)?'
