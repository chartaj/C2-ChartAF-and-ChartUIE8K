initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the elevation
  (Elev) and latitude (Latitude) of volcanoes across different countries. Utilize
  the "Country" column to differentiate data points by color. The x-axis should represent
  the latitude and the y-axis should represent the elevation. Additionally, incorporate
  tooltips to show the volcano name, type, and status when hovering over each data
  point. The goal is to understand if there's any noticeable pattern or correlation
  between the volcano's location and its elevation. Please ensure the chart has a
  clear legend and axis labels for better readability.

  of information, style)?

  7. Should the axes have specific ranges or should they be auto-scaled to fit the
  data?

  8. Is there a preference for the style of the hover effect on data points?

  9. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?
