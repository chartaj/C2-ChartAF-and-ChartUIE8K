initial_prompt: I have volcano data with columns like Volcano Name, Country, Elevation,
  and Type. Please create a bar chart showing the elevation of different volcano types.
  Highlight top three highest volcanoes for emphasis. Add text annotations to show
  elevation values for these top three. I am particularly interested in Japan, Chile,
  and Guatemala, so please focus on these countries. This visualization will help
  understand the elevation distribution among different types of volcanoes and identify
  significant ones in the specified countries. Use it for educational purposes in
  a geology class.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be grouped or stacked by volcano type?

  3. How would you like the top three highest volcanoes to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, outline)?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text annotations showing
  elevation values?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, any specific
  text for them?

  6. Do you want the legend to show all volcano types or only those present in Japan,
  Chile, and Guatemala?

  7. Are there any grid lines or background styles you prefer?

  8. How do you want to handle volcanoes with missing elevation data?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Different color would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include a title "Volcano Elevations in Japan, Chile, and Guatemala"
  and axis labels "Volcano Type" and "Elevation (meters)".

  6. Only those present in Japan, Chile, and Guatemala.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.'
