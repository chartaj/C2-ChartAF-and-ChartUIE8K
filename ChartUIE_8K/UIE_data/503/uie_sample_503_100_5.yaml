initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the population of different
  cities. Use the 'name' column for the x-axis to represent city names and the 'pop'
  column for the y-axis to represent the population numbers. This will help in comparing
  the population sizes of various cities. Ensure that the chart clearly labels both
  axes and includes a title for better understanding. This is important for urban
  planning and demographic analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  2. What color palette would you prefer for the bars?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be included on the chart?

  4. Should the city names on the x-axis be displayed at a specific angle or orientation?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like the values to be displayed on top of each bar?

  7. Should the chart include any annotations or additional text?

  8. Do you want the bars to be sorted in a specific order, such as ascending or descending
  by population?

  9. Are there any specific margins or padding requirements around the chart?'
