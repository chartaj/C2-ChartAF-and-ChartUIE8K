initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize cities by population size. Plot
  'lat' on the Y-axis and 'lon' on the X-axis. Use the 'pop' column to size the markers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like to include labels for the cities on the scatter plot?

  3. Should the marker size be scaled linearly or logarithmically based on population
  size?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be included in the plot?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  6. Should the axes be labeled with specific names or units?

  7. Do you prefer a specific range for the Y-axis (latitude) or X-axis (longitude)?

  8. Would you like to see any reference lines, such as the equator or prime meridian,
  on the plot?

  9. Is there a preferred background style for the scatter plot (e.g., plain, map-like)?

  10. Do you want a legend to explain the marker sizes corresponding to population
  sizes?'
