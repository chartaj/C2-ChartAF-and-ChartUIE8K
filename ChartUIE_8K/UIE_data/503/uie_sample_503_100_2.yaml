initial_prompt: Visualize the city population data using a choropleth map. Plot cities
  on the map according to their latitude and longitude. Use color gradients to represent
  population density, with darker shades for higher populations and lighter ones for
  lower populations. This visual will help quickly identify areas with high and low
  populations across different cities. Highlight major cities to emphasize prominently
  populated areas. Annotations can include trend lines, shapes outlining high-density
  regions, and highlights for evident trends. This visualization is useful for urban
  development studies and understanding population dispersion. Make sure all city
  markers are well-adjusted for clear visual comprehension.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the population density
  gradient?

  2. Would you like the map to display city names directly on the markers?

  3. Should the size of city markers also represent population in addition to the
  color gradient?

  4. Are there specific major cities you want to ensure are highlighted?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for text annotations?

  6. Are there any particular styles for the trend lines or shapes outlining high-density
  regions that you prefer?

  7. Do you have a preferred map background style (e.g., satellite, terrain, street)?

  8. Would you like a legend to explain the population density color gradient? If
  so, where should it be placed?

  9. Are there any specific geographic regions or cities you want to zoom in on by
  default?'
