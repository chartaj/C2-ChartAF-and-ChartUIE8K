  3. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the annotations showing names and
  population figures?

  4. Should the annotations show exact population figures or a rounded approximation?

  equal intervals, quantiles)?

  6. Are there any specific cities or regions you would like to emphasize more prominently
  on the map?

  7. Is there a preferred size or format for the map labels and legends?

  8. Would you like to include any additional information or context in the map (e.g.,
