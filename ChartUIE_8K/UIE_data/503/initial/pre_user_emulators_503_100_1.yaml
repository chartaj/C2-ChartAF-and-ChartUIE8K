2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart to visualize the population growth of different cities using
  the provided data columns 'name', 'pop', 'lat', and 'lon.' Annotate with trend lines
  to highlight population trends over time. Include highlights to emphasize major
  cities and their population shifts visually. The chart should help in analyzing
  urban population distribution and growth patterns. Utilize shapes to enclose cities
  with significant population changes. This visualization helps in understanding demographic
  changes and urban planning. Ensure the chart clearly represents the data with appropriate
  labels and scales for practical insights.
