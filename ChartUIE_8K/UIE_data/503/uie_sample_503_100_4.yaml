initial_prompt: Create a pie chart comparing the population distribution among major
  cities using the given data. Use the 'pop' and 'name' columns, where 'pop' represents
  the population count and 'name' represents the city names. Each slice of the pie
  chart should correspond to a different city, showing how the population is divided
  among them. Highlight the largest and smallest segments distinctly to emphasize
  the population extremes. The chart should be labeled appropriately, and a legend
  should be included for clarity. Ensure it's visually appealing, suitable for a presentation
  on urban population analytics.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the pie chart slices?

  2. How would you like the largest and smallest segments to be highlighted (e.g.,
  specific colors, patterns, or annotations)?

  3. Do you have a preferred location for the legend (e.g., right, bottom, left, or
  top of the chart)?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart labels and legend?

  5. Would you like the percentage values to be displayed on each slice in addition
  to the population count?

  6. Is there a preferred title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?'

  5. Yes, I would like the percentage values to be displayed on each slice in addition
