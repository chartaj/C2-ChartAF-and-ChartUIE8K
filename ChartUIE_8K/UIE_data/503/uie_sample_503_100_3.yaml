initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the data provided. The x-axis should
  represent the 'lat' (latitude) column, and the y-axis should represent the 'lon'
  (longitude) column. The data points should be colored based on the 'pop' (population)
  column to give a sense of population density. Ensure that the names of the cities
  from the 'name' column are labeled on the scatter plot for better insight. This
  will help visualize the geographical distribution and population density of different
  cities effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing population density
  on the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the city names to be displayed on the scatter plot (e.g.,
  font size, color, placement)?

  3. Would you prefer any specific markers or shapes for the data points on the scatter
  plot?

  4. Should the population density color scale be continuous or categorical? If categorical,
  what ranges would you prefer?

  5. Do you have any particular preferences for the axis labels and titles (e.g.,
  font size, style, color)?

  6. Would you like to add any additional context or annotations to the scatter plot?

  7. Do you have a preference for the size of the data points to reflect population
  density as well, or should this only be indicated by color?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like to have for the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the city names to be displayed in a readable font size and color,
  but I don’t have a specific preference for the placement.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer a continuous color scale for the population density.

  5. I don’t have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I would prefer the size of the data points to also reflect population density
  in addition to color.

  8. I don’t have a specific title in mind.'
