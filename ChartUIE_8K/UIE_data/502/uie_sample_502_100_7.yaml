initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart visualizing the data from the file. The
  X-axis should represent the ''Unnamed: 0'' column, and the Y-axis should show the
  values from columns ''0'' to ''23''. Each column should be a separate line on the
  chart, depicting its trend across the ''Unnamed: 0'' index. This line chart will
  help analyze patterns and variations in the dataset spread over these columns. Highlight
  key trends and differences among the columns to understand the dynamics better.
  This visualization aims to provide insights into the sequential data changes across
  these 24 columns.'
