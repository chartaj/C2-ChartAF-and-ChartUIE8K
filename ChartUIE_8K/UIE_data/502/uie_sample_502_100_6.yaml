initial_prompt: 'Create a stacked column chart using data from 502.csv. The x-axis
  should represent the ''Unnamed: 0'' column, and the y-axis should represent the
  values of columns ''0'' through ''23''. Each stack in the column should correspond
  to each of the columns ''0'' through ''23'', giving a visual aggregation for each
  entry in ''Unnamed: 0''. Use different colors for each category to differentiate
  them clearly. Add appropriate labels for the axes and a legend to identify each
  of the columns ''0'' through ''23''. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to be used for the different
  categories in the stacks?

  2. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the values on the y-axis be displayed in a specific format (e.g., percentage,
  decimal)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order in which the categories (''0'' through
  ''23'') should be stacked within each column?

  6. Would you like the chart to include grid lines or a specific background color?

  7. Do you need any specific annotations or markers on the chart to highlight certain
  data points or ranges?'
