initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the spread and distribution
  of the values in columns 0 through 23 from this dataset. I'm interested in understanding
  the variability and outliers within these columns. The x-axis should represent the
  columns (0 through 23) and the y-axis should represent the data values. This will
  help analyze the central tendency and spread of each column effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to display the outliers explicitly with specific markers?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the labels or titles on the axes?

  5. Is there a particular style or theme you want to follow for the chart''s appearance?

  6. Do you want to include a legend, even though it''s a box chart?

  7. Should the chart include annotations or comments on certain data points?'
