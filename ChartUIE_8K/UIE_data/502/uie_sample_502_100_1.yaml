initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using columns 0 to 23 from the provided dataset.
  Each point in the plot should represent one of the rows. Add text annotations to
  highlight key values in the first three columns. By doing this, the audience's attention
  will be drawn to the initial trends before examining the entire dataset. Use highlights
  to distinguish these initial points by changing their color or size, emphasizing
  their importance. The visualization should effectively convey trends and variations
  across different columns, aiding in data analysis and decision-making. Keep the
  chart practical for data science and analytics purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., font size, color, position)?

  3. Do you prefer certain shapes for the points in the scatter plot?

  4. Should the highlighted points be emphasized using a specific color or size, and
  do you have any preferences for these highlights?

  5. Would you like any gridlines or axis labels to be customized in a specific way?

  6. Is there a particular title or subtitle you would like for the scatter plot?

  7. Do you want a legend included, and if so, do you have any specific preferences
  for its placement or format?

  8. Are there any specific axis scales (linear or logarithmic) or ranges you would
  prefer for the chart?

  9. Do you need specific markers for the rows represented by the points, and if so,
  what kind?'
