initial_prompt: Please create a histogram for each of the columns labeled '0' to '23'
  to display the frequency distribution of the values in each of those columns. We
  need to understand the spread and common value ranges in these datasets. Utilize
  the data provided in each column to plot individual histograms, which will help
  identify patterns or anomalies in the datasets. Make sure each histogram is clearly
  labeled with the respective column number for easy identification and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histograms?

  2. What title would you like for each histogram?

  3. Would you prefer a specific range of bins for the histograms, or should they
  be automatically determined?

  4. Do you need a legend for each histogram, or are the axis labels sufficient?

  5. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and titles?

  6. Should the y-axis be consistent across all histograms for easy comparison?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background for better readability?

  8. Do you have any specific size dimensions in mind for each histogram?

  9. Should each histogram include annotations for specific values or ranges?

  10. Do you want to include summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) on the histograms?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Label each histogram with the respective column number.

  3. Automatically determined bins are fine.

  4. Axis labels are sufficient.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Yes, the y-axis should be consistent across all histograms for easy comparison.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific size dimensions in mind.

  9. No, annotations for specific values or ranges are not needed.

  10. I do not know.'
