initial_prompt: Please create a parallel coordinates chart using the data columns
  from '../Extra_datas/data/502.csv'. Ensure each column from '0' to '23' is represented
  as a separate axis in the chart. The data should be visualized to compare patterns
  and correlations among these numerical values. Highlight the sample data points
  with different colors to distinguish between them. This will help us better understand
  the relationships and variations across these dimensions. Make sure the chart is
  interactive for a deeper analysis of individual data points across the multiple
  axes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for specific color schemes to highlight
  different sample data points?

  2. Would you like the axes to be normalized or standardized for better comparison?

  3. Do you prefer specific line styles or thicknesses for the sample data points?

  4. Should there be any specific labels or titles for each axis?

  5. Is there a particular background style or color you favor for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or orientation of the axes (horizontal
  vs. vertical)?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines or other visual aids to improve readability?

  8. Are there any specific legends or annotations you want to include for better
  interpretation?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for axis labels and titles?'
