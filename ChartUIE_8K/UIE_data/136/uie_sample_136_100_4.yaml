initial_prompt: I want to see histograms for the age distribution from the stroke
  prediction dataset. Include gender-based segmentation to compare distributions between
  males, females, and others. Also, create additional histograms for avg_glucose_level
  and bmi, highlighting the differences between stroke and non-stroke patients. Make
  sure to handle missing bmi values appropriately in the visualizations. The charts
  should help understand if there are any apparent trends or patterns in the data
  regarding stroke occurrences related to age, glucose levels, and bmi. Show clear
  legends and labels for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing different
  genders and stroke statuses in the histograms?

  2. What bin widths or intervals would you prefer for the histograms of age, avg_glucose_level,
  and bmi?

  3. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted?

  4. Should the charts include a title? If yes, do you have any specific titles in
  mind for each histogram?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for displaying the histograms? For example, should
  age, avg_glucose_level, and bmi histograms be displayed in a single row or column?

  6. Would you like the missing bmi values to be represented in a specific way in
  the histograms? For example, using imputation or annotations?

  7. How detailed should the legends be? For example, would you prefer simple labels
  like ''Male'', ''Female'', ''Others'' and ''Stroke'', ''Non-Stroke'', or more descriptive
  ones?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart annotations
  and labels?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or markers to highlight significant
  patterns or differences in the data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, include titles. For age: "Age Distribution by Gender", for avg_glucose_level:
  "Avg Glucose Level and Stroke Status", for bmi: "BMI and Stroke Status".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, use imputation to handle missing bmi values in the histograms.

  7. I prefer simple labels like ''Male'', ''Female'', ''Others'' and ''Stroke'',
  ''Non-Stroke''.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, add annotations to highlight significant patterns or differences in the
  data.'
