initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the average glucose level (avg_glucose_level)
  and BMI (bmi) trends across different ages within the Stroke Prediction Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like separate lines for ''avg_glucose_level'' and ''bmi'' or a combined
  line to show the trend together?

  3. Are there any specific age ranges or intervals that you want to highlight in
  the chart?

  4. Should the chart include data points, lines, or both to represent the trends?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  6. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability of data
  trends?

  7. Should we include labels for the axes and/or legends for the lines? If yes, do
  you have any preferences for these labels?

  8. Do you want to display any statistical measures such as trend lines, confidence
  intervals, or moving averages on the chart?

  9. Are there any specific chart titles or subtitles you would like to include for
  better context?

  10. Do you prefer to show missing BMI values as gaps in the line chart or connect
  them using some form of interpolation?'
