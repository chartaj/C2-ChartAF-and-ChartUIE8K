initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for analyzing stroke patterns in the Stroke
  Prediction Dataset. Please plot 'avg_glucose_level' on the x-axis and 'bmi' on the
  y-axis. Use different colors to indicate 'gender' (e.g., blue for Male, red for
  Female). Additionally, differentiate by 'smoking_status' using different shapes
  or markers (e.g., circles for 'formerly smoked', squares for 'never smoked'). Ensure
  the chart highlights any visible trends between glucose levels, BMI, and the likelihood
  of experiencing a stroke. Include a legend and axis labels.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the scatter plot?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color shades for ''gender'' other than blue for Male
  and red for Female?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines in the background of the chart?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Should the chart include data point labels for each marker?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific ranges or thresholds on the axes?

  7. How would you like to handle missing BMI values (e.g., omit points, use a placeholder
  value)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers used for different ''smoking_status''
  categories?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  5. No, the chart does not need data point labels for each marker.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I am not sure, please handle missing BMI values as you see fit.

  8. I have no specific preference for the size of the markers.'
