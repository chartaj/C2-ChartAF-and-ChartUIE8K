initial_prompt: 'Create a stacked column chart to visualize the stroke prediction
  dataset. Use gender, smoking_status, and stroke as categories. Each bar should represent
  a gender and be divided into sections for different smoking statuses: ''formerly
  smoked'', ''never smoked'', ''smokes'', and ''Unknown''. Highlight the sections
  where strokes occurred to draw attention to these critical factors. Add text annotations
  for avg_glucose_level and bmi data points to provide context regarding health metrics
  for each gender. This visualization will help in understanding the relationship
  between smoking, gender, and the likelihood of strokes.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the chart, especially
  for highlighting the sections where strokes occurred?

  2. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  3. Do you have any specific font styles or sizes that you would like to use for
  the text annotations and labels?

  4. How would you like to handle missing ''bmi'' data in the annotations?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the order of the smoking_status categories within
  each gender bar?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines, and if so, what format should they take
  (e.g., light, heavy, dashed)?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want to appear on the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the text annotations (e.g., horizontal,
  angled)?

  9. Should the sections of the bars be labeled with percentages or raw counts?

  10. Would you like to include error bars or confidence intervals for avg_glucose_level
  and bmi annotations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme. Please choose a scheme that clearly
  differentiates the sections and highlights the stroke occurrences.

  2. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure where it should be located.

  3. I do not have any specific preferences for font styles or sizes.

  4. I am not sure how to handle missing ''bmi'' data.

  5. I have no specific preference for the order of the smoking_status categories
  within each gender bar.

  6. Yes, include gridlines. I am not sure about the format.

  7. Title: "Relationship Between Smoking, Gender, and Stroke Likelihood". Subtitle:
  "Including avg_glucose_level and bmi Metrics".

  8. I have no specific preference for the orientation of the text annotations.

  9. Label the sections with percentages.

  10. I do not know if error bars or confidence intervals are necessary.'
