initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the Stroke Prediction Dataset showing age
  on the x-axis and avg_glucose_level on the y-axis. Color the points based on stroke
  outcome (stroke vs. no stroke) to visualize the relationship between age, glucose
  level, and stroke incidents.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the stroke vs. no stroke
  categories?

  2. Would you like to add a title to the scatter plot? If yes, please provide the
  preferred title text.

  3. Would you like to label the x-axis and y-axis explicitly?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color coding for stroke outcomes?

  6. Would you like to display any grid lines or background shading for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific data points you want to highlight or annotate on the plot?

  8. What font style and size do you prefer for chart labels and titles?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Age" and the y-axis as "Average Glucose Level".

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color coding for stroke outcomes.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not know.'
