initial_prompt: I want an OHLC chart using the Ethereum data to visualize the Open,
  High, Low, and Close prices over time. Please highlight specific data points that
  stand out and add annotations displaying these values for better clarity. The purpose
  is to easily identify trends and significant dates for Ethereumâ€™s performance and
  to focus attention on key price movements. Make sure the chart is visually appealing
  and emphasizes the most important aspects of the data for a clear, insightful presentation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the chart elements?

  2. Would you like any particular date ranges to be emphasized or highlighted?

  3. Are there any specific data points or price movements you''d like to be particularly
  annotated?

  4. Do you have a preference for the overall theme of the chart (e.g., dark or light
  theme)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability, and if so, should
  they be light or prominent?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to be static or should it have zooming capabilities for
  detailed views?

  8. Are there any specific time intervals (daily, weekly, monthly) you would like
  the data to be aggregated or displayed in?

  9. Is there a preferred method for highlighting significant dates (e.g., color markers,
  shapes, etc.)?

  10. Would you like to see any additional indicators or overlays (e.g., moving averages,
  volume) on the chart?'
