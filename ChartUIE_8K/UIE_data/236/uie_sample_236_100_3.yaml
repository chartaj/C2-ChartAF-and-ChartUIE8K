initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap that shows the correlation between the various
  audio features (like danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness,
  etc.) and the popularity of the songs from the dataset. The heatmap should make
  it easy to identify which features are most strongly associated with higher popularity.
  Use the columns for the audio features and popularity, and ensure each feature is
  clearly labeled on the axes. This visualization will help in understanding the impact
  of different musical characteristics on a song's popularity within the specified
  years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a color gradient or distinct color bands to represent different
  correlation values?

  3. Should we use a specific color palette (e.g., warm, cool, or diverging)?

  4. Do you prefer the axis labels to be rotated for better readability?

  5. Would you like values to be displayed within the heatmap cells for precise correlation
  figures?

  6. Should we include a legend to explain the color gradients of the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preferred range for the correlation coefficients (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  8. Should we apply any clustering or sorting to the features for better pattern
  identification?

  9. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and titles?

  10. Would you like any additional annotations or notes to be included in the heatmap?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, rotating the axis labels would be helpful for readability.

  5. Yes, displaying the values within the heatmap cells would be useful.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. I do not have a preferred range, the standard -1 to 1 is fine.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. No, additional annotations or notes are not necessary.
