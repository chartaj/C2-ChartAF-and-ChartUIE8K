initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map displaying global access to electricity (%
  of population) by country. Highlight specific countries with notable trends and
  provide text annotations for countries with significant improvements or declines
  from 2000 to 2002. Ensure the map utilizes the unique values and highlights the
  disparities in electricity access. Include visual distinctions for regions with
  varied access levels and provide contextual text annotations to draw attention to
  key insights. This visual will help understand global progress and regional disparities
  in electricity access, essential for energy policy and developmental goals.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Which specific countries or regions would you like to focus on?

  3. Do you want any specific color gradients to represent different levels of electricity
  access?

  4. How would you like significant improvements or declines to be visually indicated
  (e.g., color, symbols, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the text annotations (e.g., font size,
  style, placement)?

  6. How granular should the regional distinctions be (e.g., continents, subregions)?

  7. Are there any particular map projections you prefer to use for the choropleth
  map?

  8. Do you have any specific insights or key points you would like to highlight in
  the contextual text annotations?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but focusing on both developed and developing countries would
  be useful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Using symbols like arrows or specific colors to indicate improvements or declines
  could be helpful.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Highlight the progress in countries that have made significant strides in improving
  access and also point out regions where access has declined or stagnated.'
