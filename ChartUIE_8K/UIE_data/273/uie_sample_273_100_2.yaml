initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the access to electricity (%
  of population) across different countries from 2000 to 2002. Highlight specific
  data points where significant increases occur. Text annotations should display percentages
  of these highlighted data points to emphasize improvements. The purpose is to show
  the progress made in global electricity access over the years, focusing on countries
  with notable changes. Additionally, provide a summary of how many countries saw
  improvements versus those that remained stagnant, to provide context on global energy
  accessibility trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant increases
  in the data?

  2. Would you like to display grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations displaying
  percentages?

  4. Do you have any preference for the position of the legend on the chart?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels be displayed in a specific format or style?

  6. Do you need any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Would you like the countries to be sorted in any particular order on the chart?

  8. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for annotating the summary of
  countries with improvements versus those that remained stagnant?

  9. Do you have a preferred layout or appearance for the box chart, such as a vertically
  or horizontally oriented chart?

  10. Are there any additional notes or labels you want to include on the chart to
  provide extra context to the audience?'
