initial_prompt: Please create an area chart using the provided data format about global
  access to electricity. The x-axis should represent the Year, and the y-axis should
  show the percentage of the population with access to electricity. Different countries
  should be represented by different colored areas. This will help visualize trends
  over time and compare the progress of electricity access across various countries.
  Utilize any missing values adequately and ensure the chart is easy to interpret,
  with suitable legends and labels to clearly distinguish among the countries. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  countries?

  2. Would you like to specify the range for the y-axis, or should it be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  3. Are there particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels, legend,
  and title?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  5. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, or right)?

  6. How would you like to handle the missing values in the dataset (e.g., interpolate,
  omit, or specific method)?

  7. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier interpretation of the data points?

  8. Would you prefer any additional annotations or markers to highlight significant
  milestones or trends?'
