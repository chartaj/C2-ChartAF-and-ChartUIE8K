initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the "Students Adaptability Level
  in Online Education" dataset. Split the donut segments to show the distribution
  of different "Adaptivity Level" values like 'Moderate,' 'Low,' and 'High.' Highlight
  the segments with annotations that display the percentage of students in each category
  to emphasize their values. Use a legend or color coding to differentiate between
  'Moderate,' 'Low,' and 'High.' The goal is to quickly convey the adaptability levels
  of students in an engaging visual format, aiding in the identification of which
  adaptability level prevails among the students. Focus on visual clarity and informativeness.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the ''Moderate,'' ''Low,''
  and ''High'' adaptivity levels?

  2. Would you like the chart to include any specific title or subtitle?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the annotations?

  4. Should the legend be placed at any specific position (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right) on the chart?

  5. How detailed do you want the percentage annotations to be (e.g., whole numbers,
  one decimal place)?

  6. Do you want any additional information or context indicated on the chart (e.g.,
  sample size, data source)?

  7. Would you prefer the segments to have border lines, or should they be seamless?

  8. Are there any specific themes or styles (e.g., modern, minimalist) you would
  prefer for the chart design?

  9. Should the annotations be placed inside the donut segments, outside, or following
  another placement rule?

  10. Do you have any accessibility considerations (e.g., colorblind-friendly palette)
  for the chart design?'
