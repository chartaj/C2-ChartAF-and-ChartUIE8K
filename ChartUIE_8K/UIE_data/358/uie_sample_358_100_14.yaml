initial_prompt: I need a spline chart that shows students' adaptability levels in
  online education. Use data columns like Gender, Age, Education Level, Institution
  Type, IT Student Status, Location, Load-shedding, Financial Condition, Internet
  Type, Network Type, Class Duration, Self Lms usage, Device, and Adaptivity Level.
  The chart should plot the Adaptivity Level on the Y-axis and the Class Duration
  on the X-axis, with different lines representing different Age groups. Highlight
  any patterns based on Institution Type and Internet Type. Please make the chart
  clear and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different Age groups
  represented in the chart?

  2. Should the lines for different Age groups have specific styles such as dashed
  or dotted, or should they all be solid?

  3. Do you prefer specific markers for data points along the spline chart, such as
  circles, squares, or none?

  4. How would you like to display Institution Type and Internet Type patterns? For
  example, through distinct color codes, annotations, or different line styling?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and legends?

  7. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for both X-axis (Class Duration) and
  Y-axis (Adaptivity Level)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the limits or range of values displayed on the
  Y-axis (Adaptivity Level) and X-axis (Class Duration)?

  9. Should the chart include titles and labels for the X-axis and Y-axis? If so,
  do you have any specific wording in mind?

  10. Do you want the chart to include data point tooltips that display additional
  information when hovered over?

  11. Are there any particular themes or styles you would like to use for the overall
  look of the chart (e.g., minimalist, colorful, professional)?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the different Age groups.

  2. I am not sure about the line styles; it can be solid if that''s the default.

  3. No specific preference for markers on the data points.

  4. I am not sure; possibly distinct color codes for Institution Type and Internet
  Type would be fine.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend. The position can be at the bottom.

  6. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for both X-axis and Y-axis.

  8. I have no specific preferences for the limits or range of values displayed on
  the axes.

  9. Yes, the chart should include titles and labels. You can use "Class Duration"
  for the X-axis and "Adaptivity Level" for the Y-axis.

  10. I do not need tooltips since this will be an image.

  11. No specific theme or style, any professional-looking style would be great.'
