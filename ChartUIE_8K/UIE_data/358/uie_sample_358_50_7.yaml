initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of students'
  age groups and their respective adaptivity levels in online education. The x-axis
  should show age groups ('16-20', '21-25', etc.), and the y-axis should show the
  count of students. Use different colors for each adaptivity level ('Low', 'Moderate',
  'High').
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or themes for distinguishing
  adaptivity levels?

  2. Would you like to include labels or legends on the chart? If so, do you have
  any specific preferences for their placement?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines? If yes, do you have a preference for their
  style (e.g., dashed, solid) or color?

  5. Do you want the chart to display exact counts on the bars, or should it just
  show the bar heights?

  6. Is there any specific order you would like the age groups to be displayed on
  the x-axis?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or markers to highlight specific data
  points or ranges?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the histogram?'
