initial_prompt: I want a grouped column chart that shows the number of boys and girls
  across different age groups (16-20, 21-25, etc.). The columns should be divided
  by gender, and there should be different colors for boys and girls to compare them
  visually. This will help us understand the distribution of students' age groups
  by gender in the context of their adaptability to online education. Make sure the
  chart is clear and the different age groups are well-labeled for quick and easy
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the colors representing boys and
  girls?

  2. What should be the title of the chart?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used for boys and girls?

  4. Should the y-axis be labeled as ''Number of Students'' or do you have a different
  preference?

  5. Do you want the age groups on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific order?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  titles?

  7. Do you need grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  8. Is there a specific width and height you prefer for the columns?

  9. Would you like to include data labels on top of the columns to show exact values?

  10. Should the chart include a source note at the bottom? If yes, what should it
  say?'
