initial_prompt: I want a line chart that shows the adaptability level of students
  in online education. The x-axis should represent the different age groups, and the
  y-axis should represent the percentage of students at each adaptivity level (Low,
  Moderate, High). Each line on the chart should represent different financial conditions
  (Poor, Mid, Rich). The chart should help visualize how adaptability levels change
  with age and financial conditions. This will help in understanding the patterns
  and relationships in students' adaptability to online learning based on age and
  financial status.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme for each financial
  condition line (e.g., Poor, Mid, Rich)?

  3. Would you like data markers (e.g., circles or squares) on each data point on
  the lines?

  4. Do you prefer grid lines in the background for easier readability?

  5. What font style and size would you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you want a legend to specify which color represents which financial condition?
  If yes, where would you like it positioned?

  7. Should the y-axis be scaled in a specific way (e.g., increments of 10%, logarithmic
  scale)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  9. Would you like labels directly on the lines to represent the percentage values
  at key points?

  10. Do you want the adaptability levels (Low, Moderate, High) to be differentiated
  by line style or color?'
