initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the "Students Adaptability
  Level in Online Education". Use "Gender", "Education Level", and "IT Student" as
  the categories for the bars. Stack the bars using different segments for "Adaptivity
  Level". Label the x-axis with the specified categories, and the y-axis with the
  count of students. Color-code each segment in the stack based on "Adaptivity Level"
  such as low, moderate, and high. This will help compare and analyze the adaptability
  levels for various demographics and student types in a clear and concise manner.

  title?
