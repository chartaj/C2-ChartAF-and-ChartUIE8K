initial_prompt: I have data on students' adaptability levels in online education,
  such as Gender, Age, Education Level, etc. Can you create a scatter plot for me?
  I want the scatter plot to show the relationship between Age and Class Duration,
  with the Adaptivity Level as the color code. Points should be differentiated by
  their Gender using different shapes. It would be great if you could include a legend
  for understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Adaptivity Level?

  2. How would you like the Age categories to be displayed on the axis (e.g., as continuous
  values or bins)?

  3. Are there specific shapes you prefer for differentiating Gender?

  4. Do you have a preference for the size of the scatter plot points?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be included in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Should outliers be highlighted or treated in any specific way?'

  2. I have no specific preference.
