initial_prompt: I want to visualize the students' adaptability levels in online education
  using a box plot. The dataset includes various factors like Gender, Age, Education
  Level, Institution Type, IT Student, Location, Load-shedding, Financial Condition,
  Internet Type, Network Type, Class Duration, Self Lms, Device, and Adaptivity Level.
  Specifically, create a box plot for the Adaptivity Level, segmented by Age groups.
  This box chart should help to understand the distribution of adaptability across
  different ages. Ensure the box plot highlights median, quartiles, and potential
  outliers clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box plot?

  2. Should we label each Age group directly on the plot for clarity?

  3. Do you want to add any annotations or explanatory text on the box plot?

  4. Would you like to highlight any specific Age group or Adaptivity Level in a distinct
  color?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the Age groups to be displayed?

  6. Should the plot include grid lines for easier reading of quartiles and medians?

  7. Do you want to adjust the axis scales or keep them automatic based on the data
  distribution?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. Yes, it would be helpful to label each Age group directly on the plot for clarity.
