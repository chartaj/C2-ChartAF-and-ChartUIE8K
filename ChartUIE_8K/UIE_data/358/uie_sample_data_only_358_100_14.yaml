09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for the different Age
  groups.

  2. I am not sure about the line styles; it can be solid if that''s the default.

  3. No specific preference for markers on the data points.

  4. I am not sure; possibly distinct color codes for Institution Type and Internet
  Type would be fine.

  5. Yes, the chart should include a legend. The position can be at the bottom.

  6. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  7. Yes, please include gridlines for both X-axis and Y-axis.

  8. I have no specific preferences for the limits or range of values displayed on
  the axes.

  9. Yes, the chart should include titles and labels. You can use "Class Duration"
  for the X-axis and "Adaptivity Level" for the Y-axis.

  10. I do not need tooltips since this will be an image.

  11. No specific theme or style, any professional-looking style would be great.'
