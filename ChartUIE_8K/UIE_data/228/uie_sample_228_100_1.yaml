initial_prompt: Create a bar chart for the 'DEPARTMENT' column, counting the unique
  'NAME' entries per department. Highlight the departments with the highest and lowest
  counts to emphasize the distribution. Annotate the department names with the highest
  counts to focus viewer attention. This visualization aims to provide a quick overview
  of the employee distribution across departments, highlighting areas with more or
  fewer board/commission members, which is valuable for organizational analysis within
  the context of the Chicago Ethics Pledge data. This helps identify any departments
  that might require attention or additional resources.

  with the highest and lowest counts?

  6. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like on the chart?
