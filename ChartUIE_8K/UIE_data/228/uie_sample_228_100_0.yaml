initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of unique departments
  from the Chicago Ethics Pledge data. The chart should highlight the department with
  the maximum entries to emphasize its significance. Ensure that there are data-driven
  annotations displaying the names of the top three departments along with their respective
  percentages. This visualization will help in understanding how the pledges are distributed
  across different departments and can serve as an important insight for departmental
  analysis and resource allocation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to have a title or any specific headings?

  3. Should the annotations for the top three departments be in a specific font size
  or style?

  4. Do you have any preference for the legend placement in the pie chart (e.g., right,
  bottom)?

  5. Would you like the chart to be displayed with or without 3D effects?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the slices to be displayed in (e.g.,
  descending by number of entries)?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to include percentage labels on each slice in addition
  to the top three annotations?

  8. Would you like gridlines or any additional borders around the slices for better
  visual separation?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
