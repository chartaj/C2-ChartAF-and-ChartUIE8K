initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the number of animal rescue incidents per
  year. Use the 'cal_year' column for years and the 'animal_group_parent' column to
  differentiate between categories like 'Dog', 'Fox', etc.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different animal categories?

  2. Should the histogram bins represent each year individually, or would you like
  to group years into ranges (e.g., every 5 years)?

  incidents? Would you prefer to group such categories together under ''Other''?

  4. Do you have a specific order preference for the animal categories in the legend?

  5. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  6. Should the histogram display the count or percentage of incidents per animal
  category?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the histogram (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Would you like to display grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the appearance of the axes (e.g., labeled
  years, tick marks, etc.)?

  to be?'
