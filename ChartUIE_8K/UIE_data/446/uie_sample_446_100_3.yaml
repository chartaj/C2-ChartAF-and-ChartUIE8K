initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize the number of animal rescue incidents
  per borough. Use the 'borough' and 'incident_number' columns to aggregate the data.
  Highlight each borough in varying colors based on the count of incidents. Include
  data points like 'latitude' and 'longitude' to ensure accurate mapping locations.
  Consider adding a tooltip feature to display specific details when hovering over
  each borough, such as 'incident_notional_cost', 'property_type', and 'animal_group_parent'.
  This will help in understanding the distribution and types of animal rescues across
  different areas. Use the property categories for coloring criteria.

  based on the count of incidents?
