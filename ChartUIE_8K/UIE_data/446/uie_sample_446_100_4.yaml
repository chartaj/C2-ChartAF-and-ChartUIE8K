initial_prompt: I'd like a donut chart that visualizes the distribution of animal
  group parents involved in special service incidents. The chart should show the proportion
  of each animal group (like Dog, Fox, etc.) from the raw data. Please ensure that
  the legend clearly marks each animal group with distinct colors and include percentages
  for clarity. The goal is to easily understand which types of animals are most frequently
  involved in these incidents. The analysis should be reflective of the data provided,
  highlighting variations in animal rescues across different properties and wards.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinct animal groups
  in the legend?

  2. Would you like the chart to include additional labels or annotations besides
  percentages for clarity?

  3. Is there a preferred order in which the animal groups should be displayed (e.g.,
  ascending/descending by percentage)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the legend and labels?

  5. Should the donut chart include a title and if so, what should it be?

  6. Do you want a particular background color or theme for the donut chart?

  7. How would you like variations across different properties and wards to be highlighted
  in the visualization?'
