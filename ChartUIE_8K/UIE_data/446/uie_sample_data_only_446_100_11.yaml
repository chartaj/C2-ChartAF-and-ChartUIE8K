02_initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the total incident notional cost
  for different types of animal rescues in 2009. Use data from the file `446.csv`.
  The x-axis should represent the types of animal rescues, and the y-axis should show
  the total incident notional cost. Include distinct colors for the bars to differentiate
  between various types of animal rescues. This will help analyze which kind of animal
  rescue incurs the highest notional cost. Please ensure the chart is clear and easy
  to understand, with appropriate labels and title.
