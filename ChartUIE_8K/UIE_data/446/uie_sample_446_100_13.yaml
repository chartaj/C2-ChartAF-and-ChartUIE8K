initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart visualizing the number of animal rescues
  over time. Use the 'date_time_of_call' for the x-axis to represent the timeline
  and 'type_of_incident' and 'animal_group_parent' for categories, to show each type's
  trend and different animals rescued. Additionally, highlight the total 'incident_notional_cost'
  as a line over the months to display financial implications, ensuring clarity on
  the peak periods for animal rescues and associated costs. This will help analyze
  rescue trends and resource allocation needs through the year. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between ''type_of_incident''
  and ''animal_group_parent'' categories?

  2. Would you like specific labels for peak periods on the ''incident_notional_cost''
  line?

  3. How would you prefer us to display the financial implications: using lines, shaded
  areas, or another method?

  4. Do you have a preference for the format of the x-axis (e.g., monthly, quarterly,
  annually)?

  5. Should we use markers on data points for additional clarity, or would you prefer
  a smoother spline without markers?

  6. Would you like a legend displayed on the chart, and if so, where would you prefer
  it to be placed (e.g., bottom, right side)?

  7. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the chart titles and labels?

  8. Do you have a preference for displaying grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the chart?

  10. Should we incorporate a secondary y-axis for ''incident_notional_cost'', or
  would you prefer it plotted on the same y-axis as the number of rescues?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yes, specific labels for peak periods on the ''incident_notional_cost'' line
  would be helpful.

  3. I am not sure, perhaps lines might work best.

  4. Monthly format for the x-axis would be great.

  5. I do not know, either option is fine by me.

  6. Yes, a legend would be helpful. Maybe place it on the right side.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for the font style and size.

  8. Yes, displaying grid lines would improve readability.

  9. I am not sure, so no specific annotations or notes are needed.

  10. I am not sure, you can decide what works best for clarity.'
