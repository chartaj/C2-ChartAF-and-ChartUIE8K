initial_prompt: 'Create a line chart visualizing annual animal rescues. Highlight
  trends in rescue count, focusing on notable spikes or declines. Annotate key points
  related to types of incidents and high-cost rescues. Context: zoology and animal
  rescue operations.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to see specific types of incidents color-coded or represented
  differently in the chart?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style of annotations (e.g., text boxes, symbols,
  arrows) for key points related to types of incidents and high-cost rescues?

  4. How would you like the y-axis to be scaled â€” starting from zero or from the minimum
  value of rescue counts?

  5. Should the line chart include markers for each data point, or would you prefer
  a smooth line?

  6. Do you need a legend explaining the different types of incidents and cost ranges?

  7. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the x-axis labels (e.g., YYYY,
  ''Year YYYY'')?

  8. Are there any specific symbols or notation you prefer for identifying high-cost
  rescues on the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a grid background to help identify the trends and points more easily?

  10. Should the chart include a title and subtitle, and if so, do you have specific
  wording in mind?

  11. Would you like to see any additional statistical information (e.g., average,
  median) overlaid on the chart?'
