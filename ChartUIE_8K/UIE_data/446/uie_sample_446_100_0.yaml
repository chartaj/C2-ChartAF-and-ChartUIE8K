initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of incident
  notional costs for animal rescues over different years. Highlight any outliers and
  annotate significant points to focus on notable incidents. Emphasize variations
  across different boroughs and property types to understand their impact on costs.
  The chart should help identify trends and anomalies in the expenses associated with
  animal rescue operations. This visualization will be crucial for understanding cost
  patterns and planning resource allocation for future rescues within various boroughs.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different boroughs
  and property types?

  2. How would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different color, shape,
  or size)?

  3. Are there any specific significant incidents we should annotate on the chart?

  4. What level of detail would you like for the annotations of significant points
  (e.g., just the cost, description of the incident)?

  5. How would you prefer the years to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., every year,
  every five years)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the style and format of the box plots (e.g., whisker
  length, box width)?

  7. Should the overall trend line for the data also be included in the visualization?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend that differentiates between property
  types and boroughs?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the title and labels of the chart?

  10. Is there any particular font style or size that you prefer for the text on the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Different color for the outliers would be good.

  3. I am not sure about specific incidents to annotate.

  4. Just the cost for the annotations of significant points is fine.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the style and format of the box plots.

  7. Yes, including the overall trend line would be helpful.

  8. Yes, please include a legend that differentiates between property types and boroughs.
