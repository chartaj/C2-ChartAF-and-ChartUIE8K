initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating the number of animal rescues over
  the years. Highlight key incidents and annotate summary statistics like average
  incident costs, frequency by boroughs, and rescue types. This will help visualize
  trends and patterns in animal rescue operations. Include annotations for significant
  peaks or drops in the data to draw attention. Use different colors for various types
  of incidents to distinguish them. The practical purpose is to provide insights into
  the yearly variation and distribution of animal rescue activities, aiding in resource
  allocation and policy planning in zoology contexts.
questions: '1. What specific color scheme or palette do you prefer for differentiating
  various types of incidents?

  2. Would you like to use any particular style or format for the annotations (e.g.,
  text size, font, colors, etc.)?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the chart''s title, axis labels, and legend?

  4. Should the line chart have grid lines? If so, do you prefer horizontal, vertical,
  or both?

  5. Is there a specific format or template for the summary statistics you would like
  included?

  6. How would you like key incidents to be highlighted (e.g., using markers, arrows,
  different line styles)?

  7. Do you want to include any additional data labels on the chart (e.g., data values,
  percentages)?

  8. Is there a particular range or scale you prefer for the y-axis (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  9. Would you like the frequency by boroughs and rescue types to be included in a
  legend or as part of the annotations on the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the chart background color or texture?'
