initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing the number of incidents by borough
  and type of incident. Highlight boroughs with the highest and lowest incidents to
  draw attention. Annotate specific high-impact incidents, especially those involving
  domestic pets or unique animal rescues. Ensure annotations provide context.

  chart or as a legend/key?

  6. Would you like tooltips to provide additional context when hovering over specific
  bars or annotations?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  annotations?

  8. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?

  9. Do you want gridlines in the chart? If yes, should they be major and/or minor
  gridlines?

  10. Is there a specific order you want the boroughs displayed in the chart (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by number of incidents)?
