initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the number of animal rescues
  based on different animal groups (e.g., Dog, Fox) and types of incidents. Use the
  'borough' as the category axis and show separate stacks for each 'special_service_type'.
  Count incidents for each borough and show relative frequencies within each borough.
  This will allow us to compare the types of animal rescues across different boroughs.
  The chart should help in identifying hotspots for specific animal rescue types and
  will be useful for resource allocation. Add legends and axis labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. How would you like the legend to be positioned (e.g., right, top, bottom, left)?

  3. Do you want specific colors assigned to certain animal groups or incident types?

  4. Would you prefer a specific style for the axis labels (e.g., font size, font
  type)?

  5. Should data labels be included on the bars for more precise numbers?

  6. Do you have a recommended title for the chart?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like on the chart?

  8. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a particular format for the relative frequencies (e.g., percentage,
  decimal)?

  10. Is there any additional contextual information you would like included in the
  chart?'

  7. No specific annotations or markers.

  8. Yes, please show grid lines.

  9. Use percentages for the relative frequencies.

  10. No additional contextual information is needed.'
