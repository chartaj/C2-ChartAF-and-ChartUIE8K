initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the number of animal rescues by boroughs
  and wards, with intensity showing the frequency. Use columns 'borough', 'ward',
  'animal_group_parent', and 'incident_number'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  3. Should the heatmap include labels for frequency intensity or just varying shades
  of color?

  4. Do you want to display the exact numbers on each cell of the heatmap?

  5. Should the heatmap show a gradient legend to indicate the intensity of rescues?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout for the boroughs and wards on the heatmap (e.g.,
  alphabetical order, based on rescue frequency)?

  7. Would you like to categorize or filter the data further by different animal groups?

  8. Do you want to include geographic boundaries or other contextual information
  in the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap include annotations or tooltips for additional insights?
