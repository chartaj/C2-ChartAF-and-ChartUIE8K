initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of property
  categories involved in animal rescues. Highlight categories like 'Dwelling', 'Outdoor
  Structure', and others from the provided data. This will help better understand
  the common locations where animal rescues are needed. Include percentages for each
  category to make the data clear. Ensure the chart is visually appealing with distinct
  colors and labels for each segment. This would be incredibly useful for our zoology
  team to focus on areas that need more attention in our upcoming report. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different segments
  of the pie chart?

  2. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for labels and percentages?

  3. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, do you have a preferred title?

  4. Do you prefer the percentages to be displayed inside the segments or outside
  with lines pointing to the segments?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the categories to be displayed
  (e.g., by size, alphabetical)?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend, and if so, where should it be placed
  (e.g., right, left, top, bottom)?

  7. Is there a specific style or theme you would like the chart to follow (e.g.,
  professional, playful, modern)?

  8. Would you like any additional information or annotations on the chart to provide
  context?'
