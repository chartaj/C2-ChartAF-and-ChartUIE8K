initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of customers
  based on their CreditScore from the Churn Modelling data. Include text annotations
  to highlight the average CreditScore and any noticeable peaks in the data. Use highlights
  to emphasize different ranges of CreditScores, such as low, medium, and high. This
  will help us understand the distribution and identify credit risk segments more
  efficiently. Thank you!

  of CreditScores (low, medium, high)?
