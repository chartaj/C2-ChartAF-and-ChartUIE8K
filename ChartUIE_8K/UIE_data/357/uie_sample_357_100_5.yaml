initial_prompt: Using the given customer churn modelling data, create a line chart
  to visualize the trends in the 'CreditScore' over the 'Age' of customers. The x-axis
  should represent 'Age', and the y-axis should represent 'CreditScore'. Add lines
  to differentiate between customers who have exited (Exited=1) and those who have
  not exited (Exited=0) the service. Include labels and a legend for clarity. This
  will help us to observe any correlations between age and credit score, and how they
  might relate to customer churn.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating customers who have
  exited (Exited=1) from those who have not (Exited=0)?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style of the lines (solid, dashed, etc.) representing
  different groups in the chart?

  3. Would you like any specific font styles or sizes for the labels and legend?

  4. Should there be any specific title for the overall chart and the axes?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to have grid lines for better readability?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to add to the chart?

  7. Would you prefer the data points to be highlighted along the line, or should
  the line be smooth without individual data points?

  8. Is there any particular order or sorting you''d like for the ''Age'' on the x-axis?

  9. Do you have a preference for the chart''s aspect ratio or size?'
