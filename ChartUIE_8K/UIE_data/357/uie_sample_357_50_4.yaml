initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap that shows the distribution of
  customer churn. Use the "Geography" data to mark regions and the "Exited" data to
  highlight the churn rate in each geographical area.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you have any specific regions or geographical areas that need to be highlighted?

  3. Would you like to include data labels on the heatmap to show the exact churn
  rate percentages?

  4. Do you prefer a specific map projection for the geographic regions?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradients?

  6. Is there a specific color gradient you prefer for indicating low to high churn
  rates?

  7. Do you want any particular annotations or markers on the map to highlight specific
  insights?

  8. What level of geographic detail do you prefer (e.g., country, state, city)?

  9. How would you like the boundaries of the regions to appear (e.g., solid lines,
  dashed lines)?

  10. Should the chart title explicitly state the purpose of the visualization, such
  as "Geographic Distribution of Customer Churn Rates"?'
