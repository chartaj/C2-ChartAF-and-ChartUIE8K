initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the Molecular
  Weight and Hydrophobicity for the Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins listed in the
  dataset. Make sure each column is represented in the histogram and clearly labeled.
  Use distinct colors for Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity and include a legend.
  The x-axis should represent the ranges of Molecular Weights and Hydrophobicity values,
  and the y-axis should represent the frequency of proteins falling into each range.
  This will help understand the variation within these properties for the proteins.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the distinct colors representing
  Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity?

  2. What specific range intervals would you like for Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity
  on the x-axis?

  3. Are there any specific title or axis labels you prefer for the histogram?

  4. Do you have a preference for the position of the legend on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  5. Would you like gridlines included in the histogram for better readability?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure about the specific range intervals.

  3. I do not have any specific title or axis labels in mind.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, I would like gridlines included for better readability.'
