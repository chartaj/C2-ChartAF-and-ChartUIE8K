initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the amino acid composition
  of different proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each bar represents a protein,
  and sections within the bar represent counts of each amino acid type. Annotate the
  chart with data-driven elements highlighting proteins with the highest and lowest
  molecular weights. Further, use highlights to differentiate between more and less
  hydrophobic proteins. This visualization aims to compare the composition and properties
  of these proteins, helping in biological analysis and interpretation. Make sure
  to label axes and proteins clearly for better understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for highlighting the
  different amino acids in the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you like the proteins with the highest and lowest molecular weights
  to be highlighted (e.g., different border colors, shadow effects)?

  3. What type of highlights would you prefer to differentiate between more and less
  hydrophobic proteins (e.g., color intensity, pattern fill)?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the order in which proteins are displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., sorted by molecular weight, alphabetical order)?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or labels for the axes and protein names
  (e.g., font size, font type)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the chart title and its placement?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different border colors for the highest and lowest molecular weights would be
  great.

  3. Color intensity would work well to differentiate between more and less hydrophobic
  proteins.

  4. Sorted by molecular weight, please.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
