initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity
  of proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Highlight proteins with exceptionally high
  or low values and annotate these points to draw attention to their specific data.
  The purpose is to study the variation in protein properties, especially focusing
  on their weight and hydrophobicity. Use different colors to differentiate between
  Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity bars. This will help in understanding the relationship
  between these properties across different proteins. Orientation text should provide
  context that these proteins are from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  between Molecular Weight and Hydrophobicity bars?

  2. Should the chart have a specific title, or would you prefer a default title based
  on the data attributes?

  3. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed side-by-side or stacked for each protein?

  4. How would you like the exceptionally high or low values to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different color, bold outline, etc.)?

  5. What level of detail would you like in the annotations for the highlighted points
  (e.g., just the value, additional protein information, etc.)?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  7. Is there a particular orientation (vertical or horizontal) you prefer for the
  bar chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the axis labels, annotations,
  and title?'
