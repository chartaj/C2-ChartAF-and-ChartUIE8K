initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of Molecular Weight
  and Isoelectric Point for Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins from the provided dataset.
  The box chart should have two separate boxes, one for Molecular Weight and one for
  Isoelectric Point, highlighting the median, quartiles, and any potential outliers.
  This will help us understand the variability and central tendencies of these properties
  among different proteins in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Ensure that axes are clearly
  labeled for better interpretation. Use the data summary and sample data provided
  for accurate plotting.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the boxes?

  2. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  3. Do you have preferences for the style of the whiskers on the box chart?

  4. Should outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color?

  5. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  6. Is there any specific information you would like to include in the chart legend?

  7. Would you like grid lines on the chart, and if so, do you have a preference for
  their style or color?

  8. Do you prefer the boxes to be vertically oriented or horizontally oriented?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include the title "Distribution of Molecular Weight and Isoelectric
  Point for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Proteins".

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, please mark outliers with a different color.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have specific information for the chart legend.

  7. Yes, I would like grid lines, but I do not have a preference for their style
  or color.

  8. Vertically oriented boxes would be preferred.'
