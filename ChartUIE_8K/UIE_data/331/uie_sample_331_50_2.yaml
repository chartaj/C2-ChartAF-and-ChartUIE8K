initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart comparing the Amino Acid Composition for
  each protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Highlighting the abundances of key amino
  acids helps in comparing their distribution across different proteins. Include annotations
  for molecular weight and isoelectric point for more context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette of the stacked
  bar chart?

  2. Would you like the amino acids to be grouped or categorized in any particular
  way?

  3. What level of detail would you prefer for the annotations of molecular weight
  and isoelectric point?

  4. Do you have a preferred placement for the annotations on the chart?

  5. Would you like to highlight certain amino acids more prominently in the chart?

  6. Are there any specific proteins you would like to focus on or highlight?

  7. Do you have any preference for the display of the legend and labels?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have a specific aspect ratio or size?

  9. Would you like any additional contextual information to be included in the chart,
  such as statistical summaries or notes?

  10. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?'
