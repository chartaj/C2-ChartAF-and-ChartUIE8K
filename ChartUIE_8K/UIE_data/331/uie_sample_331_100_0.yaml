initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between Molecular
  Weight and Isoelectric Point of Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins. Include text annotations
  for key data points, particularly those with extreme Molecular Weights or Isoelectric
  Points, to highlight their specific values. Use different colors to highlight proteins
  based on their Hydrophobicity values, emphasizing proteins with the highest and
  lowest Hydrophobicity scores. The purpose of this visualization is to better understand
  the distribution and correlation of molecular characteristics among the proteins,
  assisting in the identification of outliers and patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating proteins based
  on their Hydrophobicity values?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for key data points to be styled (font
  size, color, etc.)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific markers or shapes for the scatter plot points?

  4. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for Molecular Weight and Isoelectric
  Point that should be emphasized or highlighted?

  5. Should the axis titles and labels have a particular font style or size?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for Hydrophobicity
  values?

  7. Are there other specific data points or ranges, apart from extreme values, that
  you think should be highlighted?

  8. Do you prefer a particular layout or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  9. Should any gridlines or background shading be included in the scatter plot to
  enhance readability?'
answers: '<start of user response>

  1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, just ensure the text is readable.

  3. I do not know, any clear markers would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure, just standard styling should be okay.

  6. Yes, please include a legend.

  7. I do not think so.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. Yes, include gridlines to enhance readability.
