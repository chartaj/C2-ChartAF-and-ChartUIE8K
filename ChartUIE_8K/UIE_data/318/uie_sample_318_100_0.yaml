initial_prompt: I want a bar chart that shows the average hotel rating by star rating
  for hotels in Munnar, Kerala. The chart should also display annotations for the
  top 3 hotels with the highest number of reviews, highlighting their names and review
  counts. This will help me quickly identify which star rating tends to have better-rated
  hotels and which specific hotels are popular based on reviews. The purpose is to
  analyze the hotel ratings in relation to their star classifications and popularity.
  Please use the "Rating," "Star Rating," and "Reviews" columns for this visualization.
