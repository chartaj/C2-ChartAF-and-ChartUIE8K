02_initial_prompt: I want a line chart visualizing hotel price trends in Munnar, Kerala.
  Use "Hotel Name" on the x-axis and "Price" on the y-axis. Represent different star
  ratings (3-star, 4-star) with distinct lines to compare how prices vary across hotels
  with different ratings. Make sure to show the price including tax for accuracy.
  This helps in choosing hotels based on budget and star rating. For missing "Star
  Rating," do not exclude data but maybe mark as "Unrated" to retain completeness.
  Ensure the chart is clear and labels are readable for easier decision-making.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
