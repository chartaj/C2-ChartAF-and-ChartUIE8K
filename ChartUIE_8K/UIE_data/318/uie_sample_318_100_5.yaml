initial_prompt: Create a Treemap to visualize hotels based on their location in Munnar.
  Use 'Location' as the primary segment, and within each location, segment by 'Hotel
  Name'. Each hotel's size should reflect the number of 'Reviews' it has received.
  Color-code the hotels based on their 'Star Rating' to show quality. This chart will
  help travelers identify popular hotels in different areas and their quality at a
  glance. Ensure it's easy to interpret the number of reviews and star ratings for
  quick decision-making. This should help users find suitable accommodation in various
  parts of Munnar.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the star ratings?

  2. Should the treemap include labels for each hotel with their names and number
  of reviews, or just their names?

  3. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color codes for star ratings?

  4. Do you prefer a specific order (e.g., alphabetical, by number of reviews) for
  the hotels within each location?

  5. How detailed should the location segments be (e.g., neighborhoods, general areas)?

  6. Should the treemap display hover-over tooltips with additional information about
  each hotel (e.g., star rating, exact number of reviews)?

  7. Is it necessary for the chart to include a title and subtitle? If so, do you
  have any specific wording in mind?

  8. Should the sizes of the hotel segments be proportional to the number of reviews,
  or would you like a different scaling method?

  9. Do you need any supplementary information or notes about the hotels to be displayed
  within the treemap?

  10. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and text
  within the treemap?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific preference for the color scheme, so please choose
  a palette that makes the star ratings easy to distinguish.

  2. Just their names, please.

  3. Yes, please include a legend.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. General areas would be fine.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a title and subtitle would be useful. The title could be "Munnar Hotels
  Overview" and the subtitle "Popularity and Quality Ratings by Reviews".

  8. Sizes proportional to the number of reviews, please.

  9. I don''t think supplementary information is necessary within the treemap.

  10. I have no specific preference for font styles or sizes.'
