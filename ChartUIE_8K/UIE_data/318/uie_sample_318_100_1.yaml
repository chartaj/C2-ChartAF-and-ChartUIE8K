initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart that visualizes the hotels in Munnar, Kerala
  from MakeMyTrip data. Use the 'Rating' for the x-axis, 'Star Rating' for the y-axis,
  and 'Reviews' to determine the size of the bubbles. Color-code the bubbles based
  on the 'Rating Description'. Add text annotations to highlight bubbles with exceptionally
  high ratings, reviews, or notable locations. The chart should help travelers quickly
  identify the best-reviewed hotels at a glance, understand their star ratings, and
  correlate them with user reviews and overall rating descriptions. Ensure prominent
  bubbles stand out to draw attention instantly.
