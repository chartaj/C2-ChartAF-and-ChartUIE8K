02_initial_prompt: I want to visualize the performance outcomes of different teams
  across various years in a WWC tournament. Could you create a box plot that shows
  the distribution of scores for each team? Make sure to group the scores by team
  and denote different rounds, like 'Group' or other stages. The x-axis should represent
  different teams, and the y-axis should represent the scores. Including the round
  as a color or shape factor within the boxes would be great for distinguishing performance
  per stage. This way, we can see how team performance varies and identify any outliers
  or trends.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
