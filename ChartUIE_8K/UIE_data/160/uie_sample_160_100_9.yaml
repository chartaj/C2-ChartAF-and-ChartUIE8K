initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the provided "wwc_outcomes" data to visualize
  the relationship between the team scores and the game rounds across different years.
  Use the 'year' on the x-axis and 'score' on the y-axis. Differentiate the points
  based on the 'win_status' (Won, Lost, Draw) and use distinct markers or colors for
  each team. This scatter plot will help analyze performance trends of various teams
  over the years in different rounds. It should be visually appealing and easy to
  interpret with a clear legend.

  2. How would you like the win status (Won, Lost, Draw) to be represented (e.g.,
  specific colors, distinct markers)?

  4. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or style of the legend?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you prefer for the x-axis (year) and y-axis
  (score)?

  6. Would you like any gridlines to be present on the scatter plot?

  7. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axes labels and legend?

  8. Would you like to include labels or annotations for certain key points or data
  segments?

  9. How much emphasis would you like on the plot for the different rounds within
  each year?

  10. Are there any specific themes or visual styles you want to use for the overall
  look of the scatter plot?'
