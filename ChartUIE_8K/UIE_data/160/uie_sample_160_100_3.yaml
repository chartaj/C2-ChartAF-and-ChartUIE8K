initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the performance of different teams
  over the years in the WWC outcomes dataset. The x-axis should represent the years
  and the y-axis should show the scores. Each line should correspond to a different
  team. This way, we can observe and compare the trends of how each team performed
  year by year in terms of their scores. Make sure the legend distinguishes between
  the teams for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the lines representing different
  teams?

  2. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart (top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  3. Should there be any specific markers or symbols for data points on the lines?

  4. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability? If yes, should they
  be on both axes or just one?

  5. Are there any specific years or teams you would like to highlight or emphasize
  on the chart?

  6. Would you like to adjust the axis labels or title font sizes and styles? If so,
  what are your preferences?

  7. Should the chart include any annotations or notes for specific data points or
  trends?'
