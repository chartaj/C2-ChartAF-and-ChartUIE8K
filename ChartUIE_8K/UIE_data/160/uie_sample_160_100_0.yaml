initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the win status of teams from the given
  data on WWC outcomes in sports and recreation context. Highlight the segments showing
  'Won', 'Lost', and 'Draw' to emphasize their proportions. Additionally, annotate
  these segments with their respective percentages to draw attention to specific elements
  of the pie chart. This will help illustrate the distribution of game outcomes effectively
  and make it easier to understand the performance of different teams in various rounds.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the ''Won'', ''Lost'',
  and ''Draw'' segments?

  2. Would you like the pie chart to have a 3D effect or should it remain 2D?

  3. Should the chart include a legend or should we rely solely on the segment labels?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the percentages annotated on
  the chart segments?

  5. Would you like the chart title to be italicized, bold, or in any particular font
  size?

  6. Do you have a specific background color preference for the chart?

  7. Should the segment borders be highlighted or remain flat?

  8. Do you prefer the chart labels to be inside the segments or outside, connected
  with lines?

  9. Do you want the segments to be separated slightly (exploded view) to distinguish
  ''Won'', ''Lost'', and ''Draw'' more clearly?

  10. Is there a specific placement or format you prefer for the chart title?'
