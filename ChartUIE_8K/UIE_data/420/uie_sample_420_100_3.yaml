initial_prompt: Could you please help me create a histogram using the data from the
  given CSV? I'd like to visualize the distribution of bike counts over time. I'm
  particularly interested in seeing how frequently different counts occur. It would
  be helpful if you could also represent missing values in the dataset. This will
  help me understand the trends and gaps in bike usage. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Would you like to include a specific bin width for the histogram or should it
  be automatically determined?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be represented in the histogram?

  4. Do you have any specific labels or titles you want to be included in the histogram
  (e.g., chart title, axis labels)?

  5. Would you prefer the x-axis to be segmented by specific time intervals (e.g.,
  day, month, year)?

  6. Are there any specific gridlines or background styles you would prefer on the
  histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Automatically determined bin width is fine.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Please include a chart title like "Distribution of Bike Counts Over Time" and
  axis labels like "Bike Counts" for the y-axis and "Time" for the x-axis.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.'
