  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize bike and pedestrian counts from the dataset over time using a box chart.
  Annotate key time periods or outliers to highlight significant variations or trends.
  This helps in understanding peak hours or days for bike and pedestrian traffic.
  Summary statistics should also be displayed.
