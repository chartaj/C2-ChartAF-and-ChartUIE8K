initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing bike_count vs. date from the crossing
  data. Apply text annotations to indicate peak bike counts and highlight points where
  ped_count data is missing. This visualization helps identify trends and gaps in
  the bike count data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the x-axis (date) to be displayed in a specific date format (e.g.,
  YYYY-MM, MM/DD/YYYY)?

  3. How would you like the data points for missing ped_count to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different color, shape)?

  4. Do you have a specific style for the text annotations indicating peak bike counts
  (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  5. Should there be grid lines on the scatter plot? If yes, do you have preferences
  for their appearance (e.g., color, line style)?

  6. Would you like to include a title for the scatter plot? If so, do you have a
  preferred title?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels (e.g., label text, font size,
  color)?

  8. Should the peak bike counts be annotated with specific labels or just highlighted
  visually?

  9. Would you like to include a legend in the scatter plot? If yes, do you have any
  preferences for its appearance and placement?

  10. Is there a specific range or limit you would like to set for the y-axis (bike_count)
  to improve visualization?

  11. Would you prefer the use of markers for the scatter plot data points? If so,
  do you have any preferences for the marker style?'
