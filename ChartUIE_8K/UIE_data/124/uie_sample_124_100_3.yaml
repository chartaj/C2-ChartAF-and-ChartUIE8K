initial_prompt: I want to see a bar chart that compares the average points (pts) scored
  by players from different colleges. Use the college names on the x-axis and the
  average points on the y-axis. Make sure to show only the top 10 colleges with the
  highest average points. This will help me to see which colleges produce the highest
  scoring players in the NBA. The chart should be clear and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed in descending order of average points
  by default?

  3. Do you want the college names to be fully displayed on the x-axis, or should
  they be abbreviated if space is limited?

  4. Should there be data labels displaying the exact average points on top of each
  bar?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style or size used in the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a title and subtitle on the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Do you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  8. Do you want to include a legend, even if the categories are represented directly
  on the x-axis?

  9. How would you prefer the average points to be rounded? (e.g., one decimal place,
  two decimal places)'

  4. I am not sure.

  Scored in NBA". No subtitle is necessary.

  7. Yes, I prefer grid lines to be displayed for better readability.

  8. I do not think a legend is necessary since the categories are represented directly
  on the x-axis.
