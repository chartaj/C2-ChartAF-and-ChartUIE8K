initial_prompt: I'd like to create a scatter plot for NBA players' data. On the x-axis,
  plot the 'age' of the players, and on the y-axis, plot 'pts' (points). Each point
  on the scatter plot should represent a player. Differentiate the points by 'team_abbreviation'
  using different colors or symbols. Ensure the plot is easy to understand and includes
  a legend to indicate each team. Show trends or clusters in the data based on age
  and points scored to analyze player performance across different ages and teams.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color palette or color scheme
  to differentiate teams?

  2. Would you like the points to be represented by different symbols for each team,
  or is using different colors sufficient?

  3. Do you have a specific size preference for the points in the scatter plot?

  4. How would you prefer the trend lines to be displayed, if any (e.g., linear, polynomial)?

  5. Should the plot include any specific annotations or labels beyond the team abbreviations?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the plot for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer the axis labels and title to be in a specific font style or size?

  8. Would you like any specific markers or highlights for outliers or important data
  points?

  9. Is there any specific formatting you prefer for the legend (e.g., position, font
  size)?

  10. Should the axes have specific limits or scales (e.g., logarithmic scale)?'
