initial_prompt: I have a dataset of NBA players with various attributes like age,
  height, weight, college, and performance metrics like points, rebounds, assists,
  etc. I want to visualize the distribution of players' ages. Could you create a histogram
  that shows the frequency of players in different age groups? This will help me understand
  the age demographics of the players in the sample data. Please ensure that the age
  range is appropriately set to include all players and that the chart is labeled
  clearly with relevant titles and axis labels. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred age range or bin width for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the histogram bars to be colored in a specific color scheme?

  3. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the chart and axes?

  4. Should we include a legend or any additional annotations on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text labels and titles?

  6. Would you like the histogram to display gridlines for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred age range or bin width, just ensure
  it includes all players.

  2. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  3. Please label the chart title as "NBA Players'' Age Distribution" and the x-axis
  as "Age" and the y-axis as "Number of Players".

  4. I do not know if a legend or additional annotations are necessary.

  5. I do not have a preference for font style or size.

  6. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.'
