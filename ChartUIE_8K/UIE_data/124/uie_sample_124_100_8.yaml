initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare the average points (pts), rebounds
  (reb), and assists (ast) per game for players from different teams over multiple
  seasons. Group the bars based on the team abbreviations, and within each group,
  display bars for points, rebounds, and assists side-by-side. Label the x-axis with
  team abbreviations and the y-axis with the average values. This will help visualize
  team performance across various metrics. Ensure the chart is colorful and adds a
  legend for clarity. Highlight any significant differences between teams in these
  key performance indicators.

  major, minor, or both?'
