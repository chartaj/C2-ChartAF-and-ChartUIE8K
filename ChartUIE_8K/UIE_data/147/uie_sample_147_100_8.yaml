initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the "Languages spoken across various nations"
  data using a grouped bar chart. The x-axis should represent different countries
  and the y-axis should indicate the number of languages spoken in each country. Each
  bar should represent a language, and the bars should be grouped by country. This
  way, we can easily compare the variety and number of languages spoken in each country.
  Please include labels and a legend to identify the languages. The chart should be
  color-coded for easy differentiation among the languages.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the languages?

  2. How would you like the x-axis labels formatted, especially if country names are
  long?

  3. What level of detail do you prefer for the y-axis ticks (e.g., each unit, multiples
  of 5)?

  4. Are there specific fonts you would like to use for labels and legends?

  5. Should there be any specific ordering of the countries on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by the number of languages spoken)?

  6. Do you prefer any annotations or text boxes for highlighting specific data points
  or insights?

  7. Do you have any preference on the width or spacing of the bars within the grouped
  bar chart?

  8. Is there any additional information or metadata you would like included in the
  chart (e.g., source of data, date of data collection)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure, whatever works best for clarity.

  3. Multiples of 5 would be fine.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Alphabetical ordering of the countries would be preferred.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include the source of data and the date of data collection.'
