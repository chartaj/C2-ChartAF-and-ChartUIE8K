  Create a donut chart to visualize the languages spoken across various countries.
  Use text annotations to highlight specific languages spoken in selected countries
  like Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria. Employ highlights to distinguish official
  languages from other languages. This visualization will help understand the linguistic
  diversity stated in the data. Keep it concise and ensure annotations focus the viewerâ€™s
  attention on the highlighted data points. Include context related to the number
  of unique languages and ensure the chart is intuitive for literature and linguistics
  enthusiasts.
