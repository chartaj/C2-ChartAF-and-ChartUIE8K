- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Pictogram that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Pictogram that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

- Create a pictogram that visualizes the number of languages spoken in different countries.
  Use icons or symbols to represent different countries and different languages. The
  data should include country names and the number of languages spoken in each, as
  provided in the CSV file. Ensure that it's easy to compare the diversity of languages
  across the countries. Add legends and labels to make the chart informative. Make
  the pictogram colorful and engaging to highlight the linguistic diversity as mentioned
  in the data details. Ensure icons are distinct and correspond to specific language
  groups.
