initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showcasing the consumption of various food categories
  across different countries. Use text annotations to highlight key consumption patterns
  and draw attention to notable outliers. Adjust the color intensity to emphasize
  higher consumption values and use highlights for essential data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color scale be uniform or logarithmic?

  3. Do you prefer any specific ranges for the color intensity to emphasize higher
  consumption values?

  4. Are there any specific countries or food categories you want to be highlighted
  more prominently?

  5. Do you have a preferred font type or size for the text annotations?

  6. Should the text annotations be color-coded to match the heatmap colors?

  7. Do you want gridlines or borders around each cell in the heatmap?

  8. How would you like the outliers to be visually highlighted? (e.g., different
  color, bold border, special marker)

  9. Do you prefer the heatmap to be in a specific orientation (e.g., countries on
  x-axis, food categories on y-axis, or vice versa)?

  10. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to include in the
  chart?'
