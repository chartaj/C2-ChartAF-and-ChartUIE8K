09_answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, maybe around 3-4 countries per food category.

  3. Yes, can you highlight the USA, UK, China, and India?

  4. Percentages would be ideal.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include a title "Food Consumption by Country and Food Category" and
  a subtitle "Comparison of dietary composition across selected countries".

  9. No, that''s all I need. Thank you!'
