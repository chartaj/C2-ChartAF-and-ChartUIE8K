02_initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize food consumption by country.
  Each bar represents a country with segments for Red Meat, White Meat, Eggs, Milk,
  Fish, Cereals, Starch, Nuts, and Fruits & Vegetables, stacked to show total food
  consumption. Use annotations to highlight the countries with the highest and lowest
  consumption in each food category. This visualization helps compare dietary patterns
  across different countries. Emphasize the purpose of understanding food trends and
  nutritional balance globally. Keep the chart colorful and clear with labeled axes
  for better readability.
