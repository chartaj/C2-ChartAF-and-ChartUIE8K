initial_prompt: I have a dataset that shows Bitcoin USD stock market data from 2021
  to 2023, including columns for Year, Open, High, Low, and Close prices. I need the
  data visualized using a Candlestick chart. This chart should illustrate the opening,
  high, low, and closing prices of Bitcoin for each year in the dataset. Please ensure
  the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis represents the prices. The chart
  must clearly distinguish between bullish and bearish candlesticks. This visualization
  will help me analyze price trends and fluctuations of Bitcoin over these years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bullish and bearish candlesticks?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart to improve readability?

  3. Should there be any specific labels or annotations on the candlesticks to highlight
  key data points?

  4. Do you prefer specific fonts or font sizes for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Would you like a title and subtitle on the chart? If so, what should they be?

  6. Do you need any additional legends or explanatory notes on the chart?

  7. Should the chart include data markers or symbols on the candlesticks for better
  clarity?

  8. Do you want to visualize any moving averages or trend lines in addition to the
  candlestick data?'
