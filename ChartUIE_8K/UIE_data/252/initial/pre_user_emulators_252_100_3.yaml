- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a line chart to visualize the Bitcoin USD Stock Market data. The chart should
  have the Year on the x-axis and the Open, High, Low, Close prices on the y-axis.
  This will help us understand how the Bitcoin market trends over the years from 2021
  to 2023. Please make sure to highlight any significant changes in the prices to
  show market volatility. Use different colors for Open, High, Low, and Close lines
  to distinguish them clearly. Include a legend for clarity. Also, if possible, highlight
  data points with tooltips for exact values.
