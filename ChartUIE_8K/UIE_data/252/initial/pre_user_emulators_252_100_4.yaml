- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I have a dataset that shows Bitcoin USD stock market data from 2021 to 2023, including
  columns for Year, Open, High, Low, and Close prices. I need the data visualized
  using a Candlestick chart. This chart should illustrate the opening, high, low,
  and closing prices of Bitcoin for each year in the dataset. Please ensure the x-axis
  represents the years and the y-axis represents the prices. The chart must clearly
  distinguish between bullish and bearish candlesticks. This visualization will help
  me analyze price trends and fluctuations of Bitcoin over these years.
