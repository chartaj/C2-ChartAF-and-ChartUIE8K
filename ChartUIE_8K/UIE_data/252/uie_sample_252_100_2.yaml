initial_prompt: I want to create a bar chart visualizing the historical Bitcoin stock
  market data, showing the Open, High, Low, and Close prices from 2021 to 2023. Include
  text annotations on the highest and lowest bars to highlight significant values
  and trends. Utilize shape annotations like arrows or circles to emphasize key changes
  or patterns. This visualization aims to make it easier to understand the fluctuations
  in Bitcoin prices over the selected years, providing a clear and informative overview
  for investors and market analysts.

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped by month, quarter, or year?

  3. Do you prefer the annotations (text, arrows, circles) to be in a specific location
  or style?

  4. Should the bar chart include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Would you like to have a legend explaining the Open, High, Low, and Close prices?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  7. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, do you have specific
  wording for them?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s background color or theme (light/dark)?

  9. Do you want the bars to be displayed in 2D or 3D style?
