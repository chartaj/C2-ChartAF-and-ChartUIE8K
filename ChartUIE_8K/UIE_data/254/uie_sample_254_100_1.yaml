initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Ethereum's historical cryptocurrency
  data. Plot 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Price' on the y-axis. Use text annotations
  to display the 'High' and 'Low' values for selected dates, focusing on significant
  price changes. Highlight data points where the 'Change %' is notably high or low
  to emphasize major fluctuations. This visualization helps understand Ethereumâ€™s
  price trends, peaks, and troughs over time. Ensure annotations and highlights make
  it clear how price and volume influence market behavior, providing context for better
  decision-making and analysis for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting data points with significant
  price changes?

  2. Do you have any preference for the font style and size used in the text annotations?

  3. Would you like a specific date range to be focused on or any specific dates to
  be annotated?

  4. How would you like the data points with notable ''Change %'' to be visually distinguished
  (e.g., different shapes, colors, or sizes)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for axis labels and titles?

  6. Should grid lines be included or excluded in the scatter plot?

  7. Are there any specific visual elements or themes you would like to include in
  the chart to make it more engaging for cryptocurrency enthusiasts and investors?'
