initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Ethereum Cryptocurrency Historical
  Dataset. The heatmap should display correlations between 'Price', 'Open', 'High',
  'Low', 'Vol', and 'Change %' over time. Use the data provided in the CSV file (../Extra_datas/data/254.csv).
  Ensure the heatmap highlights how these variables affect each other, with varying
  color intensities representing the strength and direction of these relationships.
  This will help in identifying patterns and trends in the Ethereum market, assisting
  in better investment decisions. Please make the plot visually appealing and ensure
  all axes are properly labeled. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Is there a particular style or theme (e.g., minimalistic, bold, etc.) you would
  like for the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer the color scale to be a gradient from one color to another, or
  a multi-color scale?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to include annotations showing the exact correlation
  values?

  5. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for axis labels and titles?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color intensity?

  7. Do you want any specific gridlines or borders on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred orientation for the variable labels (e.g., horizontal, vertical)
  on the axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. A gradient from one color to another should be fine.

  4. Yes, I would like annotations showing the exact correlation values.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color intensity.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Horizontal orientation for the variable labels on the axes works for me.'
