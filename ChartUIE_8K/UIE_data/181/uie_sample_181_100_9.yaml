initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the attendance and revenue from Taylor
  Swift's Fearless Tour. Use the cities as rows and venues as columns, coloring the
  cells based on the number of tickets sold and revenue. Highlight missing data with
  a distinct color. This should help identify which locations had the highest and
  lowest turnout and revenue, and where we have gaps in the data. Can you make it
  visually appealing and easy to understand? Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the missing data to be highlighted (e.g., specific color or
  pattern)?

  3. Is there a particular font or style you prefer for the labels of cities and venues?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels to highlight high
  or low values?

  5. Do you prefer a particular layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Should the revenue be represented in a specific currency format or notation?

  7. Are there any additional details or context you want to be incorporated into
  the heatmap (e.g., tour dates, opening acts)?'
