initial_prompt: Visualize Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour using a Choropleth map. Highlight
  cities, venues, attendance, and revenue. Use annotations to emphasize sold-out shows
  and significant revenue. Focus on comparing attendance between different locations
  to understand markets' response.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like specific annotations styles? For example, icons, labels, or highlights
  for sold-out shows and significant revenue?

  3. Are there any specific regions or cities you want to emphasize more?

  4. Do you prefer displaying the numerical values of attendance and revenue directly
  on the map, or should these be accessed via tooltips or pop-ups?

  5. How detailed should the venue information be represented on the map?

  6. Should the scale of attendance and revenue be absolute or normalized (e.g., percentage)?

  7. Do you have a preference for the representation style of sold-out shows versus
  non-sold-out shows?

  8. Are there any additional data overlays or layers you want to include on the map
  (e.g., demographic information, geographic markers)?

  9. What level of granularity do you prefer for the map (e.g., state-level, city-level,
  or venue-level)?

  Tour or Taylor Swift that you would like to incorporate into the map design?'
