initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize Taylor Concert Tours ðŸŒŽ's impact
  on attendance and revenue. Use the data detailing city, country, venue, opening
  acts, tickets sold/available, revenue, and tour. Display cities on the x-axis, with
  grouped bars for attendance and revenue. Ensure clear differentiation between bars
  representing tickets sold/available and revenue. Include labels and legends for
  clarity. This visualization should highlight variations among different tour locations,
  emphasizing the total attendance versus venue capacity and the corresponding revenue
  generated across various cities. Keep the chart colorful and easy to interpret.
