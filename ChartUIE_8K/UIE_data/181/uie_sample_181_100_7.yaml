initial_prompt: I have provided CSV data about Taylor Swift's concert tours, including
  cities, countries, venues, opening acts, attendance, and revenue. I want to visualize
  how attendance and revenue vary across different venues and cities to understand
  the impact of her tours. Please create a stacked bar chart that displays the attendance
  and revenue for each venue listed in the sample data. Each bar should represent
  a venue with segments for attendance and revenue. Use distinct colors for attendance
  and revenue. Ensure the chart clearly shows comparison across venues. Please use
  labels and legends for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the distinct segments representing
  attendance and revenue?

  2. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the overall chart?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title or any additional annotations?

  5. Should the y-axis display the values in thousands (e.g., 10K) or as raw numbers?

  6. Do you prefer horizontal or vertical bars for the bar chart?

  7. Would you like to have any specific font style or size for labels and legends?

  8. Should the labels on the x-axis include both venue and city, or just the venue?

  9. Do you want to sort the venues in a specific order (e.g., by attendance, revenue,
  or alphabetically)?

  10. Would you prefer any additional information or data points to be included in
  the visualization?'
