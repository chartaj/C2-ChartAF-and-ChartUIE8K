initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing attendance and revenue for Taylor Swift's
  concert tours, including the "Fearless Tour," across various cities and venues.
  To analyze the data's impact visually, I'd like a pie chart that shows the distribution
  of total attendance for each city on the tour. The chart should highlight which
  cities had the highest and lowest attendance to help us understand market demand.
  Additionally, a separate pie chart focusing on the revenue distribution among these
  cities would be useful to compare financial performance. Please ensure each chart
  is clearly labeled and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie charts?

  2. Should the pie charts include percentage labels, total values, or both?

  3. How would you like the cities with the highest and lowest attendance/revenue
  to be highlighted (e.g., different colors, annotations)?

  4. Do you prefer the charts to be 2D or 3D?

  5. Would you like to display the legend inside or outside the pie chart?

  6. Is there a specific font or style preference for the chart labels and titles?

  7. Should the charts be sorted by attendance/revenue in descending order for better
  visual comparison?

  8. Do you want to include any additional data or notes in the charts?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Both percentage labels and total values would be useful.

  3. Different colors for the cities with the highest and lowest attendance/revenue
  would be good.

  4. I don''t know.

  5. Outside the pie chart.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, sorting by attendance/revenue in descending order would be helpful.

  8. No, no additional data or notes needed.'
