initial_prompt: Can you generate a histogram showing the distribution of attendance
  for Taylor Swift's "Fearless Tour"? I'd like the x-axis to display the number of
  tickets sold in different ranges, and the y-axis to indicate the frequency of those
  ranges. Please ensure the chart is clear and insightful by using appropriate labels
  and scales. Thank you!
questions: '1. What range intervals would you prefer for the number of tickets sold
  on the x-axis?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  5. Do you want to display the exact numbers on the bars to indicate frequency?

  6. Should the y-axis use a linear or logarithmic scale?

  7. Are there any particular labels or annotations you would like to add to the chart?'
