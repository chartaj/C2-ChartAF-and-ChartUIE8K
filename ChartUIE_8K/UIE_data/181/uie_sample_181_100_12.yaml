initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visually represent the attendance variations
  across different cities for Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour. Please use the data provided
  to plot the attendance figures (tickets sold / available) for different cities and
  venues. Make sure to highlight any outliers and provide median, quartiles, and range.
  Clearly label the city, venue, and attendance on the x and y axes. The goal is to
  understand how attendance varied across different tour stops and identify any significant
  deviations. Include a legend and proper title for clarity. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the box
  chart?

  2. Would you like to see the cities listed alphabetically or by attendance figures
  on the x-axis?

  3. Do you prefer the box chart to include individual data points along with the
  outliers?

  4. Is there a particular format for the legend that you prefer?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you want for the title and axis labels?

  6. Should the venues be included as part of the labels on the x-axis or in the legend?

  7. Do you want a specific style or format for highlighting the outliers?'
