initial_prompt: 'I want a line chart that visualizes the attendance and revenue trends
  over multiple cities for Taylor Swift''s Fearless Tour. Use the ''City'' on the
  x-axis and both ''Attendance (tickets sold / available)'' and ''Revenue'' on separate
  y-axes. The goal is to see how attendance numbers and revenue correspond in each
  city she performed. Make sure to highlight any missing values or data points. Title
  the chart "Taylor Swift Fearless Tour: Attendance and Revenue" and provide legends
  for each line. Include markers for each data point. Thank you!'

  ''Attendance'' and ''Revenue''?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the chart title and legends?

  4. Should there be any specific highlighting or style for missing values or data
  points?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reference, and if so, should
  they be more prominent for one of the axes?

  and right sides of the chart respectively, or do you have a different preference?

  7. Is there a particular style you prefer for the overall chart (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, corporate)?
