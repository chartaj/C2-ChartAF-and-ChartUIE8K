initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing IL (25°C), toluene (25°C), and
  n-heptane (25°C) for each sample (No.). Annotate with specific data values for a
  few bars to highlight significant points. Utilize colors and varying bar sizes to
  emphasize differences. Chemistry context means the chart helps visualize solvents'
  behavior at 25°C, aiding comparative analysis. Highlight the most notable differences
  across solvents. Keep it visually clear and ensure annotations don't clutter the
  chart. Use distinct colors for each solvent to make comparison straightforward.
  This approach helps in quickly identifying key details in the chemical data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for each solvent toluene, n-heptane,
  and IL (25°C)?

  2. Which specific data values would you like to annotate on the bars to highlight
  significant points?

  3. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for bar sizes to emphasize differences?

  4. How would you prefer the significant differences to be highlighted (e.g., bold
  labels, arrows, different shades)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order of the grouped bars (e.g., IL first, followed
  by toluene and n-heptane)?

  6. Are there any preferred font styles or sizes for the annotations to ensure they
  don’t clutter the chart?

  7. Do you want gridlines in the background to ease comparison, or would you prefer
  a cleaner look?

  8. How detailed do you want the axis labels to be (e.g., ''IL (25°C)'' vs. ''Ionic
  Liquid at 25°C'')?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific colors. Maybe something like blue, red,
  and green?

  2. I would like to annotate the highest and lowest data values for each solvent
  group to highlight significant points.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Bold labels and arrows for significant differences would be good.

  5. IL first, followed by toluene and n-heptane would be fine.

  6. I am not sure, just ensure annotations are clear and don''t clutter the chart.

  7. I do not know.

  8. ''Ionic Liquid at 25°C'', ''Toluene at 25°C'', and ''n-Heptane at 25°C'' would
  be best.'
