initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the relationship between temperature
  and the concentrations of IL, toluene, and n-heptane. Use different lines to represent
  each variable and add text annotations to highlight the significant data points.
  The purpose is to understand how each substance's concentration varies with temperature.
  Highlight the points where abrupt changes occur to emphasize them. This visualization
  will help in analyzing the chemical properties and interactions of these substances
  under different conditions. Ensure clarity and readability by using distinct colors
  and markers for each line.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the lines representing IL, toluene,
  and n-heptane?

  2. Are there specific markers you prefer for each line (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations be placed at specific locations (e.g., above the
  data points, to the right)?

  5. Do you require a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  6. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for each variable?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have grid lines, and what style should they be?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels'' font style and size?

  9. Would you like specific axis limits or ranges to be set for the x-axis (temperature)
  and y-axis (concentration)?

  10. Are there any specific data points or temperature ranges you would like to highlight
  more prominently?

  11. Is there a title you would like to use for the chart, and do you have a preference
  for its placement and style?

  12. Would you like tooltips or hover text to display additional information when
  hovering over the data points?'
