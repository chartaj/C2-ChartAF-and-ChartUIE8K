initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the temperature-dependent solubility
  data for IL, toluene, and n-heptane at 25°C. Highlight notable points, annotate
  specific data values to emphasize differences, and display overall trends. Make
  it clear for chemistry context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled with specific units or titles?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style of markers for notable points (e.g., circles,
  triangles, squares)?

  5. Are there any specific data values or points you would like to highlight or annotate?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between IL, toluene, and n-heptane?

  7. Do you want any trend lines or fitted curves added to the chart?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for annotations and labels?

  9. Would you like to include error bars or any indication of variability in the
  data?

  10. Do you prefer a specific background color or style for the chart to align with
  chemistry contexts?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Temperature (°C)" and the y-axis should be
  labeled "Solubility (g/L)".

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Circles for notable points would be fine.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between IL, toluene, and n-heptane.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
