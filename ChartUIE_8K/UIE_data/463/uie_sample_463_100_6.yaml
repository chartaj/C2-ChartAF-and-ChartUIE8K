initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the data provided in the CSV file.
  The chart should visualize the distribution of values for "IL (25°C)", "toluene
  (25°C)", and "n-heptane (25°C)". Each of these variables should be represented as
  separate boxes in the chart. This will help us understand the spread and central
  tendency of these variables. Ensure the box chart clearly shows the quartiles, median,
  and any outliers for each variable. The x-axis should represent the different variables,
  and the y-axis should represent the values. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the box
  chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability of the
  quartiles and median values?

  3. Should the chart display individual data points in addition to the box plots
  to visualize the raw data distribution?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style and format of the outliers in the box
  chart?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you would like to set for the y-axis?

  6. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the chart to
  highlight any key points or observations?

  7. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?

  8. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the chart (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  boxes)?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the spacing between the boxes on the x-axis?'
