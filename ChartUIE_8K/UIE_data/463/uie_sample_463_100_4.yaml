initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart using the data provided. The radar chart
  should include the "IL (25°C)", "toluene (25°C)", and "n-heptane (25°C)" columns.
  Each axis represents one of these substances. Plot all the data points, with each
  line representing a different "No." value. Ensure the chart clearly shows the distribution
  and concentration differences between these substances at 25°C. Highlight any significant
  values or outliers. This will help in visualizing the comparative presence of each
  substance in different samples. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels for each data point?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style or format for highlighting outliers?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the lines representing
  different "No." values?

  5. Is there a specific way you would like the axes to be labeled or formatted?

  6. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should the chart include a title and/or subtitle? If so, do you have specific
  text in mind?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used in the chart?

  9. Would you like to add any annotations or comments directly on the chart to highlight
  specific points?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the axis range or scaling of the chart?'
