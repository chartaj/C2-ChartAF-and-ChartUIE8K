initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart displaying solvent compositions at 25째C.
  Annotate with specific data values, highlighting significant contrasts between solvents
  and unique values. Emphasize any outliers. This will help in studying the distribution
  and usage of solvents in the given dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different solvents (IL,
  toluene, n-heptane) in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the significant contrasts and unique values to be highlighted
  in a specific way (e.g., with bold annotation or different colors)?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be emphasized (e.g., with a different marker
  or color)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the bar chart (horizontal or vertical)?

  5. Should the data values be displayed on the bars or outside the bars?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the axis labels and titles (e.g., font size,
  font type, color)?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart, and if so, where would you
  prefer it to be placed (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Should there be any specific gridlines or reference lines included in the chart
  to aid in comparison?

  9. Do you have a preferred format for the numbers (e.g., decimal places, percentage)?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes that you would like to include
  in the chart?'
