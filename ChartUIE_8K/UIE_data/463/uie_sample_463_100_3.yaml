initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between
  IL (25°C), toluene (25°C), and n-heptane (25°C) from the data given. Plot IL (25°C)
  on the x-axis and toluene (25°C) on the y-axis, with points sized based on the values
  of n-heptane (25°C). This visualization will help understand how IL and toluene
  concentrations correlate and how n-heptane fits into the mixture at 25°C. Ensure
  no missing data is present in the scatter plot, and use different colors to distinguish
  overlapping points for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like the sizes of the points to be proportional to specific ranges
  or scaled uniformly?

  3. Are there any specific color codes you want to use for distinguishing overlapping
  points?

  4. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the scatter plot?

  5. How would you prefer the legend to be displayed regarding point sizes (representing
  n-heptane values)?

  6. Should axis labels include units (e.g., ''IL (25°C)'')?

  7. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you would like for the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for labels and titles?

  9. Would you like to add trend lines or best-fit lines to the scatter plot?

  10. Should any specific range be highlighted on the x-axis and y-axis?

  11. Are there any annotations you would like to add to specific data points?'
