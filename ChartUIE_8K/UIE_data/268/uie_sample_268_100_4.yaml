initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the population trends of different districts
  in Bangladesh from 1991 to 2022. The heatmap should display district names on one
  axis and years on the other, with colors representing population sizes. Please ensure
  that the color gradient effectively highlights differences in population sizes across
  years for each district. The dataset includes columns for district name, abbreviation,
  division, established date, native name, area in km2, and population figures for
  the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022. This will be very useful for understanding
  demographic changes over time. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color gradient used in the heatmap
  (e.g., blue to red, green to yellow)?

  2. Should the color gradient be linear or logarithmic to highlight population differences?

  3. Do you want specific annotations on the heatmap, such as the exact population
  numbers or percentage changes?

  4. How should low and high population values be represented in the color gradient
  (e.g., lighter colors for low values and darker colors for high values)?

  5. Do you need additional labels or markers for specific years or districts?

  6. Are there any particular districts or years you want to highlight or emphasize
  in the heatmap?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the districts on the axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  population size)?

  8. What is the preferred size or resolution of the heatmap for better readability?'
