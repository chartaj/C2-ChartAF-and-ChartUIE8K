initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map of Bangladesh districts showing population
  changes over time. Use the provided CSV data on districts with columns like Name,
  Established, and Population metrics from 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022. Highlight the
  changes in population density for each district across these years. Color-code districts
  based on their population values. Ensure that the map is visually intuitive, with

  detailed population figures and district information when hovering over each district.
