02_initial_prompt: Visualize a line chart showing population trends across different
  districts in Bangladesh from 1991 to 2022. Each line represents a district, and
  the x-axis is the year while the y-axis shows population numbers. Use text annotations
  to highlight key population changes in years 2001 and 2022 for specific districts,
  and highlight trends in districts with significant growth. The purpose is to analyze
  population growth patterns and regional development. This visualization will help
  in social science research and policy planning by showing how different regions
  have evolved demographically over time.
