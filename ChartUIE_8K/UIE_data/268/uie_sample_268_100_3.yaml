initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart to visualize the population growth of different
  districts in Bangladesh over the years 1991, 2001, 2011, and 2022. Please use distinct
  colors for each year and label the axes appropriately. Ensure the districts are
  listed on the x-axis, and the population numbers are on the y-axis. Also, include
  a legend to differentiate between the years. The chart should clearly show population
  trends across the years for each district to analyze growth patterns effectively.
  Remember to keep the design clean and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct colors representing
  each year?

  2. How do you want the legend to be positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  3. Would you like to include any specific title for the chart?

  4. Is there any particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  5. Do you want gridlines displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the y-axis be displayed with a specific range or scale (e.g., logarithmic
  scale)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific width for the bars in the grouped bar chart?

  8. Would you like the values of each bar to be displayed on top of the bars?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or highlights you want to include in the
  chart?

  10. Is there a specific order in which the districts should be displayed on the
  x-axis?'
