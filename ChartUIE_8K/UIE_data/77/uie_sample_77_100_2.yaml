initial_prompt: Visualize the Most Streamed Spotify Songs of 2023 using a line chart.
  Plot streams over time (released_year, released_month, released_day). Highlight
  significant dips or spikes in streams. Add text annotations to key data points for
  top songs like "Seven (feat. Latto) (Explicit Ver.)", "LALA," and "vampire" to showcase
  their streaming trajectory. Use different line colors for each song. Ensure data
  contextâ€”focus on how song releases and playlist inclusions impact streams, highlighting
  elements like energy or danceability to provide insights into their streaming success.
  This helps visualize trends and patterns in 2023's music streaming landscape.
