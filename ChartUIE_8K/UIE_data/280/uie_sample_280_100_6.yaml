initial_prompt: I need a stacked area chart that shows the religious population trends
  over time in the United States. The x-axis should represent the years, and the y-axis
  should show the population in millions. Each segment in the stack should represent
  a different religion or religious denomination (e.g., Protestants, Roman Catholics,
  Eastern Orthodox, etc.). Highlight the trends for major religions like Christianity,
  Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Non-Religious groups. Ensure the chart clearly shows
  how the populations of these groups have changed from 1945 to 1955. Use vivid colors
  for each religion for easy distinction.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the specific colors to use for each
  religion?

  2. Would you like to include a legend in the chart to help identify the different
  religions?

  3. Should the chart display gridlines for better readability?

  4. Do you want data labels on the chart to show exact population values for each
  year?

  5. How should the x-axis be labeled? Specific years, intervals (e.g., every 2 years)?

  6. Do you have a specific font preference for the chart text (e.g., axis labels,
  titles)?

  7. Is there a specific title you want for the chart?

  8. How would you prefer the segments to be ordered in the stack (e.g., from largest
  population to smallest, or a specific order)?'
