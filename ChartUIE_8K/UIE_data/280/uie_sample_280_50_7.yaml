initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the population trends of different religions
  in the United States from 1945 to 1955. Include Christianity (Protestants, Roman
  Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican), Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Non-Religious
  populations. Add a legend to differentiate the religious groups and ensure the x-axis
  represents the years while the y-axis represents population.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different religious groups
  in the line chart?

  2. Would you like specific line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) for different religions
  or should they all be solid lines?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style and size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Should the y-axis be displayed with a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic) or unit?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the chart to highlight
  key events or trends?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be in the background or
  foreground?

  7. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If yes, do you have any preferences
  for their text?

  8. Do you want the legend to be placed in a specific location (e.g., top right,
  bottom left) on the chart?

  9. Would you like to display data points as markers on the lines?
