initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the populations of various religions
  in the United States from 1945 to 1955. Use different shades to represent the population
  sizes for Christianity (Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox, Anglican, Others), Judaism
  (Orthodox, Conservatives, Reform, Others), Islam (Sunni, Shi'a, Ibadhi, Nation of
  Islam, Alawite, Ahmadiyya, Others), Buddhism (Mahayana, Theravada, Others), and
  other religions. Include a legend to show what each shade represents. Label the
  years on the x-axis and the religious groups on the y-axis, ensuring readability
  and clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used in the
  heatmap?

  2. Are there specific shades or colors you want to use for representing different
  population sizes?

  3. How detailed would you like the legend to be? Should it include numerical ranges
  or descriptive labels?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels on the x-axis and
  y-axis to ensure readability?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the heatmap for better alignment of data
  points?

  6. Do you have a preferred orientation for the labels on the x-axis (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  7. Is there a specific order you want the religions to appear on the y-axis?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include in the
  heatmap?

  9. Would you prefer the heatmap to also display the actual population numbers within
  each cell for more clarity?

  10. Do you have specific preferences for the layout of the heatmap (e.g., aspect
  ratio, margins)?'
