  <start of data visualization instruction>

  Create a heatmap visualizing the populations of various religions in the United
  States from 1945 to 1955. Use different shades to represent the population sizes
  for Christianity (Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox, Anglican, Others), Judaism (Orthodox,
  Conservatives, Reform, Others), Islam (Sunni, Shi''a, Ibadhi, Nation of Islam, Alawite,
  Ahmadiyya, Others), Buddhism (Mahayana, Theravada, Others), and other religions.
  Include a legend to show what each shade represents. Label the years on the x-axis
  and the religious groups on the y-axis, ensuring readability and clarity.
