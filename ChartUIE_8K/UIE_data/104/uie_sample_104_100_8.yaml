initial_prompt: I'd like a density plot visualizing the distribution of the 'Close'
  prices from the Jumia Stock Data. Please use the data from all the dates provided.
  Additionally, overlay the density curves for 'Open', 'High', and 'Low' prices for
  comparison. Make sure each density curve is clearly distinguishable using different
  colors or line styles. Add a legend to indicate which curve corresponds to which
  stock price type. Include appropriate labels for the x-axis (Stock Prices) and y-axis
  (Density). The chart will help to compare the variability and distribution of these
  stock price metrics over time. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each of the ''Open'',
  ''High'', ''Low'', and ''Close'' price density curves?

  2. Do you prefer solid, dashed, or dotted line styles for distinguishing between
  the density curves?

  3. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, please specify.

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the chart labels and
  legend?

  5. Is there a specific scale or range you would prefer for the x-axis (Stock Prices)
  and y-axis (Density)?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, do you have any preferences for
  their style or color?

  7. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific part of the chart (e.g.,
  top right, bottom left)?

  8. Is there any additional text or annotation you would like included in the chart?'
