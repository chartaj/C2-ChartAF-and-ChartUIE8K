initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing Jumia's stock price movements. Include
  bars for the Open, High, Low, and Close prices for selected dates to show variations.
  Use text annotations to display precise values on the bars for easy reference. Highlight
  significant changes or unusual volumes to draw attention. This chart helps in understanding
  Jumia's stock trend over time, providing a clear visual representation for business
  analysis. Keep the chart clean and focused, emphasizing the key data points without
  overwhelming the viewer. Ensure the dates are displayed on the x-axis, and prices
  on the y-axis.

  2. Are there specific dates that are of particular interest to you?

  (e.g., different bar colors, markers, etc.)

  5. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars and annotations?

  6. Should the text annotations show values in a specific format or precision (e.g.,
  two decimal places)?

  7. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the x-axis, y-axis, and chart
  title?

  8. Are there specific benchmarks (e.g., average prices, daily volume thresholds)
