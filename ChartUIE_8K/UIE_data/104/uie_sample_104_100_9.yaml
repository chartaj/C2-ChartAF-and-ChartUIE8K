initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing Jumia's stock price data, with information
  on dates, opening prices, highs, lows, closing prices, adjusted closes, and trading
  volumes. I want to visualize this data using a column chart. Please create a column
  chart displaying the closing prices over time, with dates on the x-axis and closing
  prices on the y-axis. Ensure that each column represents a different date from the
  dataset. Additionally, include labels for clarity. This will help me to track how
  the closing prices have changed over the given period. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the column chart?

  2. Would you like the dates on the x-axis to be displayed in a specific date format
  (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YYYY)?

  3. Should the y-axis have a specific scale (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels?

  6. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If yes, what should it be?

  7. Should the columns have any particular width or spacing between them?

  8. Do you prefer any specific positioning for the legend (if needed)?

  9. Would you like to see annotations for significant events or data points on the
  chart?

  10. Do you want to include any reference lines or markers, such as average closing
  price or previous closing prices?'
