initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations between different game
  statistics for League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games. Include variables like blueKills,
  blueDeaths, blueAssists, redKills, redDeaths, redAssists, blueWardsPlaced, and redWardsPlaced.
  Highlight strong correlations in the heatmap with a distinct color gradient. Ensure
  to label axis for clarity and add a color bar legend. Display data for both teams
  in the heatmap to see how their actions correlate throughout the games. Use a cool-to-warm
  color scheme to make differences in correlation values more distinguishable.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or text within the heatmap?

  3. Are there any specific axis labels or names you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of correlation values in the color gradient?

  5. Are there any specific color shades or tones you would like included in the cool-to-warm
  color scheme?

  6. Would you like to display values within the cells of the heatmap (e.g., numerical
  correlation values)?

  7. How detailed do you want the axis ticks and labels to be?

  8. Is there a preferred positioning for the color bar legend?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the title.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I prefer simple axis labels like "Game Statistics".

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include the numerical correlation values within the cells of the
  heatmap.

  7. Detailed enough to distinguish between the different game statistics clearly.

  8. I am not sure.'
