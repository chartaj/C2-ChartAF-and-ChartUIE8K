initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the comparison between
  blue and red teams in League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games (10 min). Use variables
  like kills, deaths, assists, total gold, and towers destroyed. Separate each variable
  into blue and red segments for easy comparison. The x-axis should represent the
  different variables, and the y-axis should show the counts or amounts. Ensure each
  bar clearly distinguishes the performance of blue and red teams across the multiple
  game IDs present in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the blue team and red team
  segments?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on each segment of the stacked bar for
  precise values?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and title?

  4. Should the bars be ordered in a specific way, such as by the sum of the blue
  and red values, or alphabetically by variable?

  5. Would you like to add grid lines to the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to have on the chart?

  7. Do you want to include a legend, and if so, any preference on its position (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis include specific labels or units of measurement?

  9. Do you have any preference for the bar width or spacing between bars?

  10. Would you like to highlight any specific variables or data points in the chart?'
