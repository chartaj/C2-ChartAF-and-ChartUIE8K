initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the distribution of 'blueTotalGold' for
  different 'blueWins'. Use text annotations to highlight key gold amounts and include
  shape annotations like arrows to point out significant gold differences. This will
  help visualize how gold correlates with winning or losing in League of Legends Diamond
  Ranked Games.

  2. What specific gold amounts would you like highlighted with text annotations?

  3. Are there any specific significant gold differences you want the arrows to point
  out?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to indicate what the annotations represent?

  6. Do you prefer any specific bin size for the histogram?

  7. Is there a particular layout or orientation you prefer for the histogram (e.g.,
  vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Should the histogram include grid lines for easier reading?

  9. Do you want to add titles or labels to the axes, and if so, what should they
  be?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the overall dimensions or aspect ratio of the
  histogram?'
