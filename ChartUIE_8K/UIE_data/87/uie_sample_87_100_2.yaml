initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'blueKills' and
  'redKills' from the League of Legends Diamond Ranked Games data. Use text annotations
  to highlight the average number of kills for both blue and red teams. Add shape
  annotations, such as arrows or lines, to emphasize any significant differences between
  blue and red team kills. The purpose of this visualization is to compare the killing
  performance of the two teams within the first 10 minutes of the game and draw insights
  into their early game strategies.
