initial_prompt: Create a violin plot for JoJo Stands stats data, showing distributions
  of power (PWR), speed (SPD), range (RNG), persistence (PER), precision (PRC), and
  development (DEV) with respect to the various Stands.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the violin plot?

  2. Should the plot display data points overlaid on the violins?

  3. Do you prefer the violins to be horizontally or vertically oriented?

  it located?

  5. Do you want to display summary statistics (e.g., mean, median) within each violin
  plot?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the stats (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC,
  DEV) to be displayed in?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis labels and title styling (e.g., font size,
  font family)?

  8. Should the plot display grid lines or be grid-free?

  9. Would you like any annotations or highlights to emphasize specific parts of the
  data?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the Y-axis?'
