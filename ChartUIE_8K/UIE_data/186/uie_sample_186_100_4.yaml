initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of missing
  values across each column in the dataset 'JoJo Stands Stats'. The chart should display
  the columns on the outer ring and the number of missing values they each contain
  in the inner section. This will help in understanding which attributes of the stands
  have the most incomplete data. Highlight the columns with the highest number of
  missing values to easily identify data quality issues. Label each section clearly
  for better interpretation of the data context within the arts-and-entertainment
  domain.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the highlighted columns with the highest number of missing values have
  a specific color or gradient?

  3. Would you like to display the actual number of missing values in each section
  of the donut chart?

  4. How would you prefer the sections to be labeled - by column names or more descriptive
  titles?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color or design?

  parts of the chart?'
