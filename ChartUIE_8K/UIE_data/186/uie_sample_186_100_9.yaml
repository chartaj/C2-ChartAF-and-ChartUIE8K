initial_prompt: I would like to visualize the summary of JoJo Stands Stats using a
  Treemap. The Treemap should display the unique values for each attribute (PWR, SPD,
  RNG, PER, PRC, DEV) from the dataset. Each unique value should be a rectangle, and
  its size should represent the count of that unique value across the dataset. Additionally,
  missing values should be highlighted distinctly. This visualization will help in
  understanding the distribution and missing data points in the JoJo Stands Stats
  more intuitively. Ensure the labels and legends are clear to differentiate among
  the attributes and their unique values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Treemap?

  2. How would you like missing values to be highlighted? (e.g., specific color, pattern,
  etc.)

  3. Do you want the rectangles representing unique values to have any specific borders
  or outlines for better differentiation?

  4. Should the Treemap display any specific tooltips or labels when hovering over
  different sections?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  6. Would you like the Treemap to have a title and subtitle? If yes, what should
  they be?

  7. Do you have a preference for the layout or arrangement of the Treemap (e.g.,
  squarified, slice-and-dice, etc.)?

  8. Should the count of each unique value be shown within the rectangles or only
  in the legend?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. A specific color for missing values would be ideal.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, the title should be "JoJo Stands Stats Treemap" and the subtitle should
  be "Distribution and Missing Values Highlighted".

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. The count of each unique value should be shown within the rectangles.'
