initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize JoJo Stands Stats. Use the Stand
  names as the categories on the x-axis. For each Stand, create columns for PWR, SPD,
  RNG, PER, PRC, and DEV on the y-axis. Highlight Missing Values with a distinct color
  to emphasize data gaps. Add text annotations to specific data points to highlight
  interesting statistics or deviations from the norm. The chart will help to compare
  different attributes of various Stands while also pointing out where data is incomplete.
  The purpose is to identify each Standâ€™s strengths and weaknesses quickly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you want to
  use for the different attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, DEV)?

  2. What specific color would you like to use to highlight the missing values?

  3. Are there particular data points that you already know of that you would like
  to annotate with text?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color,
  position)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific order for the Stand names on the x-axis, such as alphabetical
  or by a particular attribute''s value?

  6. Would you like the columns for each attribute to be grouped or stacked?

  7. Are there any specific legend settings or custom labels you prefer?

  8. Do you have a preferred font or style for the axis labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know of any specific data points to annotate.

  4. I am not sure, just make them clear and readable.

  5. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  6. I would prefer the columns for each attribute to be grouped.

  7. I have no specific preference for legend settings or custom labels.

  8. I have no specific preference for the font or style for the axis labels and title.'
