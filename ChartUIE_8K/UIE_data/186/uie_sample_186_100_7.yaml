initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visually represent the stats from
  the JoJo Stands data. Each Stand should be represented as a point on the plot. Use
  the unique values and their associated counts for PWR, SPD, RNG, PER, PRC, and DEV
  as the coordinates. Try to visualize any patterns or clusters that may exist within
  these Stands based on their attributes. Ensure that each axis is labeled clearly
  with corresponding attributes. Color-code the points based on the Stand's name if
  possible. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for color-coding the
  points based on the Stand''s name?

  2. How would you like the size of the points to be represented in the scatter plot?

  3. Do you prefer a specific shape for the points, such as circles, squares, or triangles?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and plot
  title?

  5. Do you need grid lines to be displayed on the plot, and if so, do you have a
  preference for their appearance?

  6. Would you like to annotate the points with any additional information, such as
  the Stand''s name or attribute values?

  7. Do you have a preference for the range of values for each axis, or should it
  be automatically determined based on the data?

  8. How much spacing would you prefer between points if their values are the same
  or very similar?

  9. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to add to the scatter plot?'
