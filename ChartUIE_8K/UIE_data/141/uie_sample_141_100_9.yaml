initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for the Economic Freedom of the World dataset.
  X-axis should be 'year' and Y-axis 'ECONOMIC FREEDOM'. Each point represents a country
  with ISO_code as labels. Additionally, color-code the points based on the 'quartile'
  value to illustrate different quartiles. Include a legend for the quartiles and
  ensure the chart is easy to interpret. Use tooltips to show detailed data (e.g.,
  'rank', 'country', and 'ECONOMIC FREEDOM') when hovering over a point. This will
  help visualize the economic freedom trends over the years for different countries
  and quartiles. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different quartiles?

  2. Would you like a specific range for the X-axis (''year'') or Y-axis (''ECONOMIC
  FREEDOM'')?

  3. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to highlight on the
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer specific marker shapes for the data points representing each quartile?

  5. Do you require grid lines on the chart, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for their appearance?

  6. Would you like the chart to have a title or any additional annotations?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the font type and size for the labels and
  legend?

  8. Should the legend be positioned in a specific part of the chart (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Grid lines would be helpful, but I have no specific preference for their appearance.

  6. Yes, a title like "Economic Freedom Trends Over the Years" would be good.

  7. I do not know.
