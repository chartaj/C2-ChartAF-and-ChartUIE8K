initial_prompt: 'Please create box charts to visualize the Economic Freedom data,
  focusing on the different categories: size of government, property rights, sound
  money, trade freedom, and regulation across countries and years. Highlight outliers
  for each country. Use quartiles to show the distribution of economic freedom scores.
  The data covers various indicators such as government consumption, transfers, and
  taxes, judicial independence, inflation, tariffs, and business regulations. Analyze
  trends and differences across the countries, using the Economic Freedom of the World
  dataset. Ensure the charts are clear and easy to interpret for comparative analysis.'

  2. Would you like to see individual data points along with the quartiles in the

  markers)?

  4. Do you want the charts to display mean or median values in addition to the quartile

  chart, multiple categories per chart)?

  6. Would you like to include country labels in the charts for better identification?

  7. Is there a specific order in which you want the countries to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by ranking)?

  8. Should the charts include trend lines or annotations to highlight significant
  trends or comparisons?'
