initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart that depicts the Economic Freedom index
  of various countries over the year 2016. Use the 'ECONOMIC FREEDOM' and 'countries'
  columns to visualize the data. Also, highlight key metrics such as 'size_government',
  'property_rights', 'sound_money', and 'regulation'. The chart should allow us to
  compare these metrics across different countries, showing variations and trends
  in economic freedom and related factors. It would be helpful if each key metric
  has a different spline curve for clarity. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart, especially
  for differentiating the key metrics?

  2. How would you like the key metrics such as ''size_government'', ''property_rights'',
  ''sound_money'', and ''regulation'' to be labeled on the chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for the spline curves (e.g., smooth, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the key metrics and their corresponding
  spline curves?

  5. Are there specific countries or regions you would like to emphasize in the chart?

  6. How should the axis labels and titles be formatted (e.g., font size, style, orientation)?

  7. Would you prefer the data points to be highlighted or annotated with specific
  values on the spline chart?

  8. Do you have a preferred background style (e.g., gridlines, white space, colored
  background) for the chart?

  9. Should the chart include any reference lines or markers for specific thresholds
  of economic freedom or related factors?

  10. How detailed should the tooltips or hover information be when interacting with
  the different spline curves?'
