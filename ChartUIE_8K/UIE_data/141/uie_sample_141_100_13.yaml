initial_prompt: I need a table chart that compares "Economic Freedom" scores for various
  countries based on the year 2016 data. The chart should list countries in alphabetical
  order and include columns for their rankings, quartiles, and individual category
  scores such as government consumption, transfers, government enterprises, and top
  marginal tax rates. Additionally, include scores for judicial independence, impartial
  courts, protection of property rights, money growth, inflation control, and regulation
  measures. Highlight any missing values and ensure that the data is easy to read
  and interpret for a quick economic analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences on the specific layout of the table?

  2. Would you like specific colors for highlighting missing values?

  3. Is there a preferred font size or type for the table text?

  4. Should the quartiles and rankings be color-coded or use any specific visual markers?

  5. Are there specific columns that should have more emphasis or visibility?

  6. How would you like the table to handle countries with missing values in multiple
  columns?

  7. Do you have any preferences for displaying numeric values, such as number formats
  or decimal places?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or footnotes in the table?

  9. Do you prefer any particular order for the columns within the table?

  10. Should the table include any borders or separators between rows and columns
  for better readability?'
