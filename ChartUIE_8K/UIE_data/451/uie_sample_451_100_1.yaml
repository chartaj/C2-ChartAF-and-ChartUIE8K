initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the data from the Department of
  Energy & Climate Change on the Dow Jones Industrial Average over a year. Use the
  "date" on the x-axis and "Dow Jones Industrial Average" on the y-axis. Add text
  annotations for significant data points to highlight specific dates. Ensure that
  the "1 year moving average" is also plotted for comparison. Highlight the dates
