  4. How frequently should the x-axis labels display dates (e.g., every month, every
  quarter)?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the y-axis display values in a specific format (e.g., with commas, in
  thousands, with currency symbols)?

  events or values?

  (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?
