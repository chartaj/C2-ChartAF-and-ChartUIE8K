initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of the
  winning party percentages ('Winner') for each constituency. The histogram should
  show the count of constituencies on the y-axis and the percentage ranges (binned
  appropriately) on the x-axis. Make sure to include each party percentage ('CON(%)',
  'LAB(%)', 'LIB(%)', 'Brexit(%)', 'Green(%)', 'NAT(%)', 'MIN(%)', 'OTH(%)') in the
  histogram to compare how frequently each party wins with different percentage values.
  The chart should be informative and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred bin size for the percentage ranges on the x-axis?

  2. What color scheme would you like to use for different parties in the histogram?

  3. Should the histogram include labels for each bin to indicate the range of percentages?

  4. Would you prefer the histogram to include a legend specifying each party''s color?

  5. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like to use for the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  6. Should the chart include any annotations or additional information to highlight
  key insights?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or style of the chart?

  8. Would you like to display any grid lines or axis lines for better readability?'
