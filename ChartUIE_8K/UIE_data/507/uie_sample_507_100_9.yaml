initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the percentage distribution of winning
  parties (CON, LAB, LIB, etc.) across the dataset. This chart should display the
  overall share of each party's victories. Utilize the "Winner" column to count the
  occurrences of each party and calculate their percentage of the total wins. Label
  each segment with the party name and its corresponding percentage. This will help
  in understanding the dominance or competitiveness of different parties in the election
  results. Ensure the chart is clear and the segments are distinct for better interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different party
  segments?

  2. Do you prefer the percentage labels to be inside the pie chart segments or outside
  with lines pointing to them?

  3. Would you like to include a legend in the pie chart, or do you prefer relying
  solely on segment labels?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and text
  within the chart?

  5. Do you want to display the actual count of wins along with the percentage for
  each segment?

  7. Do you have preferences for the size and dimensions of the pie chart?'
