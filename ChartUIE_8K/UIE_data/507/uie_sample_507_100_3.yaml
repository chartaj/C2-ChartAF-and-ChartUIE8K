initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart illustrating the relationship between the 'Electorate'
  size and the percentage of votes for 'CON', 'LAB', and 'LIB'. The x-axis should
  represent 'Electorate', and the y-axis should show vote percentages for 'CON(%)',
  'LAB(%)', and 'LIB(%)'. Each bubble should represent an electoral area with its
  size corresponding to the total number of votes in that area. Color code the bubbles
  based on the winning party ('Winner'). Include a legend for party color coding and
  a tooltip to display detailed info for each area on hover. This will help visualize
  voting patterns across different electorates.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the party color coding in the
  chart?

  2. How would you prefer the order of parties to be displayed in the legend?

  3. Do you have a preference for the size scaling of the bubbles corresponding to
  the number of votes?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels on the data points (bubbles) on
  the chart?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or limits you would like to set for the x-axis
  (''Electorate'') or y-axis (''Vote percentages'')?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and legend?

  7. Would you like to include axis titles? If so, what titles would you prefer for
  the x-axis and y-axis?

  8. Do you have preferences for the tooltip content or format when hovering over
  each bubble?

  9. Is there a specific background color or theme you would like for the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific layout preferences, such as the position of the legend
  or title?'
