initial_prompt: I want an area chart that visualizes the electorate size for different
  areas along with the distribution of votes among different parties (CON, LAB, LIB,
  Green) across those areas. Use "Area" on the x-axis and "Electorate" on the y-axis,
  and stack the vote percentages for each party to show their share within the electorate.
  This will help to compare the party dominance and voter turnout across different
  regions. Please include legend and color coding for each party to differentiate.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each party in the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific layout for the legend (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and titles?

  4. Are there any specific regions you want to highlight or focus on?

  5. Do you have a preference for the ordering of areas on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by electorate size)?

  6. Would you like to include data markers or labels on the stacked areas for additional
  detail?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  9. Would you like to include a subtitle or any additional annotations?'
