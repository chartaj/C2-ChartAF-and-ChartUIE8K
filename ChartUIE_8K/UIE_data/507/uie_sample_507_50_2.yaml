initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the percentage votes (CON(%), LAB(%),
  LIB(%), etc.) across different constituencies. Highlight the winning party for each
  region. Annotate specific constituencies with notable differences in vote distribution.
  This will illustrate political trends and disparities.

  2. How would you prefer the winning party to be highlighted (e.g., with an outline,
  bold text, different color)?

  be based solely on notable differences in vote distribution found in the data?

  4. Do you want the percentage votes to be displayed on the heatmap cells or only
  visualized through color intensity?

  5. Would you like a legend to explain the color coding for each party''s percentage?

  6. Is there a specific layout or order for the constituencies that you prefer (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by region, by winning party)?

  7. Do you want a title and axis labels for the heatmap? If so, please provide the
  preferred text.

  visualization (e.g., average vote percentages for each party)?'
