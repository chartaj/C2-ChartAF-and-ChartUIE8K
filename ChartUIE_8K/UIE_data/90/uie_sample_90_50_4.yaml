initial_prompt: Create a Bubble chart showing the "Access to electricity (% of population)"
  on the x-axis, "Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita" on the y-axis,
  and use "Financial flows to developing countries (US $)" for the bubble size. Color
  code bubbles by "Year". Focus on years 2000-2020.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for coding the bubbles by year?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, do you have a preference for their
  style?

  4. Do you have a preferred range or specific scale (linear or logarithmic) for either
  axis?

  5. What level of detail do you want for the bubble sizes (e.g., fixed size for small
  values, proportional scaling)?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or labels on the bubbles to highlight
  key data points?

  7. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  8. Do you have a specific preference for the font style or size for the chart labels
  and legend?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I would like the x-axis labeled as "Access to electricity (% of population)"
  and the y-axis labeled as "Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita".

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Proportional scaling for bubble sizes would be fine.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
