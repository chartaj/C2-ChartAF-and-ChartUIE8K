initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the access to electricity (% of population)
  and access to clean fuels for cooking in Afghanistan from 2000 to 2020 using the
  provided data. Please ensure the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis represents
  the percentage values. Use different colored lines to distinguish between the two
  metrics. Additionally, include markers for each data point to improve readability.
  Ensure the chart has a legend, axis labels, and a title "Access to Electricity and
  Clean Fuels in Afghanistan (2000-2020)."
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the lines representing
  each metric?

  2. What specific markers would you like to see on each data point (e.g., circles,
  squares, triangles)?

  3. Where would you prefer the legend to be placed on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the title, axis labels,
  and legend?

  5. Would you like to include any grid lines or background colors on the chart?

  6. Is there any particular format you prefer for the percentage values on the y-axis
  (e.g., 0-100%, decimals, whole numbers)?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preference.

  2. I am not sure, any easily readable marker is fine.

  3. I prefer the legend to be placed at the top right.

  4. I do not know, any clear and standard font style and size is okay.

  5. I have no specific preference for grid lines or background colors.

  6. Whole numbers would be preferred for the percentage values on the y-axis.

  7. I would prefer solid lines for both metrics.

  8. I am not sure, no additional annotations are necessary.'
