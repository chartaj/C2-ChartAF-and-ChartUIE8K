initial_prompt: 'Create a heatmap using the "Global Data on Sustainable Energy (2000-2020)"
  dataset. Specifically, visualize the correlation between the following columns over
  the years: ''Access to electricity (% of population)'', ''Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita'',
  ''Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)'', ''Electricity
  from fossil fuels (TWh)'', ''Electricity from renewables (TWh)'', and ''Low-carbon
  electricity (% electricity)''. The heatmap should help identify patterns and correlations
  among these energy-related metrics across different countries and years. Make sure
  to handle missing values appropriately.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. How should we label the countries and years on the axes?

  3. Would you like to include annotations (numerical values) on the heatmap cells?

  4. How would you prefer the missing values to be handled or displayed in the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you want highlighted in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Label the countries on the y-axis and the years on the x-axis.

  3. Yes, please include annotations (numerical values) on the heatmap cells.

  4. Handle missing values by using mean imputation.

  5. I do not have a specific title or subtitle.

  6. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend explaining the color gradient.

  7. I do not know.'
