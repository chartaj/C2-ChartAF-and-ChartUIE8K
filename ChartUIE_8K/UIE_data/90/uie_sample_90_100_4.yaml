initial_prompt: I want a Bubble chart to visualize the GDP per capita, CO2 emissions,
  and Access to electricity (% of population) over various years for different countries.
  Use bubble size to represent Access to electricity, the x-axis for Year, and the
  y-axis for GDP per capita. The chart should highlight trends in sustainable energy
  and economic indicators globally from 2000 to 2020. Include data labels for countries
  to differentiate them. Also, add a color gradient to represent CO2 emissions levels
  in the bubbles. This will help understand the relationship between energy access,
  economic growth, and CO2 emissions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used to
  represent CO2 emissions levels?

  2. Would you like to see any specific countries highlighted in particular?

  3. How would you like missing data points to be handled in the visualization?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the data labels for countries?

  5. Do you have preferences regarding the chart''s title and axis labels?

  6. Would you like to include any particular markers or annotations to highlight
  significant trends or events?

  7. How detailed should the grid lines be on the chart, or do you prefer a clean
  look without them?

  8. Do you require any legends or explanatory notes within the chart to help interpret
  the color gradient and bubble sizes?'
answers: "1. I am not sure.\n2. I do not know.\n3. Handle missing data points with\
  \ interpolation or gaps as appropriate.\n4. I have no specific preference.\n5. Title:\
  \ \"Global Trends in GDP per Capita, CO2 Emissions, and Access to Electricity (2000-2020)\"\
  \n   X-axis: \"Year\"\n   Y-axis: \"GDP per Capita\"\n6. I am not sure.\n7. A clean\
  \ look without detailed grid lines.\n8. Yes, include legends or explanatory notes\
  \ to help interpret the color gradient and bubble sizes."
