initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map using the "Global Data on Sustainable
  Energy (2000-2020)" dataset. The map should visualize the "Access to electricity
  (% of population)" across different countries for the latest available year. Make
  sure each country is color-coded based on the percentage of the population with
  access to electricity. Include a color legend to indicate the varying levels of
  access. Add data labels or tooltips that show the precise percentage when hovering
  over a country. Ensure the map is user-friendly and visually engaging.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the Choropleth map?

  2. Is there a specific visual style or theme you would like the map to adhere to?

  3. Would you prefer the color legend to be a gradient or discrete color steps?

  4. Do you have preferences regarding the placement of the legend on the map?

  5. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to be highlighted or emphasized
  on the map?

  6. Is there any specific mapping projection you would like to use (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?

  7. Do you prefer the data labels to be always visible or only appear when hovering
  over a country?

  8. Would you like any additional information to be displayed in the tooltips besides
  the percentage of the population with access to electricity?

  9. Are there any accessibility considerations we should keep in mind for the visual
  design?'
