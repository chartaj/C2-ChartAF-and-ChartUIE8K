initial_prompt: Please create an area chart using the Global Data on Sustainable Energy
  (2000-2020). The primary focus should be on visualizing the "Access to electricity
  (% of population)" over the years for all countries listed. Highlight any significant
  trends or changes in data. Include the Y-axis label as "Access to electricity (%
  of population)" and the X-axis as "Year". Ensure different countries are represented
  with distinct colors for clarity. If possible, add a legend to differentiate between
  the countries. This will help in understanding the progress made in global access
  to electricity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different countries?

  2. Would you like the area chart to be stacked or unstacked?

  3. Should specific countries be highlighted more prominently in the chart?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart background?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or text labels you would like to add to emphasize
  important data points or trends?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the axis labels and
  legend?

  7. How would you like us to handle missing data points, if any, in the dataset?

  8. Should we include a title for the chart? If so, do you have a preferred title
  in mind?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or explanations
  directly on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, could you highlight any countries with significant changes more prominently?

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, the title can be "Global Access to Electricity (2000-2020)".

  9. No, just the chart itself is fine.'
