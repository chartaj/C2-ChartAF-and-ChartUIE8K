initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot highlighting renewable energy share vs. CO2
  emissions. Annotate significant outliers in CO2 emissions using text annotations.
  This will help visualize the relationship between renewable energy usage and emissions
  across countries from 2000-2020.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme of the scatter
  plot?

  2. How would you like the axes to be labeled (e.g., "Renewable Energy Share (%)",
  "CO2 Emissions (kt)")?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the text annotations on the outliers (e.g.,
  font size, color, background)?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you have a preference for the size of the scatter plot markers?

  6. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color different from
  the other data points?

  7. Do you want to include a legend explaining the data points and outliers?

  8. Are there any specific countries or years you would like to highlight in addition
  to the outliers?

  9. Would you like to display any trend lines or fit lines on the scatter plot to
  help visualize the relationship between renewable energy usage and CO2 emissions?'
