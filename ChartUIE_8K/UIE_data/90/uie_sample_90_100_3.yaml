initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the "Access to electricity
  (% of population)" over the years for Afghanistan from 2000 to 2002. This will help
  us understand the trend in electrification over time. Additionally, show "Access
  to clean fuels for cooking" alongside it for a comparative view. Use different colors
  for each variable and ensure that the years are labeled clearly on the x-axis, with
  the percentage access on the y-axis. Title the chart "Energy Access in Afghanistan
  (2000-2002)".
questions: '1. Are there any specific colors you prefer for representing "Access to
  electricity (% of population)" and "Access to clean fuels for cooking"?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the chart title, axis
  labels, and data labels?

  3. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked in the bar chart?

  4. Should the y-axis start at 0, or is there a specific range you would like to
  be displayed?

  5. Do you prefer any particular style or format for displaying the percentages on
  the y-axis (e.g., with percentage signs, decimal places)?

  6. Is there a specific legend placement you prefer (e.g., top, right, bottom)?

  7. Would you like any gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, should
  they be major, minor, or both?

  8. Do you prefer any specific background color or theme for the chart?'
