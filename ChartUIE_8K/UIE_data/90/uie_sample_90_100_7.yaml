initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the changes in access to electricity and financial
  flows over the years for different countries. Please create a box chart showing
  "Access to electricity (% of population)" and "Financial flows to developing countries
  (US $)" from 2000 to 2020. Ensure each country is represented on the x-axis while
  the y-axis shows both metrics side by side as boxes. This should help in comparing
  the distribution and trends of these metrics across different countries over the
  two decades.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the chart?

  2. Would you like to highlight any specific countries in the visualization?

  3. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you want any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  5. Is there a need for a legend to differentiate between ''Access to electricity''
  and ''Financial flows''?

  6. Should outliers be displayed or excluded in the box plots?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used in the chart?

  8. Would you like to include reference lines or markers for specific years or data
  points?

  9. Should the chart include annotations or tooltips for additional data insights?

  10. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  angled)?'
