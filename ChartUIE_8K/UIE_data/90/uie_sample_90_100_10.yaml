initial_prompt: I need a Donut chart visualizing the "Global Data on Sustainable Energy
  (2000-2020)" showing the proportion of different sources of electricity generation
  for the year 2000 across various countries. Specifically, compare "Electricity from
  fossil fuels (TWh)," "Electricity from nuclear (TWh)," and "Electricity from renewables
  (TWh)." Each segment should represent the total electricity generated from those
  sources for all countries combined. Make sure to include a legend indicating what
  each segment represents.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the segments representing
  fossil fuels, nuclear, and renewables?

  2. Should the chart title include any specific information beyond a general description,
  such as units (TWh) or the year (2000)?

  3. Would you like to display the percentage values inside the segments of the Donut
  chart?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  5. Is there a particular layout you prefer for the legend (e.g., positioned at the
  bottom, right side, or integrated into the chart)?

  6. Should the Donut chart include any annotations or callouts for significant data
  points?

  7. Are there any branding guidelines (e.g., logo, colors) that need to be adhered
  to for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include the units (TWh) and the year (2000) in the chart title.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I prefer the legend to be positioned at the bottom.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
