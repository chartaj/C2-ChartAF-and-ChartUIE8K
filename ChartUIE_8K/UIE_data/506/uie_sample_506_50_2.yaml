initial_prompt: Create a pie chart showing the distribution of champions based on
  their win rates. Use annotations to highlight the top three champions with the highest

  perform better relative to others.

  4. Do you want the legend to list all champions or just the top three?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the text in the chart?

  6. Would you like to see any specific patterns or textures in the pie chart segments
  for better differentiation?

  7. Should the chart include a title? If yes, do you have a preferred title?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to include detailed tooltips on hover for each segment?'
