initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to champions in a game, including columns
  like Games, Win, Loss, Winrate, Bans, and Picks and Bans. I need a comprehensive
  table chart that displays the performance metrics of each champion. It should highlight
  the number of games played, wins, losses, win rate, games on the blue side, games
  on the red side, and the percentage of bans and picks. Please ensure each column
  of data is clearly labeled and include the percentage values where applicable to
  give a better understanding of each champion's performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred order for the columns in the table?

  2. Should the Winrate, Winrate(B), and Winrate(R) percentages be visually highlighted
  or formatted in a specific way (e.g., colored text, bold)?

  3. Would you like to include any additional columns or metrics besides those mentioned?

  4. Is there a preferred alignment for the data within the table (left, center, right)?

  5. Should the table include any special formatting for easier readability, such
  as alternating row colors or borders?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the table text?

  7. Is there a need for sorting functionality in the table, for example, sorting
  by Winrate or Bans(%)?

  8. Do you want to include any summary statistics or footnotes at the bottom of the
  table?

  9. Should the table be displayed in landscape or portrait orientation?

  10. Would you like to include any additional context or annotations to explain certain
  columns or figures in the table?'
