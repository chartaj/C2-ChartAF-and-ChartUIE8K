initial_prompt: 'Visualize champion performance with a line chart: X-axis for ''Champion,''
  Y-axis for ''Winrate,'' showing ''Winrate,'' ''Winrate(B),'' and ''Winrate(R).''
  Highlight champions with overall high win rates. Annotate specific data points to
  emphasize champions with significant differences between ''Winrate,'' ''Winrate(B),''
  and ''Winrate(R).'' Purpose: understanding variation in performance across different
  scenarios. Practical for identifying strong champions and their consistency. Ensure
  clear legends and color differentiation for each win rate line, making it easy to
  compare across champions.'
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the win rate lines? \n2.\
  \ Would you like to customize the style of the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)\
  \ to differentiate between 'Winrate,' 'Winrate(B),' and 'Winrate(R)'?\n3. Do you\
  \ have any preferences for the type of markers used for specific data points (e.g.,\
  \ circles, squares, triangles)?\n4. Is there a particular font style or size you\
  \ prefer for annotations and labels?\n5. Would you like to add a specific title\
  \ and subtitles to the chart? If so, what should they be?\n6. Do you prefer the\
  \ champions to be sorted in a particular order on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetically,\
  \ by overall win rate)?\n7. Would you like a grid to be included in the chart for\
  \ better readability? If so, should it be a major grid, minor grid, or both?\n8.\
  \ Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines representing the win\
  \ rates?\n9. Would you like to include tooltips for additional data points on hover,\
  \ such as number of games played?\n10. Do you have any specific requirements for\
  \ the legend placement on the chart?"
