initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart to visualize the winrate trends of different
  champions over the number of games played. The x-axis should represent the number
  of games, and the y-axis should reflect the winrate percentages for each champion.
  Show a separate spline for each champion to compare their performance. Highlight
  significant peaks and troughs in winrate to identify critical points. Include a
  legend for clarity and ensure the chart is easily interpretable. Also, incorporate
  data labels for key points to emphasize important changes in winrate.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different splines representing
  each champion?

  2. How would you like significant peaks and troughs in winrate to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific markers, different colors)?

  3. Do you prefer the data labels for key points to be positioned in a specific way?

  4. Is there a specific style or font you prefer for the legend and data labels?

  5. Do you have any preference for the background color or gridlines of the chart?

  6. Would you like the x-axis and y-axis to have specific increments or ranges?

  7. Are there any other specific annotations or highlights you would like to add
  to the chart?'
