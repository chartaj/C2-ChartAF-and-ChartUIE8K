initial_prompt: I need a column chart to visualize the win rates of different champions
  in both Blue and Red side games. Each champion should be represented as a separate
  column. The X-axis should display the champion names, and the Y-axis should show
  the win rate percentages. Additionally, please use different colors to differentiate
  between Blue and Red side win rates on the same chart. This will help me easily
  compare the performance of champions on each side. Ensure the chart includes labels
  and a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to differentiate between
  Blue and Red side win rates?

  2. Would you prefer the columns for each champion to be grouped side by side or
  stacked on top of each other?

  3. Do you want the Y-axis to display win rate percentages as integers or decimals?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and legend?

  5. Are there any specific champions that should be highlighted or emphasized?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which champions are displayed on the
  X-axis (e.g., alphabetically, by win rate)?

  7. Would you like any additional information or annotations on each column (e.g.,
  exact win rate percentage)?'
