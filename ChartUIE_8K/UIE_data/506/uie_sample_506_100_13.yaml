initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize this data. The chart should
  show each Champion and compare their 'Win' and 'Loss' counts side by side for both
  'Games(B)' (Blue side) and 'Games(R)' (Red side). Use different colored segments
  for 'Win(B)', 'Loss(B)', 'Win(R)', and 'Loss(R)'. This will help in analyzing the
  performance of each champion across different game sides. Label each segment and
  include the Winrate percentage on top of each column for clarity. The x-axis should
  list the Champions, and the y-axis should represent the number of Games.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the segments representing
  ''Win(B)'', ''Loss(B)'', ''Win(R)'', and ''Loss(R)''?

  2. What should be the font size and style for the labels of each segment?

  3. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If so, where should it be positioned?

  4. How should the Winrate percentage labels on top of each column be formatted (e.g.,
  font size, color, format)?

  5. Should the y-axis have a specific range or scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Do you want gridlines included on the chart? If so, should they be shown for
  both x and y axes?

  7. Are there any specific margins or padding preferences for the chart layout?

  8. Should there be any additional annotations or text boxes to highlight specific
  data points or trends?

  9. Would you like to include any tooltips or data labels for additional information
  upon hovering over the chart?

  10. Should there be any specific title or subtitle added to the chart for better
  context? If so, what should they be?'

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I would like a legend included, and it should be positioned at the bottom.

  9. No, I am looking for an image, not interactive data visualization.

  10. Yes, please include the title "Champion Performance Across Game Sides" and the
  subtitle "Comparison of Wins and Losses for Each Champion on Blue and Red Sides".'
