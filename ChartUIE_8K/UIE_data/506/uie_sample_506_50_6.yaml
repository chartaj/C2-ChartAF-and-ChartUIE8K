initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the win rates of champions. Use the
  'Winrate' column for each champion to compare the distribution of win rates. This
  should give insights on the variability and central tendency of each champion's
  performance in terms of win rates.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the box chart?

  3. Should the chart include a title and subtitles for better context? If so, what
  should they be?

  4. Do you prefer the axis labels to be horizontal or vertical?

  5. Would you like to see grid lines on the chart for easier comparison?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, especially if multiple data series or categories
  are involved?

  7. Do you have a specific order in which the champions should be displayed (alphabetical,
  by win rate, etc.)?

  8. Do you prefer any additional statistical information to be displayed, such as
  mean or standard deviation?

  9. Should the outliers be highlighted or marked distinctly in the box chart?

  10. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the text elements
  in the chart?'
