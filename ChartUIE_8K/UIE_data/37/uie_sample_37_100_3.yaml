initial_prompt: Please create a box plot to visualize the distribution of ages, annual
  incomes, and spending scores in the mall customer segmentation data. Please use
  different colors for each category on the same chart, so we can easily compare the
  distributions. Make sure to include clear labels and a legend to differentiate between
  the age, income, and spending score distributions. This will help us understand
  the customer demographics and spending behavior better. Additionally, ensure that
  the gender information is not included in this box plot as we want to focus on numeric
  distributions only.

  (age, annual income, spending score)?

  each box plot (e.g., outliers marked with dots)?

  6. Would you like to include any custom tooltips or annotations on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific axis scales or ranges that you prefer for the chart?
