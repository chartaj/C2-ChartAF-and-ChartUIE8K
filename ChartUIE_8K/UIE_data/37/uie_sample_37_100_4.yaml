initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the spending behavior of customers in
  the mall dataset. The x-axis should represent Age groups, while the y-axis should
  represent Annual Income groups (in $k). The color intensity will represent the average
  Spending Score within each segment. This visualization will help understand which
  age and income groups have the highest and lowest spending scores, making it easier
  to target marketing strategies effectively. Use different color gradients to make
  the differences in spending scores visible and ensure the labels are clear for easy
  interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. What specific age group intervals would you like to use on the x-axis?

  3. What specific income group intervals would you like to use on the y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be included in the heatmap?

  6. Do you want to include a legend explaining the color intensity levels?

  7. Should there be any annotations inside the heatmap cells to show exact spending
  scores?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color gradient, maybe something that clearly
  shows differences.

  2. Age group intervals could be in increments of 10 years.

  3. Income group intervals could be in increments of $10k.

  4. I do not know, no specific preference for font style or size.

  5. I am not sure about grid lines, you can decide what works best.

  6. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color intensity levels.

  7. I am not sure about annotations inside the heatmap cells, you can decide if it
  enhances the visualization.'
