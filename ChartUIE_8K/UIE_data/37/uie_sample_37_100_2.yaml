initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of annual income
  and spending scores among customers. Use gender to differentiate the distributions.
  Annotate significant outliers and extreme values to highlight unusual spending behavior.
  Additionally, use color highlights to distinguish between male and female customers
  in the plot for better visual separation. This will help in understanding the variance
  and skewness of customer spending habits and income distribution, aiding in segmenting
  the customer base for targeted marketing strategies. Add textual annotations to
  provide insights on the gender differences in spending patterns.
