initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the trend of Carbon Dioxide emissions
  over the years using the 'Decimal_Date' for the x-axis and 'Average' for the y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  detailed)?

  10. Should the chart include a trend line or any additional lines (e.g., moving
  average)?'
