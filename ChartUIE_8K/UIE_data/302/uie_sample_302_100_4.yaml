initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing carbon dioxide emission rates from 1958.
  Could you please create a line chart that shows the trend over time? I want to visualize
  how the average, interpolated, and trend values have evolved year by year. Make
  sure the x-axis represents the decimal dates and the y-axis shows the CO2 levels.
  Please also differentiate the lines for average, interpolated, and trend values
  using different colors. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''Average'', ''Interpolated'', and ''Trend'' values?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  4. Would you like to add axis titles for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, do you have
  preferred labels?

  5. Is there a specific range you want to set for the y-axis to focus on a particular
  range of CO2 levels?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart''s text elements
  (titles, labels, legend)?

  7. Would you like to include markers on the lines to indicate data points?

  8. Do you want the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or data highlights you would like to include
  on the chart?

  10. Would you like to display the values of specific points on the lines, such as
  the first or last data points?'
