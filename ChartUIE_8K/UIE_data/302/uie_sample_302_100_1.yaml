initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the Carbon Dioxide Emission Rates
  using the provided environmental-science data. Plot 'Decimal_Date' on the x-axis
  and 'Average' on the y-axis. Annotate critical data points to highlight significant
  trends and ensure clarity. Additionally, vary marker sizes and colors to emphasize
  disparities and trends over the years. Add descriptive text annotations to clarify
  peaks and notable changes, using non-data-driven annotations for context. Highlight
  trends using different colors for comparative analysis of 'Average' versus 'Trend'
  values across time. Ensure the visualization focuses on key emissions data while
  offering context through annotations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color palette used in the
  scatter plot?

  2. Is there a particular format or style you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Do you have a preferred size or style for the markers on the scatter plot?

  4. What level of detail should the text annotations include?

  5. Are there specific trends or data points that you want to ensure are highlighted?

  6. Is there a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the chart?

  7. Do you want the x-axis and y-axis to have specific scaling (e.g., logarithmic)
  or labeling format?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, how would you like it to be styled?

  9. Would you like gridlines in the background of the scatter plot? If yes, any preference
  on their style?

  10. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the chart''s labels and
  annotations?'
