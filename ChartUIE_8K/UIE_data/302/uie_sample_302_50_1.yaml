initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot illustrating the trend of Average CO2 levels
  over the years. Highlight significant trend points and annotate key variations to
  emphasize changes in emission rates.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used in the scatter
  plot?

  2. Are there specific years or ranges of years you want explicitly highlighted?

  3. Do you prefer any specific symbols or shapes for significant trend points?

  4. How would you like the key variations annotated (e.g., textual notes, arrows)?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for annotations?

  6. Do you want grid lines in the background for better readability of the plot?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the axes?

  8. Would you prefer a logarithmic scale or a linear scale for the y-axis?

  9. Should the significant trend points be labeled with their exact CO2 values?

  10. Would you like to include a legend explaining the annotations and highlighted
  points?

  11. How much rounding off do you prefer for the numerical values displayed in the
  annotations?

  12. Do you prefer the scatter plot to include markers with connecting lines to display
  the trend, or only markers?'
