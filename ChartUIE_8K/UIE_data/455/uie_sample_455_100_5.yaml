initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the data provided. Plot 'gdpPercap'
  on the x-axis and 'lifeExp' on the y-axis. Color code the points based on the 'continent'
  and ensure each country is represented. Use the 'iso_alpha' codes to label the points
  on the scatter plot to identify the countries. This visualization should help us
  understand the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across different
  continents in the year 2007. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the continents in the scatter
  plot?

  2. Would you like the labels (''iso_alpha'' codes) for each country to be displayed
  at a particular angle or font size?

  3. Should there be any specific markers or shapes for different continents?

  4. Would you prefer any particular style for the gridlines (solid, dashed, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences on the axis scales (linear or logarithmic)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed (top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Are there any particular titles or subtitles you would like for the chart or
  the axes?

  8. Do you want to include data point annotations other than ''iso_alpha''?

  9. Should there be any specific margins or padding around the plot area?

  10. Do you have preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend. I have no specific preference for its placement.

  7. Title: "GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy (2007)". X-axis: "GDP per Capita".
  Y-axis: "Life Expectancy".

  8. No, just the ''iso_alpha'' codes is fine.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
