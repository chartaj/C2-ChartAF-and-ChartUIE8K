initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart using the provided dataset to visualize
  the distribution of countries across different continents in 2007. The chart should
  show the percentage of countries that belong to each continent (Africa, Asia, Europe,
  etc.) based on the 'continent' column. Make sure to label each section with the
  continent name and its corresponding percentage. This visualization will help in
  understanding the geographical distribution of countries in the given year. Include
  a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the pie chart?

  2. How would you like the labels to be displayed (inside the slices, outside with
  lines, etc.)?

  3. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for the labels?

  4. Would you like to include any additional information on the chart other than
  the continent names and their percentages?

  5. Is there a specific order in which the continents should be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by percentage)?

  6. Do you have a title preference for the pie chart?

  7. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart
  (top, bottom, side)?

  8. Are there any specific stylistic preferences for the legend, such as font size,
  color, or border?

  9. Do you prefer a specific type of pie chart (e.g., 2D, 3D, exploded segments)?

  10. Would you like any specific format for the percentages (e.g., decimal places,
  percentage sign)?'
