initial_prompt: Visualize the life expectancy data through a Box Chart for different
  continents in 2007. Highlight key outliers and use text annotations to spotlight
  the highest and lowest life expectancies for each continent. The chart will help
  in comparing the distribution and variance of life expectancy among continents.
  Make sure to emphasize the median and quartiles within each box plot. Additionally,
  provide context on why there's variation among continentsâ€”potentially attributing
  it to differences in healthcare, economic standards, or sociopolitical factors.
  This will aid social science research by offering a clear visual comparison of global
  life expectancies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Are there specific fonts or text styles you would like for the annotations?

  3. Do you want the outliers to be marked with specific symbols or colors?

  4. How would you like the median and quartiles to be emphasized (e.g., different
  line styles or colors)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific layout or positioning for the text annotations highlighting
  the highest and lowest life expectancies?

  6. Should the chart include additional grid lines or background elements for better
  readability?

  7. How detailed would you like the legends and labels to be for the different continents?

  8. Do you want any specific context or commentary incorporated within the chart
  area regarding the variations among continents?

  9. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the box chart?

  10. Should the chart include any border or shading effects to distinguish between
  the different continents?'
