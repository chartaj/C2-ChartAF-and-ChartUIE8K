initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing life expectancy across different countries
  in 2007. Highlight the countries with the highest and lowest life expectancy to
  draw attention to disparities. Include text annotations displaying the life expectancy
  values for these highlighted countries. Ensure each bar represents a country and
  is colored according to its continent for additional context. The chart aims to
  show the variation in life expectancy around the world and encourage a closer look
  at what might be influencing these differences. This will be useful for social science
  research and policy analysis.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the continents?

  2. What should be the default sort order of the countries (e.g., ascending or descending
  by life expectancy)?

  3. How would you like the highlighted countries (with the highest and lowest life
  expectancy) to be visually distinguished (e.g., different color, additional markers)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the text annotations
  displaying life expectancy values?

  5. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you have preferences for the axis labels or any specific styling for them?

  8. Should the life expectancy values be displayed on the bars themselves or at the
  top of the bars?

  9. Are there any specific countries or continents you would like to highlight or
  provide extra focus on?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Ascending by life expectancy.

  3. Different color for the highest and lowest life expectancy countries.

  4. I do not know.

  5. The title should be "Life Expectancy Across Different Countries in 2007"; no
  specific preference for the subtitle.

  6. Yes, include gridlines for better readability.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Display the life expectancy values at the top of the bars.

  9. I am not sure.'
