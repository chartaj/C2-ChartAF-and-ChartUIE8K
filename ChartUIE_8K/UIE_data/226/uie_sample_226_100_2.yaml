initial_prompt: Visualize the temperature changes by country from 1961 to 2022 with
  a line chart. Highlight the data points for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 to emphasize
  significant changes. Annotate the temperature values for these highlighted years
  to draw attention. This will help us understand long-term trends and noticeable
  shifts in climate patterns over decades. Use different colors for each country to
  differentiate them easily. Ensure the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis
  depicts temperature changes in degrees Celsius. The chart aims to showcase climate
  change trends across different countries over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the countries or should
  we use a predefined color palette?

  2. What style of line would you prefer for the chart (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  3. How do you want the highlighted data points for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020
  to be marked (e.g., with a different color, larger size, or specific shape)?

  4. Where would you prefer the temperature annotations to be placed relative to the
  highlighted data points?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the annotations and
  labels on the chart?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included, and if so, do you have any preferences
  for its placement on the chart?

  7. Are there any specific titles, subtitles, or footnotes you would like to include
  in the chart?

  8. How would you like the axes (x-axis for years, y-axis for temperature changes)
  to be labeled and formatted?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines'' appearance on the chart (e.g.,
  visibility, line style, or color)?

  10. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as references
  to events or baseline climatology, on the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color preference, a predefined color palette
  is fine.

  2. I am not sure about the line style.

  3. Mark the highlighted data points with a different color and larger size.

  4. Place the temperature annotations just above the highlighted data points.

  5. I do not have a preference for font style or size.

  6. Yes, include a legend. I am not sure about the placement.

  7. No specific titles, subtitles, or footnotes.

  8. Label the x-axis as "Years" and the y-axis as "Temperature Changes (Â°C)".

  9. I do not know about the gridlines'' appearance.

  10. I am not sure about additional contextual information.'
