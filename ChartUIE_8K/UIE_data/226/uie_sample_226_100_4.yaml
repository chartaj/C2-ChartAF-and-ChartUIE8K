initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the temperature change from 1961
  to 2022 for the countries in the dataset. The x-axis should represent the years
  from 1961 to 2022, and the y-axis should show the temperature change in degrees
  Celsius. Each country should have its own colored area to differentiate between
  them. Use the 'Country' column for the different countries and the 'F1961' to 'F2022'
  columns for the yearly temperature change data. This will help us see the trends
  in temperature changes over the years for different countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to be used
  to differentiate between countries?

  2. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If so, what should the title be?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include descriptions such as ''Years'' for
  the x-axis and ''Temperature Change (Â°C)'' for the y-axis?

  4. Do you prefer to display a legend for the countries on a specific part of the
  chart, such as the top, bottom, left, or right?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart? If so, should
  they be for both the x-axis and y-axis or for one of them?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and title
  on the chart?

  7. Should any specific countries be highlighted or emphasized in the chart? If so,
  which ones?

  8. Would you like to add data labels showing temperature change values directly
  on the chart for each year?

  9. Do you prefer a certain level of opacity for the colored areas to ensure visibility
  of overlapping areas between different countries?

  10. Are there any other specific annotations or markers you would like to include
  in the chart to highlight particular years or events?'
