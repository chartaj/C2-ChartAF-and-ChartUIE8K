initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the annual temperature change from 1961
  to 2022 for each country. Use 'Country' for the rows and years (F1961, F1962, ...,
  F2022) for the columns. Each cell should represent the temperature change in that
  year. Highlight cells with higher temperature changes in warmer colors. Title the
  chart "Annual Temperature Changes by Country (1961-2022)" and include a color legend
  to represent the temperature change values. Ensure the chart is easy to read and
  the data source is mentioned.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like any specific annotations on the heatmap (e.g., country names,
  specific temperature values)?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout for the color legend (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Would you like grid lines between each cell to be more prominent or subtle?

  5. Do you have a preference for the text size of the axis labels and legend?

  6. Should the heatmap include labels for each cell showing temperature change values?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to be used for the title
  and labels?

  8. Would you like the chart to include any additional information such as average
  temperature changes or trends over time for each country?'
