initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the GDP and Unemployment Rate for
  countries. Each bar will represent a country, with two sections in different colors
  - one for GDP and another for the Unemployment Rate. Add data-driven text annotations
  to highlight the exact GDP and Unemployment Rate values for the United States, China,
  and Japan. Use highlights to make these three countries stand out visually compared
  to the others, perhaps by using brighter colors or larger bar sizes. This will help
  focus attention on the key economic indicators of these major economies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the GDP and Unemployment Rate
  sections of each bar?

  2. How would you like the data-driven text annotations to be styled (e.g., font
  size, color, placement)?

  3. What type of highlight effects would you prefer to distinguish the United States,
  China, and Japan (e.g., brighter colors, larger bar sizes, bold borders)?

  4. Should there be a legend to explain the color coding of the GDP and Unemployment
  Rate sections?

  5. Would you like any gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal bars)?

  7. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted (e.g., specific font, size,
  color)?

  8. Would you like to include any additional annotations or labels for other important
  data points or countries?'
