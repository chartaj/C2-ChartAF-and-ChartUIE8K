initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of sales
  channels within the comprehensive supply chain analysis dataset. I want to see the
  proportion of orders coming from In-Store, Online, and Distributor channels. The
  chart should clearly label each segment with the sales channel name and the corresponding
  percentage. This will help us understand which sales channels are most frequently
  used in our supply chain. Please ensure the chart is easy to read and visually appealing.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for each sales
  channel segment?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend, or is labeling each segment sufficient?

  3. Do you prefer the percentage labels to be placed inside the pie segments or outside?

  4. Should the chart include both percentage and actual number of orders, or just
  the percentage?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels and
  title?

  6. Do you have a particular title you want for the pie chart?

  7. Is there a specific order you would like the segments arranged in (e.g., from
  largest to smallest, alphabetical)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Labeling each segment is sufficient.

  3. Inside the pie segments.
