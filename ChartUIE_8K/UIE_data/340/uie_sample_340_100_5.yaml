initial_prompt: I need a heatmap for our Comprehensive Supply Chain Analysis project.
  The heatmap should visualize the correlation between different columns in our supply
  chain data, such as Order Quantity, Discount Applied, Unit Cost, and Unit Price.
  Additionally, include _SalesTeamID, _CustomerID, _StoreID, and _ProductID for relational
  insights. Focus on showing how these factors influence each other, identify any
  trends or anomalies, and help in optimizing the supply chain processes. Use the
  provided sample data to guide the design and ensure clarity for team presentations.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Should the correlation coefficients be displayed on the heatmap cells?

  3. Do you want a specific range for the correlation values to be highlighted (e.g.,
  strong correlations in a different color)?

  4. Would you like the heatmap to include a hierarchical clustering to show more
  relational insights?

  5. Is there a specific order you prefer for the columns in the heatmap?

  6. Do you have preferences for the size and resolution of the heatmap for team presentations?

  7. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or labels for better clarity?

  8. Do you prefer a specific style for the grid lines in the heatmap?'
