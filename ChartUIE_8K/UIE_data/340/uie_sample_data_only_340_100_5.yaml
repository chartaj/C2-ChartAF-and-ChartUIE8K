02_initial_prompt: I need a heatmap for our Comprehensive Supply Chain Analysis project.
  The heatmap should visualize the correlation between different columns in our supply
  chain data, such as Order Quantity, Discount Applied, Unit Cost, and Unit Price.
  Additionally, include _SalesTeamID, _CustomerID, _StoreID, and _ProductID for relational
  insights. Focus on showing how these factors influence each other, identify any
  trends or anomalies, and help in optimizing the supply chain processes. Use the
  provided sample data to guide the design and ensure clarity for team presentations.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
