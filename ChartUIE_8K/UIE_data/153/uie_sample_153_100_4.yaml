initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualization using the Energy Efficiency
  Dataset. The heatmap should depict the relationships between the variables X1 through
  X8 and the output variables Y1 and Y2. Also, ensure that you highlight any significant
  correlations between the input features (X1-X8) and the output variables (Y1, Y2).
  The color intensity should clearly indicate the strength of the correlations, making
  it easy to identify patterns or strong relationships within the dataset. This will
  provide better insights into how the different variables contribute to energy efficiency.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity scale be linear or logarithmic?

  3. Do you want to include annotations displaying the correlation values on the heatmap?

  4. What resolution or bin size (if applicable) do you prefer for the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preferred color for highlighting significant correlations?

  6. Are there any specific visual or design guidelines that we should follow (e.g.,
  font size, legend position)?

  7. Should the heatmap include grid lines separating the cells?'
