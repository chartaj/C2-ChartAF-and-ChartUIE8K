initial_prompt: Please visualize the relationship between 'X1', 'X2', and 'Y1', 'Y2'
  from the data provided in Data/153.csv using a line chart. Plot 'X1' on the x-axis
  with corresponding 'Y1' values on the y-axis in one line, and another line should
  represent 'X2' with corresponding 'Y2' on the y-axis. Highlight major trends and
  any patterns. This will help in understanding how 'X1' and 'X2' impact energy efficiency
  outcomes 'Y1' and 'Y2'. Thanks!
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the lines representing ''X1-Y1''
  and ''X2-Y2''?

  2. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines?

  4. Do you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for distinguishing
  the two lines?

  5. Should there be a legend to differentiate between the ''X1-Y1'' and ''X2-Y2''
  lines?

  6. How would you like the axes to be labeled (font size, style, color)?

  7. Would you like trend lines or smoothing lines to be added for better visualization
  of patterns?

  8. Do you have any preference for the overall chart title and axis titles?

  9. Would you like to annotate major trends or patterns directly on the chart?

  10. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it be automatically adjusted
  based on the data?'
