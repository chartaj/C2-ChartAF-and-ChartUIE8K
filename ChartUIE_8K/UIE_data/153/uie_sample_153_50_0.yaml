initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot showing energy efficiency relationships
  between X1 and Y1, and X2 and Y2. Highlight significant data points for emphasis
  and add text annotations to illustrate specific values. This will help in visual
  analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting significant
  data points?

  2. What type of markers would you prefer for the scatter plot points (e.g., circles,
  squares, triangles)?

  3. Do you want to use different marker styles or colors for X1 vs. Y1 and X2 vs.
  Y2?

  4. How should the significant data points be identified (specific conditions, top/bottom
  values, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the placement of text annotations?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text annotations?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the axis scales (linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Should there be grid lines on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  9. Do you require a legend to differentiate between the datasets or highlighted
  points?

  10. Are there any specific titles or labels you want for the axes and chart?'
