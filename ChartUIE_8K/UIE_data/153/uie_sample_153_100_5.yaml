initial_prompt: Please create a box plot visualization for the 'Energy Efficiency
  Dataset'. I would like to see how the distribution of both 'Y1' and 'Y2' values
  varies based on the different categorical values in 'X6'. This should help identify
  any potential outliers and understand the spread of energy efficiency data. Ensure
  that each category in 'X6' (which has unique values of 2, 3, and 4) is clearly represented.
  Highlight any significant differences in the quartiles and medians.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different categories of ''X6''?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the background of the chart?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the chart (vertical or horizontal
  box plots)?

  4. Should we include labels for the quartiles and medians on the box plots?

  5. Do you want to add a title to the chart? If so, what should it be?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between ''Y1'' and ''Y2''?

  7. Should we add specific annotations for any outliers found in the data?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the style or size of the font used in the chart?

  9. Would you like to display the count of data points for each category within the
  chart?

  10. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and their formatting?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am open to either orientation.

  4. Yes, please include labels for the quartiles and medians.

  5. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Energy Efficiency (Y1 and Y2) by X6
  Categories."

  6. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between ''Y1'' and ''Y2''.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have any specific preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I do not have any specific requirements for the axis labels and their formatting.'
