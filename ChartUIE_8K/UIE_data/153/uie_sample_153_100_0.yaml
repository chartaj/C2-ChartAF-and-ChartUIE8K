initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the features
  X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8 with Y1 and Y2 from the energy efficiency dataset.
  Use text annotations to highlight specific notable data points in the scatter plot
  (e.g., outliers, clusters). Employ highlights to distinguish relevant data points,
  such as those with unique characteristics or extreme values, by altering their colors
  or sizes. The visualization aims to aid in understanding how various X features
  influence Y1 and Y2, focusing on energy metrics. Present the data to offer clear
  insights into energy efficiency patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the scatter
  plot?

  2. Do you want to assign specific colors for any X features or values?

  3. How would you like to visually differentiate notable data points (e.g., shapes
  or sizes)?

  4. Do you prefer a particular placement for text annotations (e.g., left, right,
  above, below)?

  5. Should the axes be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  6. Are specific axis labels or titles preferred?

  7. Do you want gridlines or background patterns on the chart?

  8. Do you require any specific legend or key to be included in the chart?

  9. Should there be any specific formatting for highlighting clusters (e.g., color
  intensity, contours)?

  10. Do you have preferences for the font style and size for annotations and axis
  labels?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Differentiating notable data points by size would be good.

  4. I prefer text annotations to be placed beside the notable points.

  5. Linear scale is preferred for the axes.

  6. No specific preference for axis labels or titles.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.

  9. I do not know.
