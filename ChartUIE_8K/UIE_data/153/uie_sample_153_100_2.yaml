initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize energy efficiency dataset. Highlight
  the unique values of X6 and X8, focusing on their relationships with Y1 and Y2.
  Annotate specific data points that stand out in the dataset to draw attention to
  key insights. The purpose of this visualization is to identify patterns and outliers
  in energy efficiency. This will help in understanding how different factors contribute
  to energy consumption and efficiency. The chart should make it easy to compare these
  columns and interpret the findings visually. Include text annotations to clarify
  the values of significant data points.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or themes for the chart?

  2. Would you like to display gridlines in the chart? If so, should they be more
  prominent for specific axes?

  3. How would you like the bars to be grouped or categorized, especially for unique
  values of X6 and X8?

  4. Are there any specific data points you already know of that you would like to
  be annotated?

  5. What level of detail should the text annotations include? For example, just the
  values or additional context?

  6. How should outliers be marked or differentiated from the rest of the data points?

  7. Would you prefer a specific layout or ordering of the bars (e.g., descending
  or ascending by value)?

  8. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the annotations and
  axis labels?

  9. How would you like the legend to be displayed, especially in relation to the
  unique values of X6 and X8?

  10. What title or subtitle should the chart have to best convey its purpose to the
  intended audience?'
answers: "1. I do not have any specific preference.\n2. I am not sure.\n3. I am not\
  \ sure, maybe grouped by unique values of X6 first, then X8 within each X6 group.\n\
  4. I don't know specific data points now.\n5. The text annotations should include\
  \ values and additional context if it's significant.\n6. I am not sure.\n7. I do\
  \ not have any specific preference.\n8. I do not know. \n9. I am not sure.\n10.\
  \ The title should be something like \"Analysis of Energy Efficiency Patterns and\
  \ Outliers.\""
