initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Y1' and 'Y2'
  from the Energy Efficiency Dataset. Highlight significant ranges in the data to
  emphasize differences in energy efficiency measurements. Use text annotations to
  mark key data points and provide context for the displayed values. The purpose is
  to allow for an easy comparison of energy efficiency values and to focus viewers
  on notable trends or anomalies within the data. This visualization aims to aid in
  understanding the energy efficiency variations, helping in decision-making processes
  related to energy management and optimization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram bars and highlighted
  ranges?

  2. How many bins would you like to use for the histogram?

  3. Do you have specific ranges or thresholds in mind that you want to highlight
  within the data?

  4. Where would you like the text annotations to appear in relation to the key data
  points?

  5. Is there a preferred font size or style for the text annotations?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the title and axis labels of the histogram?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to explain the significance of the highlighted
  ranges?

  8. Is there a specific layout or format you prefer for displaying multiple histograms
  (e.g., side-by-side or stacked)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please highlight the ranges with the highest frequency and any outliers.

  4. Near the key data points so they are easily readable.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Include descriptive labels such as "Energy Efficiency (Y1)" and "Energy Efficiency
  (Y2)", with a clear title like "Distribution of Energy Efficiency Measurements (Y1
  and Y2)".

  7. Yes, including a legend would be helpful.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
