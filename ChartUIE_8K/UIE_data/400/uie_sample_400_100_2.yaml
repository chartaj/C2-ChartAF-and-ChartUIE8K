initial_prompt: Display a box chart visualizing the number of babies given each name
  from 1880 to 2020 to observe trends and distributions. Highlight significant names
  like Helen and Ashley. Include text annotations to spotlight years with notable
  outliers or trends, providing context for peaks or drops. Annotate interesting data
  points, for example, the peak for Helen in 1882 or the emergence of Ashley in later
  years. Ensure the chart is easy to understand for social science research purposes,
  emphasizing clear comparison across different names and time periods. Utilize descriptive
  annotations for better insights.

  use (e.g., yearly, decade)?'
