initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot to visualize the trends in baby names over the
  years as provided in the dataset. The x-axis should represent the 'year' while the
  y-axis should represent the count of babies with each name (Amanda, Ashley, Betty,
  Deborah, Dorothy, Helen, Linda, Patricia). Each name should be represented by a
  different color or marker. Ensure that any missing values are adequately handled
  or excluded. Moreover, provide a legend to distinguish between the names and add
  appropriate labels for clarity. The purpose is to analyze how the popularity of
  these names has changed over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different names
  in the scatter plot?

  2. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer markers to be shapes, such as circles, squares, or triangles, or
  would you prefer lines connecting the points?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like to be displayed on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific ranges you would like to have set for the x-axis or y-axis?

  7. Would you like to include any additional information or annotations on the chart?'
