initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of babies named
  Amanda, Ashley, Betty, Deborah, Dorothy, Helen, Linda, and Patricia over the years
  1880, 1881, and 1882. Each group should represent a year, and each bar within a
  group should represent one of the names. The y-axis should show the number of babies,
  and the x-axis should show the years. Make sure to label the axes clearly.

  name?

  2. Would you like the chart to display gridlines?

  3. Do you want data labels showing the exact numbers on top of each bar?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you would prefer for the axis labels
  and title?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Do you have a preferred style for the bars (e.g., solid, striped)?

  7. Would you like to add any specific annotations or highlights on the chart to
  emphasize certain data points or trends?'
