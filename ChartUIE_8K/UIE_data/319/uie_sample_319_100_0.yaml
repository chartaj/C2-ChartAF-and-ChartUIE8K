initial_prompt: I would like to create a Heatmap to visualize the Japan LOTO7 draw
  data. The Heatmap should highlight the frequency of each main number drawn (main1
  to main7) across all draw dates. Use color intensity to indicate how often each
  number appears. Include text annotations to show the actual counts in the cells
  for clarity. Additionally, highlight draw dates with the highest and lowest sums
  (sum7 and sum9) to show trends and anomalies. This visualization aims to help analyze
  number patterns and potentially predict future draws.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to represent frequency?

  2. How would you like the color intensity scale to be defined (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  3. Would you prefer any specific format for the text annotations in the cells (e.g.,
  font size, font color)?

  4. How would you like the highest and lowest sums (sum7 and sum9) to be highlighted
  (e.g., specific border color, additional text annotations)?

  5. Are there any specific date formats you would prefer for representing draw dates?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or size of the heatmap?

  7. Should the chart include any specific titles, subtitles, or footnotes to aid
  interpretation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a specific color scheme.

  2. I do not know how the color intensity scale should be defined.

  3. I do not know about the specific format for the text annotations in the cells.

  4. I would like the highest and lowest sums to be highlighted with a specific border
  color.

  5. I have no specific preference for the date formats.

  6. I do not know about preferences for the layout or size of the heatmap.

  7. Yes, the chart should include a title, and if possible, a subtitle regarding
  the data range. No specific preference for footnotes.'
