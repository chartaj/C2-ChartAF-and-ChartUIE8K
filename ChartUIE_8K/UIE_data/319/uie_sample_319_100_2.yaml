initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the Japan LOTO7 draw data over
  time. Plot the 'sum7' and 'sum9' columns on the Y-axis and 'drawdate' on the X-axis
  to show trends. Highlight significant draws with above-average 'sum7' values using
  different colors or markers. Add text annotations for draws with maximum and minimum
  'sum7' values to highlight key points. The purpose is to easily identify trends
  and outliers in the draw data, making it simpler to analyze patterns and peaks over
  the given time period.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing ''sum7''
  and ''sum9''?

  2. Which specific shapes or markers would you prefer to use for highlighting significant
  draws with above-average ''sum7'' values?

  3. Should the line chart include a grid, and if so, should it be a major grid, minor
  grid, or both?

  4. Would you like to include a legend on the chart, and if so, where would you prefer
  it to be positioned?

  5. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations on the maximum
  and minimum ''sum7'' values?

  6. Do you have any preference for the date format on the X-axis labels (e.g., YYYY/MM/DD,
  MM/DD/YYYY)?

  7. Should the Y-axis have a fixed range or adapt automatically to the data’s range?

  8. Would you like to add data point markers along the lines, or should it be a smooth
  line without individual point markers?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, include a major grid.

  4. Yes, please include a legend. I do not have a specific preference for its position.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. YYYY/MM/DD format for the date on the X-axis labels would be good.

  7. The Y-axis should adapt automatically to the data’s range.

  8. Add data point markers along the lines.'
