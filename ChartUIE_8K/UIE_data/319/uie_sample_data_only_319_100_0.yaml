02_initial_prompt: I would like to create a Heatmap to visualize the Japan LOTO7 draw
  data. The Heatmap should highlight the frequency of each main number drawn (main1
  to main7) across all draw dates. Use color intensity to indicate how often each
  number appears. Include text annotations to show the actual counts in the cells
  for clarity. Additionally, highlight draw dates with the highest and lowest sums
  (sum7 and sum9) to show trends and anomalies. This visualization aims to help analyze
  number patterns and potentially predict future draws.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.
