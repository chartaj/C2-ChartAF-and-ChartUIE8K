initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the frequency each `main1` number
  appears in the Japan LOTO7 dataset. Make sure to label the x-axis as "Main1 Number"
  and the y-axis as "Frequency." Use different colors to differentiate the bars for
  a clearer visual representation. Additionally, include a title that states "Frequency
  Distribution of Main1 Numbers in Japan LOTO7 Draws." This will help us understand
  trends in the occurrences of different numbers across the lottery draws. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors you''d like
  for the bars?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the axis labels and title?

  3. Should the bars have borderlines or remain plain?

  4. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the legend (if included)?

  5. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, should
  they be on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  6. Is there a particular format you prefer for the number labels on the axes (e.g.,
  integer, comma-separated, etc.)?

  7. Do you want to include any specific data labels on the bars themselves?'
