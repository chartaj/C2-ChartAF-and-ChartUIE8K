initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the daily profit from our popup
  store business. Use the 'date' column for the x-axis to represent each day and the
  'profit' column for the y-axis to show the profit amount. Ensure each bar represents
  the profit for a specific day. The aim is to visualize the trend of our daily profits
  over time. It would be helpful if you could also include labels for the x-axis with
  dates and for the y-axis with the profit amounts. Thank you.
