initial_prompt: I'm planning a column chart to visualize our popup store's profits
  over time for internal business analysis. Please create a vertical column chart
  using the 'date' as the x-axis and 'profit' as the y-axis from the provided data.
  Each column should represent the profit for each corresponding date. Ensure the
  dates are in chronological order and clearly readable. Label the axes appropriately
  and use distinct colors for the columns to make the chart visually appealing and
  easy to understand. This will help us identify trends and make informed business
  decisions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the columns?

  2. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include data labels displaying the profit values on top of each
  column?

  4. Is there a specific format you would like for the date labels on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ''MM/DD/YYYY'', ''Month YYYY'')?

  5. Do you want any specific titles for the chart and the axes?

  6. Should we include any annotations or markers to highlight specific dates or profit
  values?

  7. Would you prefer the columns to have a standard width or to adjust dynamically
  based on the number of data points?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the axis labels and
  titles?'
