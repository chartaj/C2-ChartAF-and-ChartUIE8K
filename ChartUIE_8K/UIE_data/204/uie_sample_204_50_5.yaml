  be displayed side-by-side or overlaid?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or theme for the chart (e.g., minimalist, detailed,
  colorful)?

  5. Should we include grid lines on the histogram for better readability?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  7. Would you like to see any summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) displayed on
  the histogram?
