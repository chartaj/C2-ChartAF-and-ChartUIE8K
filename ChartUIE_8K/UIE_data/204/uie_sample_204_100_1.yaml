initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize real estate prices from the
  dataset. Highlight regions based on 'Y house price of unit area' with text annotations
  for highest and lowest price points. Use colors to differentiate prices, and include
  the number of convenience stores, house age, and distance to MRT stations as hover-over
  details. This will help identify patterns and factors affecting property prices.
  Ensure the map is easy to read and provides insights into price distribution across
  different areas. The goal is to understand how location factors influence real estate
  values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for the highest and lowest price points
  to be displayed (e.g., font size, color, placement)?

  3. Is there a specific map style you prefer (e.g., street map, satellite view, terrain)?

  4. Should any additional geographical boundaries or landmarks be included on the
  map for context?

  5. Do you have preferences for how the hover-over details are presented (e.g., tooltip
  format, information order)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Street map would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Tooltip format sounds fine. Start with the number of convenience stores, then
  house age, and finally the distance to MRT stations.'
