initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap of real estate prices, highlighting regions
  with varying house prices. Annotate areas with high and low price concentrations
  to emphasize trends. Include geographical coordinates, house age, and proximity
  to MRT stations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or gradients in mind for representing
  different price ranges on the heatmap?

  2. Would you prefer specific annotations or markers for high and low price concentrations,
  or should they be automatically generated based on the data?

  3. How detailed should the geographic boundaries be? Are city-level boundaries sufficient,
  or do you prefer neighborhood or district-level granularity?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for different
  house prices and other attributes?

  5. Do you have a preference for the type of map background (e.g., satellite, street
  map, terrain)?

  6. Should the heatmap focus on a particular region or cover a broader area?

  7. Are there any specific labeling or font preferences for annotations and axis
  titles?'
