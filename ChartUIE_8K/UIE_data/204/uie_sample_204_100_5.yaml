initial_prompt: I want to visualize a histogram based on the "real estate price prediction"
  data. Specifically, create a histogram for the "Y house price of unit area" column
  to see the distribution of house prices. Ensure the x-axis shows unit prices in
  intervals (like 0-10, 10-20, etc.) and the y-axis reflects the frequency of these
  prices. Additionally, use different color bars to represent different ranges of
  "X2 house age" (e.g., 0-10 years, 10-20 years, etc.) to see how house age affects
  unit prices. Display the legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different age ranges?

  2. What intervals would you prefer for the x-axis (unit prices)?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles?

  5. Do you have a particular font style and size preference for axis labels, legends,
  and titles?

  6. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart? If so, should they be both on the x and
  y axes?

  7. Would you like annotations or data labels on the bars?

  8. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. 10-unit intervals (like 0-10, 10-20, etc.).

  3. I do not know.

  4. Please label the x-axis as "Unit Price" and the y-axis as "Frequency".

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Right position for the legend.'
