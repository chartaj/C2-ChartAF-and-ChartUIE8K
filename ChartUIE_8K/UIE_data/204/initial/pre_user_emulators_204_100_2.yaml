  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart showing the trends in house prices over time. Use the 'X1 transaction
  date' on the x-axis and 'Y house price of unit area' on the y-axis. Highlight data
  points with text annotations that display values linked to each point to draw attention
  to specific price changes. Additionally, use different colors to emphasize significant
  trends or anomalies. The chart should help in understanding how house prices vary
  with factors like house age, distance to MRT station, number of convenience stores,
  and geographical location. Ensure clarity and focus on significant insights.
