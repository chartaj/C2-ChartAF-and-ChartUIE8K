initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing real estate prices based
  on various factors detailed in the dataset. Use the "Y house price of unit area"
  as the dependent variable (Y-axis) and "X3 distance to the nearest MRT station"
  as the independent variable (X-axis). Annotate key data points that show the highest
  and lowest house prices. Highlight points where the number of convenience stores
  (X4) is above 8. This will help us understand the influence of proximity to MRT
  stations and convenience stores on house prices. Provide clear and concise annotations
  and highlights to make the chart informative and engaging.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the scatter plot, particularly
  for the highlighted points?

  2. Would you like the annotations to include specific data values or just labels
  like ''Highest Price'' and ''Lowest Price''?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape or size of the markers for the data points?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for easier readability of the data points?

  5. Would you like trendlines or regression lines to be included in the scatter plot
  to show possible correlations more visibly?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to explain what the highlighted points represent?

  8. Do you have preferences for the format of the axis titles and labels?

  9. Would you like any specific background elements or themes in the chart (e.g.,
  light or dark background)?

  10. Should the chart title follow a particular format or include any specific text?'
