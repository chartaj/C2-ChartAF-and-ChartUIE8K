initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the proportion of unique values for
  the 'CHAS' and 'RAD' columns. Use highlights to emphasize sections with fewer unique
  values. This will help in understanding the distribution and focus on outliers in
  the real estate dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like section labels to include percentages, counts, or both?

  3. How would you like the highlights for sections with fewer unique values to be
  represented (e.g., different colors, patterns, opacity)?

  4. Should there be a legend included in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a specific order for the slices (e.g., ascending, descending, custom)?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Should the chart include annotations or tooltips for additional insights?

  8. Are there any specific font preferences for the chart labels and title?

  9. Would you like to include a background grid or any other background elements?'
