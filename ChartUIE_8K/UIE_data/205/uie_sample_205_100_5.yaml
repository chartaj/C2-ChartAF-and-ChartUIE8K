initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the real estate data using a line chart. The
  chart should compare the 'MEDV' (Median Value of Homes) with various other attributes
  like 'CRIM' (Crime rate), 'RM' (Number of rooms), and 'LSTAT' (Lower status of the
  population). Can you plot 'MEDV' on the y-axis and the selected features on the
  x-axis? Additionally, it would be helpful to color-code the lines for each feature
  to differentiate them easily. This way, I can observe how these features impact
  home values over different data points.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for color-coding\
  \ the lines?\n2. Would you like to add any labels or annotations on specific data\
  \ points or trends?\n3. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for\
  \ the axes?\n4. Do you want to include a legend to identify each feature being compared?\n\
  5. What level of granularity or data aggregation would you prefer for the x-axis\
  \ (e.g., monthly, yearly)? \n6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the\
  \ chart labels and titles?\n7. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better\
  \ readability? If so, should they be on both axes or just one?\n8. Are there any\
  \ specific range limits for the y-axis or x-axis that you would like to set?\n9.\
  \ Do you prefer any particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for the\
  \ different attributes?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the y-axis should be labeled as ''Median Value of Homes (MEDV)'' and the
  x-axis should be labeled for each feature (''CRIM'', ''RM'', ''LSTAT'').

  4. Yes, please include a legend.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a specific preference.

  7. Yes, grid lines on both axes would be helpful.

  8. I do not have any specific range limits.

  9. I am not sure.'
