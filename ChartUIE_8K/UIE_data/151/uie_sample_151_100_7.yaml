initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the dataset to visualize student
  performance. On the x-axis, plot the math scores, and on the y-axis, plot the reading
  scores. Differentiate the points on the scatter plot by the 'gender' of the students
  using different colors. Additionally, use different marker styles based on the 'test
  preparation course' status (completed vs. none). This will help in understanding
  the relationship between math and reading scores, and how gender and test preparation
  impact student performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the scatter plot?

  2. What labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Do you want to include a legend on the plot?

  4. If yes, do you have any specific preferences for the legend placement?

  5. Do you want to include grid lines on the plot?

  6. Are there any specific colors you prefer for differentiating genders on the plot?

  7. Do you have any marker style preferences for the ''test preparation course''
  status?

  8. Would you like to display data point annotations or labels for any specific points?

  9. Do you have a preference for the size of the markers?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to include on
  the chart, such as footnotes or subtitles?

  11. What font style and size do you prefer for the text in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. Math Scores for the x-axis and Reading Scores for the y-axis.

  3. Yes.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines.
