initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot to visualize the student performance data.
  The x-axis should represent the math scores, reading scores, and writing scores.
  The y-axis should be each student's index/ID. Use different colored dots to represent
  the three score categories (math, reading, writing) for each student. The data should
  be separated by variables like gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education,
  and test preparation course completion. Make sure the visualization clearly shows
  the distribution and comparison of student scores across these different categories.
  Interpret the data considering different lunch types. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different score
  categories (math, reading, writing) in the dot plot?

  2. How would you like the different categories (gender, race/ethnicity, parental
  level of education, etc.) to be visually represented in the chart (e.g., different
  shapes, color coding)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific order for the variables on the x-axis (i.e., math, reading,
  and writing scores)?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like included in the chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text elements in the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  located?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you have preferences for the range or scale of the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for easier comparison of
  scores? If yes, any particular style or color?

  10. Are there any specific benchmarks or reference lines you would like to include
  in the plot (e.g., average scores, pass/fail thresholds)?'
