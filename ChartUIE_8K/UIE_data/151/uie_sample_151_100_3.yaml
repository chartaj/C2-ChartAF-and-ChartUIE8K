initial_prompt: I would like a box chart visualizing the distribution of 'math score',
  'reading score', and 'writing score' from the student performance data. The chart
  should display the median, quartiles, and any outliers for these scores. Additionally,
  please categorize the data by 'gender' to compare male and female students' performance
  in these subjects. Ensure to label the axes, and provide a legend to indicate the
  different genders. This way, it will be easier to interpret and analyze how gender
  might impact academic performance in math, reading, and writing. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different genders in the
  chart?

  2. Would you prefer the data to be displayed horizontally or vertically on the box
  plots?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences or size requirements for the axis labels
  and legend?

  4. Should the outliers be displayed using a specific symbol or default settings
  are fine?

  5. Do you want any specific titles or subtitles for the chart?

  6. Is there any specific order you would like the subjects to be displayed in the
  chart?

  7. Are there any specific ranges for the axes you would like to set?'
