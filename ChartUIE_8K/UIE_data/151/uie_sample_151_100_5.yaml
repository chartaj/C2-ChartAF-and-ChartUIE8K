initial_prompt: I'd like to see a histogram showing the distribution of math scores
  among students. Please ensure that the x-axis represents the range of math scores
  and the y-axis reflects the number of students falling within each score range.
  Additionally, it would be helpful to differentiate the data by 'gender' using different
  colors or patterns to demonstrate any potential differences in performance between
  male and female students. This visualization will aid in understanding how math
  scores vary across the student population based on gender. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors for differentiating
  between male and female students in the histogram?

  2. What bin size or range intervals would you prefer for the math scores on the
  x-axis?

  3. Would you like the histogram to display counts as the y-axis values or percentages?

  4. Should the histogram include any additional labels or annotations to highlight
  key points or trends?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the histogram''s title or axis labels?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the categories (male and female) to
  be displayed in?

  7. Would you prefer a specific style or design for the gender differentiation (e.g.,
  solid colors, patterns, shades)?'
