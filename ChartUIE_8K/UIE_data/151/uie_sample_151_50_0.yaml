initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize student performance based on gender,
  race/ethnicity, and parental education level. Highlight and annotate exceptional
  scores to identify key trends and disparities. Use annotations to draw attention
  to notable patterns in math, reading, and writing scores.

  boxes)?

  4. Should the bar chart include a legend to differentiate between categories? If
  yes, any specific preferences?

  5. How would you like the axes to be labeled (e.g., title, font size, font style)?

  6. Do you want to group the bars by gender, race/ethnicity, or parental level of
  education first?

  7. Are there any specific notable patterns or trends you would like to emphasize
  aside from exceptional scores?

  8. Should the chart include any additional statistical indicators (e.g., mean, median)
  for reference?

  9. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  10. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the chart title and subtitles?'
