initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the prices of different
  organic products in Sydney groceries. Use the categories "Product Name," "Product
  Category," "Product Price (INR)" and "Quantity" for the stacks. Highlight variations
  in prices with color and include text annotations to show specific price values
  for key products. The chart should help in comparing the prices and appreciating

  to significant price differences or unique products.

  in the chart?
