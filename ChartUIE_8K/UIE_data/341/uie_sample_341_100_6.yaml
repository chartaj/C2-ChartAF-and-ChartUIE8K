initial_prompt: Can you create a geographic heatmap indicating the price distribution
  of various grocery items sold in Sydney, detailed by their product categories from
  the given data? Please focus on highlighting hotspots where certain categories,
  such as organic products, are more expensive, and where prices are lower. This heatmap
  will help visualize and compare the cost variability of these products across different
  areas in Sydney. Specifically, emphasize the variations in the prices when converted
  to INR, as it provides a better understanding for our target audience. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap to highlight differences
  in price distribution?

  2. Should the heatmap include legends to indicate price ranges and categories?

  3. Would you like to use specific markers or annotations for high and low price
  hotspots?

  4. Do you have a preference for the geographical granularity (e.g., neighborhood,
  district) to be shown on the map?

  5. Should the heatmap display any particular labels (e.g., category names, price
  indicators) on hover or directly on the map?

  6. Is there a specific map style or basemap (e.g., satellite, terrain, street) you
  would prefer?

  7. Do you want to include any filters on the heatmap to selectively view certain
  product categories or price ranges?

  8. Would you like to display any summary statistics or insights alongside the heatmap?'
