initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for the Indian Grocery Prices in Sydney dataset.
  Use Product Categories as rows and Product Names as columns with product prices
  in INR as the metric. The heatmap should visually represent price variations in
  different product categories. Ensure the color scale accurately reflects price differences,
  with distinct colors for lower and higher price ranges. Missing values must be highlighted
  if any. Include annotations for exact prices on the heatmap cells for precise reference.
  This visual should help us identify which product categories have higher or lower
  overall prices quickly.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap to distinguish
  price ranges?

  2. How would you like missing values to be highlighted in the heatmap?

  3. Do you have a preference for font size and style for the annotations of exact
  prices on the cells?

  4. Should the heatmap include gridlines between the cells for better readability?

  5. Would you like any specific annotations or labels for the highest and lowest
  prices?

  6. Do you have any specific layout preferences for the chart''s legend (positioning,
  size, etc.)?

  7. How detailed should the tick marks and labels be for the rows (Product Categories)
  and columns (Product Names)?'
