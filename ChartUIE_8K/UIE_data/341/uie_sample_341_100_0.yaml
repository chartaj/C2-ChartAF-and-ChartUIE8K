initial_prompt: I need a bar chart displaying the prices of different organic products
  available in Sydney. The chart should compare prices in USD and INR. Highlight the
  highest and lowest-priced items. Include annotations specifying the product categories
  and quantities for better understanding. This will help illustrate the cost variations
  of organic grocery items for customers looking to make informed purchasing decisions.
  Make sure to label all categories clearly for easy comparison. Use data from the
  "Indian Grocery Prices in Sydney" dataset and highlight significant data points
  to draw viewer attention.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked for the USD and INR price comparisons?

  3. How would you like the highest and lowest-priced items to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different color, bold border)?

  4. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Should the annotations for product categories and quantities be inside or outside
  the bars?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the grid lines (e.g., dotted, solid, none)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed on the
  chart?'
