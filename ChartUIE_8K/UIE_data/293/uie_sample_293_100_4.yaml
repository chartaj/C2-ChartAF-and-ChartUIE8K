initial_prompt: 'I''d like to create a histogram that shows the distribution of missing
  values across the different columns in this Online Retail Data Set. Specifically,
  I want to see how many values are missing in each column: Column 1 through Column
  6. This will help me understand which columns have the most missing data and prioritize
  my data cleaning efforts. Could you provide a visual representation that highlights
  how many missing values are in each column? A bar chart will work best for this
  purpose. Thank you!'

  missing values?
