02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the health status of honey bees
  across different locations and dates in the BeeImage Dataset. Use the provided data
  with columns - 'location', 'date', and 'health'. Each cell in the heatmap should
  represent the count of a specific health status for honey bees at a particular location
  and date. This visualization will help in identifying patterns in bee health over
  time and across different regions. Ensure the heatmap is color-coded to differentiate
  varying counts, making it easier to spot trends and anomalies in the dataset.
