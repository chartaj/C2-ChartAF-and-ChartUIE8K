initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the health statuses of honey bees
  based on the provided dataset. Use the 'health' column to categorize and count the
  number of occurrences for each health condition. Annotate each bar with the exact
  count to highlight key data points. Add colors to the bars to differentiate between
  health statuses, making it easier to understand the distribution at a glance. This
  visualization will help understand the prevalence of different health conditions
  in the bee population from various locations. Ensure the chart is clear and the
  annotations are prominent for easy interpretation.

  9. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, do you have a
  preference for their style and color?
