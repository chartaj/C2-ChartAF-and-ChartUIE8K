initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart visualizing the global mobile phone sales
  by vendor from Q1 '10 to Q3 '10. The chart should include lines for Samsung, Nokia/Microsoft,
  Apple, LG, ZTE, and Huawei. The x-axis should represent the quarters, and the y-axis
  should show the sales figures. Ensure it is clear and distinguishable by using different
  colors for each vendor. The chart should highlight trends and changes in the sales
  data across these periods. This will help in understanding the performance of each
  vendor over the given timeframe.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  vendors?

  2. Would you like data point markers on the lines to emphasize specific sales figures?

  3. Should the chart include a legend for identifying the vendor lines?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the spline lines (e.g., smooth, dashed)?

  5. Do you require grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or labels to highlight significant points
  or trends?

  7. Are there any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?'
