initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart visualizing mobile phone sales by quarter
  for Samsung, Nokia/Microsoft, Apple, LG, ZTE, and Huawei. Highlight key trends and
  include annotations for notable points to draw attention to rising or falling sales.
  Use different colors for each vendor for clarity. Ensure the chart is easy to read
  and helps in understanding overall market trends. Include annotations to provide
  context, comparisons, and insights into specific data points. This visualization
