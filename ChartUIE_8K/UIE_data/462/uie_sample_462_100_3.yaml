initial_prompt: Please create a radar chart showing the quarterly global mobile phone
  sales by vendor for Samsung, Nokia/Microsoft, Apple, LG, ZTE, and Huawei, using
  the data provided. The chart should compare all vendors over the first three quarters
  of 2010. Make sure the axes represent the sales figures and each vendor is represented
  by a separate line. This will help visualize the performance and market position
  of each vendor relative to others over these quarters.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the lines representing
  each vendor?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels at each data point?

  3. Should the chart have a title and, if so, what should it be?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to identify each vendor, and where would you
  prefer it to be located?

  5. Are there specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) you would like for different
  vendors?

  6. Would you like the grid lines to be shown on the radar chart, and if so, any
  preference on their appearance?

  7. Should there be any specific annotations or highlights on certain data points
  or quarters?

  8. Do you have a preference for the axis scaling and limits (e.g., automatic scaling
  vs. fixed values)?

  9. Would you like to include any additional text or footnotes in the chart for context?'
