02_initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the global mobile phone sales
  by vendor. The vendors are Samsung, Nokia/Microsoft, Apple, LG, ZTE, and Huawei,
  with data spanning multiple quarters. Highlight the median sales values and annotate
  significant outliers for each vendor. This helps in understanding sales performance
  variances across vendors and time. Use different colors to distinguish each vendor,
  making it easy to compare their performance. The purpose is to identify trends and
  outliers in vendor sales, assisting business decisions based on market performance
  insights. Keep annotations clear to focus on standout data points.
