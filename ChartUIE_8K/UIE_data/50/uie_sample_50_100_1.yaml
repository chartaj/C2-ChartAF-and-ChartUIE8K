initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the influence of social platforms
  on online shopping. Highlight and annotate key platforms like Facebook, Instagram,
  and Snapchat in the chart. Include segments for different device types and global
  results to show overall trends. Ensure the chart emphasizes the most influential
  platforms by modifying their appearance (color or size). The visualization should
  provide clear insights into which social media channels are driving online shopping
  behaviors. This will help in understanding customer preferences and improving marketing
  strategies in the social influence on shopping context.
