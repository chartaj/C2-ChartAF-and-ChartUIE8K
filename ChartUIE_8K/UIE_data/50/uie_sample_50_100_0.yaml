  Create a column chart visualizing the influence of social platforms on online shopping,
  focusing on the global mobile segment. Highlight the platforms with the highest
  influence and annotate the chart with the respective percentages of influence for
  Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. The chart should emphasize the differences between
  these platforms in terms of their impact on consumer behavior. Ensure the annotations
  clearly display the count and percentage values to provide context. This visualization
  will help marketers understand which platforms are most effective for driving online
  shopping.
