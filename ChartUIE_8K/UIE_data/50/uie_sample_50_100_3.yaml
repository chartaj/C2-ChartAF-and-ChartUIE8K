initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the impact of different social platforms
  on online shopping behavior based on the given data. Highlight the proportion of
  each platform (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) influencing online purchases.
  Ensure each segment of the pie chart is labeled with the corresponding platform
  name and its percentage. This will help in understanding the primary drivers behind
  social media-influenced shopping for marketing strategies. Use distinct colors for
  each segment to clearly differentiate the platforms. The focus should be on overall
  trends, so there's no need for detailed segment-by-segment breakdowns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific color palette to be used
  for the distinct segments?

  4. Should the percentages be displayed inside the pie segments or outside with leader
  lines?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title or any other text annotations?

  6. Are there any specific platforms or categories that should be highlighted or
  emphasized more than others?

  the pie chart segments?'
