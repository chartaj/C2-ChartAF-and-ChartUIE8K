initial_prompt: Visualize the grain area and weight using a histogram. Highlight genotype
  differences. Annotations should emphasize notable data points and key statistics
  to assist in agricultural analysis and decision-making for farming efficiency.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the histogram?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?

  3. Do you have specific preferences for the bin size of the histogram?

  4. How would you prefer the genotype differences to be highlighted (e.g., different
  colors, patterns)?

  5. Do you have any specific annotations or key statistics that you would like to
  emphasize?

  6. What level of detail would you like for the annotations (e.g., summary statistics,
  notable outliers)?

  7. Would you prefer a specific layout for the axis labels and titles?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart labels and
  annotations?

  9. Are there any specific data points or ranges that you want to be explicitly emphasized?

  10. Do you prefer any specific aspect ratio or orientation (e.g., landscape, portrait)
  for the chart?'
