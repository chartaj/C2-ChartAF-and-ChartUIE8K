initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot illustrating Wheat grain area (x-axis) versus
  weight (y-axis) using the provided data. Highlight specific genotypes for better
  comparison, focusing on variations in length, width, and field blocks. Add textual
  annotations to certain data points to emphasize notable grain sizes and weights.
  This visualization aims to assist researchers in identifying patterns and outliers
  in wheat grain characteristics. The scatter plot should distinguish between different
  genotypes and field blocks to make any significant differences easily recognizable.
  Use colors and sizes to visually represent these distinctions effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between genotypes
  and field blocks?

  2. Are there specific genotypes that you want to be highlighted more prominently?

  3. How would you like the sizes of data points to be represented in the scatter
  plot?

  4. Do you have preferences for the type or format of textual annotations for notable
  grain sizes and weights?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading to better view patterns
  and outliers?

  6. Do you prefer any specific legend placement or format to differentiate between
  genotypes and field blocks?

  7. Are there any specific markers or shapes you prefer for the data points related
  to different genotypes or field blocks?

  8. Would you like to include a trend line or any other specific elements to aid
  pattern recognition?

  9. Do you prefer axis labels and titles in any particular style or format?'
