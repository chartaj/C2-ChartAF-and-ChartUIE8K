initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of wheat grain areas
  and weights from an agricultural dataset. Use different colors for area and weight
  to distinguish them clearly. Annotate specific data points with text annotations
  to highlight significant values or outliers, focusing the viewer's attention on
  these elements. Also, use highlights to emphasize major trends or anomalies in the
  data. This visualization will help in understanding the variation in wheat grain
  measurements and can aid in agricultural analysis and decision-making. Ensure the
  chart is clear and easy to understand, with appropriate labels and legends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for distinguishing between the
  area and weight data?

  2. Are there any specific significant values or outliers you would like annotated,
  or should they be identified automatically?

  3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal histograms?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the major trends or anomalies to be highlighted?

  5. Would you like a specific title for the histogram?

  6. Are there any specific labels or legends you want on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis scales, such as linear or logarithmic?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  9. Do you want grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  10. Are there any other specific details or elements you want included in the visualization
  to make it more effective for your analysis?'
