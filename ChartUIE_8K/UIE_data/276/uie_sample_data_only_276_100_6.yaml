02_initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize wheat grain area and weight data.
  X-axis should represent Length, and the Y-axis should represent Weight. Each dot
  should be colored according to the Field and shaped based on the Genotype. Also,
  include a legend to differentiate Field and Genotype easily. This will help in analyzing
  variations in length and weight across different fields and genotypes. Additionally,
  ensure the data points for Length and Weight are clearly marked for easier comparison.
  Please provide an insight into any notable patterns you observe. Thank you!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
