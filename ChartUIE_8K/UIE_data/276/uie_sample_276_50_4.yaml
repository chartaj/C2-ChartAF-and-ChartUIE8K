initial_prompt: Create a box chart displaying the distribution of wheat grain lengths,
  widths, areas, and weights. Separate the data by genotype and field for comparative
  analysis. This will help visualize variations in the physical properties of wheat
  grains grown in different conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme or palette for distinguishing
  different genotypes and fields?

  2. Would you like the box chart to include individual data points (jittered) or
  just the summary statistics?

  3. Do you have a specific order in which the genotypes and fields should be displayed?

  4. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like on the axes and the chart?

  5. Would you prefer the distribution of lengths, widths, areas, and weights to be
  displayed on separate boxes or grouped together?

  6. Should outliers be shown explicitly in the box chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart orientation (vertical or horizontal)?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines or background shading to enhance readability?

  9. Are there specific legends or annotations you would like added to the chart for
  clarity?

  10. Would you prefer any specific font style or sizes for the chart labels and titles?'
