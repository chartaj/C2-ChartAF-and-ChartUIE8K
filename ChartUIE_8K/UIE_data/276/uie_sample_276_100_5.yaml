initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the wheat grain data. Specifically,
  I want to compare the Length, Width, Area, and Weight across different Genotypes
  and Fields. Each bar should represent a Field, stacked segments in the bar should
  show the values of Length, Width, Area, and Weight for each Genotype. Include a
  legend to differentiate between Length, Width, Area, and Weight. Make sure all values
  are clearly labelled for better understanding. This visualization will help in analyzing
  the variations in the wheat grain attributes across different Genotypes and Fields.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different attributes (Length,
  Width, Area, Weight)?

  2. Do you prefer any specific order for the Fields or Genotypes on the x-axis?

  3. Should any value ranges or thresholds be highlighted within the chart?

  4. Do you have a preference for the location of the legend on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  5. Do you want data labels to be displayed inside or outside the stacked segments?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you wish to use for labels and legends?

  7. Do you prefer any specific bar width or spacing between bars?

  8. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it be automatically adjusted
  based on data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Bottom would be fine, but I am not sure.

  5. I prefer data labels to be displayed inside the stacked segments.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Auto-adjust based on data.'
