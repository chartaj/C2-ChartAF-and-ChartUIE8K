initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of the 'Length',
  'Width', 'Area', and 'Weight' columns from the Wheat grain area and weight dataset.
  Make sure to label each axis appropriately and include a title for the chart. Highlight
  any outliers in the data. The box chart should help to understand the range and
  spread of these measurements across different samples. Ensure the chart is clear
  and easy to interpret for an agricultural research analysis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend in the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the font style and size for the axis
  labels and title?

  4. Should the chart background be a specific color or pattern?

  5. Is there any additional information you would like to include on the chart such
  as annotations or reference lines?

  6. Do you prefer a particular orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Should the whiskers of the box plots extend to particular percentiles (e.g.,
  1.5 IQR, min/max)?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for how outliers should be highlighted (e.g.,
  color, shape)?'
