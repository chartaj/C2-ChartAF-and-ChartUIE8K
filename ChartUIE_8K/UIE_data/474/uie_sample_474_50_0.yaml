initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart visualizing the number of Autocracies
  and Democracies from 1930 to 2018. Highlight key transitions and changes over the
  decades. Provide text annotations for significant years (e.g., first year with more
  democracies). This is for understanding political shifts historically.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different categories
  (Autocracies and Democracies) in the stacked area chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a legend specifying what each color represents?

  3. Do you have a preferred style or font size for the text annotations?

  4. Is there a particular format for the axes and gridlines you prefer (e.g., major
  ticks every decade)?

  5. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the y-axis range? Should it be automatically
  scaled or set to a fixed range?

  7. Would you like to include labels for each data point on the chart or just for
  the significant years?

  8. Should the key transitions and changes over the decades be highlighted using
  markers, lines, or another method?

  9. Do you have preferences for the background color of the chart?

  10. Would you like the chart to include any source or dataset references at the
  bottom?'
