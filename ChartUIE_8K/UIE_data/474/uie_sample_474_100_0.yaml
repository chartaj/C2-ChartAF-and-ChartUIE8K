initial_prompt: Create a stacked area chart using the given data, focusing on the
  trends of 'Autocracies' and 'Democracies' from 1930 to 2018. The x-axis will represent
  the years, while the y-axis will depict the number of 'Autocracies' and 'Democracies'.
  Annotate key points such as major shifts or significant changes in trends, especially
  highlighting the transition periods like the 1990s where a significant increase
  in democracies is observed. Use distinct colors to differentiate between 'Autocracies'
  and 'Democracies' for better visual clarity. This will help illustrate the overall
  political landscape evolution over time.
