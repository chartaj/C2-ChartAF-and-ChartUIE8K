initial_prompt: Create a slope chart comparing the number of Autocracies and Democracies
  across different decades from 1930 to 2018. Annotate significant shifts, such as
  the increase in Democracies from 2000 to 2018. Highlight the years with the most
  notable changes in regime types. This visualization aims to emphasize trends and
  transitions in political regimes over time, drawing attention to the growth of democracies
  and the decline of autocracies. Use text annotations to provide context on years
  where significant changes occur, helping viewers quickly grasp key points in the
  data.
