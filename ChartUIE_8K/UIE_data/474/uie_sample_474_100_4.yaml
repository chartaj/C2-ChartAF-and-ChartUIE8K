initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the changes in the number of autocracies
  and democracies from 1930 to 2018. Use the years as the x-axis and the number of
  countries as the y-axis. In the chart, separate the data for autocracies and democracies
  into different colored areas to highlight the differences and trends over the decades.
  Make sure the areas are stacked to show the total number of countries per year.
  This will help illustrate how the number of autocratic and democratic countries
  has evolved over time in a clear and engaging manner.
