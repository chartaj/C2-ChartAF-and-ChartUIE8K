initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total amount spent
  by each lobbyist over different reporting periods. Highlight the 'Lobbyist Name'
  to distinguish between entries with slight variations in naming. Use data annotations
  to display the total amount spent for each lobbyist during each period, emphasizing
  those that have higher expenditures. This chart should help examine spending trends,
  making it clear which lobbyist has the highest influence expenditure in each reporting
  cycle. The purpose is to easily compare lobbying efforts over time and identify
  any significant changes or patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the lobbyist names to be color-coded or distinguished using patterns?

  3. Should the data annotations display the exact values, or would you prefer rounded
  numbers?

  4. How would you like high expenditures to be emphasized in the data annotations?
  For example, bolder font or a different color?

  5. Should there be grid lines on the chart for better readability, or do you prefer
  a cleaner look without them?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to clarify the color coding or differentiation
  used for various lobbyists?

  7. Would you like to include labels for the start and end dates of each reporting
  period on the x-axis?

  8. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  9. Should the stacked bars be sorted in any specific order, such as by the total
  expenditure or by reporting period?'
