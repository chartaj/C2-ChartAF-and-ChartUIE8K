  Monthly Report data. Plot the Date Filed on the x-axis and the Total Amount Spent
  to Influence on the y-axis. Use text annotations to highlight specific data points,
  especially where the Total Amount Spent to Influence is highest. Use highlights
  like different colors or sizes to emphasize the different Lobbyist Names and to
  distinguish between various Report Types. Make sure missing values are addressed
  clearly, perhaps with a note or a different marker. This helps understand lobbying
  expenditure trends over time.
