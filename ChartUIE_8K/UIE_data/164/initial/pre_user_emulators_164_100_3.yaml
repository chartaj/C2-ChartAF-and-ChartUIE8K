  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually.\n<end of the annotation\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Grouped bar/column chart that utilizes the data
  format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Grouped bar/column
  chart that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a grouped bar chart visualizing the total amount spent to influence
  by each lobbyist over the different filing periods. For each lobbyist, display the
  expenditures as bars grouped by period start date. Make sure the lobbyist names
  are properly consolidated where there are variations (e.g., "Airbnb Inc," "Airbnb
  Inc.," and "Airbnb, Inc." should be treated as one). Additionally, include tooltips
  to show detailed information for each bar, such as the exact amount, report type,
  and period end date.
