  lobbying activities over time. Use the "Date Filed" on the x-axis and "Total Amount
  Spent to Influence" on the y-axis. Display separate lines for each unique "Lobbyist
  Name" to compare their lobbying expenditures. Include markers at each data point
  for clarity. Ensure labels and a legend to distinguish between the lobbyists. This
