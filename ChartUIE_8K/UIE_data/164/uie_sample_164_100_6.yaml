initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing the total amount spent to influence by
  each lobbyist, based on the given data. Each bar should represent a different lobbyist.
  Ensure that all unique lobbyist names are combined into single entries (e.g., "Airbnb
  Inc," "Airbnb Inc.," and "Airbnb, Inc." should be treated as one). The x-axis should
  list the lobbyist names, and the y-axis should show the total amount spent. Include
  data from all provided time periods. Color-code the bars to easily distinguish between
  different lobbyists. Also, account for missing values and handle them appropriately.

  2. How would you like missing values to be handled (e.g., exclude bars with missing
  data, fill with zero)?

  4. Do you prefer the bars to be sorted in a particular order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by total amount spent)?
