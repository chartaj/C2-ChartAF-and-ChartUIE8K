initial_prompt: Create a histogram to evaluate higher education student performance.
  Use columns like 'AGE', 'CUML_GPA', and 'EXP_GPA' to measure distributions. Highlight
  key elements such as 'GENDER' and 'SCHOLARSHIP' to distinguish different student
  groups. Incorporate text annotations to emphasize standout data points or trends.
  The purpose is to visually understand how different factors influence GPA among
  students. This will help in identifying areas for academic support and resource
  allocation. The histogram should be engaging, making it easier for educators and
  administrators to digest the data quickly.
