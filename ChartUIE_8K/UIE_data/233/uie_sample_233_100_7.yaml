initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different factors
  affecting higher education students' performance. Use data from '233.csv'. Display
  the relationships between variables like 'AGE', 'GENDER', 'HS_TYPE', 'SCHOLARSHIP',
  'STUDY_HRS', 'READ_FREQ', 'ATTEND_DEPT', 'CUML_GPA', and 'EXP_GPA'. Highlight the
  strength of correlations using a gradient color scale. Ensure clear labeling for
  all axes and legend for color coding to interpret the correlations easily. Provide
  a clear title "Correlation between Factors and GPA in Higher Education" to give
  context to the visual.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the specific color gradient to be used
  on the heatmap?

  2. Should we follow any specific scheme for labeling the axes and legends (e.g.,
  abbreviations, full forms)?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to include gridlines for easier readability?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels, title, and legend?

  5. Should the heatmap include any specific annotations or notes for certain data
  points?'
