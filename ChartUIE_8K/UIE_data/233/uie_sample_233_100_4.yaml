initial_prompt: Create a box plot that visualizes the distribution of 'CUML_GPA',
  'EXP_GPA', and 'GRADE' across the student population. This should help in understanding
  the spread and central tendency of students' performance evaluations. Additionally,
  provide separate box plots segmented by 'GENDER' to explore any differences in academic
  performance between male and female students. Use distinct colors for each grade
  variable and add appropriate axis labels and a title that reflects the objective
  of assessing higher education students' performance. This will help in identifying
  outliers and overall trends in students' academic outcomes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct grade variables?

  2. What should the title of the chart be?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels?

  4. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers for outliers?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order in which the boxes for ''CUML_GPA'', ''EXP_GPA'',
  and ''GRADE'' are displayed?

  6. Are there any specific statistical metrics (e.g., mean, median) that you would
  like to display on the box plots?

  7. Do you have any specific format or style preferences for the box plots (e.g.,
  whisker range, box width)?

  8. Would you like to add a legend to explain the colors used for each grade variable?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. The title of the chart should be "Distribution of Student Performance Evaluations
  by Gender".

  3. I am not sure about the axis labels, but they should be appropriate for the data.

  4. I do not know if specific annotations or markers for outliers are needed.

  5. I do not have a preference for the order of the boxes.

  6. I would like to display the median on the box plots.

  7. I am not sure about the format or style preferences for the box plots.

  8. Yes, please add a legend to explain the colors used for each grade variable.'
