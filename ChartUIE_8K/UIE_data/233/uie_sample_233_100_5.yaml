initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the distribution of different
  variables like AGE, GENDER, HS_TYPE, SCHOLARSHIP, and SALARY among Higher Education
  Students. Use different colors to represent each category within the columns for
  easy comparison. For instance, each column can represent a variable, and its segments
  can show the distribution of unique values. The x-axis should have variable names,
  and the y-axis should have the count of students. This chart will help in understanding
  the demographic and academic background of students. Ensure each section is properly
  labeled for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to represent
  each category within the columns?

  2. Would you like to display the exact count of students within each segment of
  the stacked column chart?

  3. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and axis
  titles?

  4. Should there be a legend included to identify the categories represented by different
  colors?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you want the variables (AGE, GENDER, HS_TYPE,
  SCHOLARSHIP, and SALARY) to be displayed on the x-axis?

  6. Would you like to add gridlines for better readability of the chart? If yes,
  do you prefer horizontal, vertical, or both types of gridlines?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart title or any additional subtitles?

  8. Is there a specific format you want for the y-axis scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?'
