initial_prompt: Create a violin plot to visualize student performance based on cumulative
  GPA (CUML_GPA) and expected GPA (EXP_GPA). Highlight the distribution of grades
  across different education levels of parents (MOTHER_EDU, FATHER_EDU) and type of
  high school (HS_TYPE). Use text annotations to mark average study hours (STUDY_HRS)
  and reading frequency (READ_FREQ) for each distribution to provide context. The
  aim is to help educators understand the impact of parental education and high school
  type on student performance, facilitating better academic support strategies. Highlights
  should distinguish notable trends in GPA distributions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating the
  distributions based on parental education levels and high school types?

  2. What kind of text annotations style do you prefer for marking average study hours
  and reading frequency (e.g., font size, color, format)?

  3. Do you want to include any specific legends or labels for the different categories
  of parental education and high school types?

  4. Would you prefer the violin plots to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  5. Are there any specific trends or patterns you would like to highlight within
  the GPA distributions? If so, how would you prefer them to be distinguished (e.g.,
  specific colors, markers)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the scale or range of the GPA on the axes?

  7. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the overall chart
  and individual sections?

  8. Are there any specific data points or outliers you want to be emphasized within
  the violin plot?

  9. What level of granularity do you prefer for the distribution (e.g., bin width
  for the density plot within the violin)?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the overall layout or design of the
  chart (e.g., background color, grid lines, margins)?'
