initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize data from the student performance
  evaluation dataset. Please create a bar chart showing the average cumulative GPA
  (CUML_GPA) for students grouped by gender (GENDER). Include text annotations to
  highlight the GPA values for each gender. Use different colors to distinguish between
  genders. Additionally, highlight the bar representing the highest average cumulative
  GPA. The purpose is to analyze the impact of gender on academic performance in higher

  genders and provide valuable insights for educational planning and support.
