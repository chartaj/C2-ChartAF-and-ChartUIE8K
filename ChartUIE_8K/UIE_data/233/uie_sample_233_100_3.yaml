initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to compare the GPA (CUML_GPA and
  EXP_GPA) of students. Use the STUDENTID for the x-axis and plot their cumulative
  GPA and expected GPA side by side for each student. Highlight each student's performance
  differences based on their ID. Ensure each bar is distinctly colored for easy comparison.
  This will help visualize the performance evaluation of higher education students
  by comparing their cumulative and expected GPAs effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars?

  2. Should there be specific colors for cumulative GPA and expected GPA, or should
  they be randomized?

  3. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for easier reading of values?

  4. Should we include data labels on top of each bar indicating the exact GPA values?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Would you like to set a custom title for the chart or use a default one?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the x-axis and y-axis range settings?

  8. Should we add a legend to differentiate between cumulative GPA and expected GPA?

  9. Do you have any layout preferences for the chart elements (e.g., position of
  the legend, orientation of the bars)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please add a legend to differentiate between cumulative GPA and expected
  GPA.
