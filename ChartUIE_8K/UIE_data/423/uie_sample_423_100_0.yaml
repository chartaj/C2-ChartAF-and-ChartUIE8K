initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the mass of fallen meteorites over
  the years. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight significant meteorites
  like "Aachen" (1880) and "Aarhus" (1951). Highlight these points by modifying the
  appearance, using larger dots or different colors, to emphasize their importance.
  The chart should show trends and anomalies in meteorite falls over time, aiding
  in their scientific study and public interest in space and astronomy. Provide context
  and editorial comments where relevant to engage the audience further. This will
  help in educating viewers about meteorite falls.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line and highlighted
  points?

  2. Would you like the titles and axis labels to display in a particular font or
  style?

  3. Is there a preferred size for the annotations and data labels?

  4. Should the annotations include only the year and name of the meteorite, or additional
  information such as mass and class?

  5. Do you have a preferred background or grid style for the chart?

  6. Would you prefer the trend line to be smoothed or to connect the points directly
  with straight lines?

  7. Do you want a legend explaining the colors and symbols used for significant meteorites?

  8. Is there a specific way you''d like the x-axis and y-axis to be scaled or any
  particular breaks/intervals for time (years) and mass?

  9. Should the editorial comments be placed at specific points on the chart, or is
  it acceptable to place them in a free-form manner?'
