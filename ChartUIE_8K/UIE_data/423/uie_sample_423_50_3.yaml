  Use latitude and longitude to plot points, with color intensity representing the
  mass of the meteorites. Include data like year of fall and meteorite classification
  for tooltips.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for representing the mass intensity
  on the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the meteorite classifications to be displayed in the tooltips?

  3. Is there a specific map style or background (e.g., satellite, terrain, road map)
  you prefer for the geographic heatmap?

  4. Are there any specific years or time ranges you want to emphasize or filter on
  the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include any legends or annotations to highlight specific areas
  or meteorite falls?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I would like to focus on the period between 1900 and present.

  5. Yes, including legends would be helpful.'
