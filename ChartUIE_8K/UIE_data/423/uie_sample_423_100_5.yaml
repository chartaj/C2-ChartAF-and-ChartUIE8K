initial_prompt: I need a pie chart based on the fallen meteorites dataset. The chart
  should show the proportion of different meteorite classes based on their mass. Each
  slice represents a unique meteorite class from the 'class' column, and the size
  of each slice should be determined by the total mass of meteorites in that class.
  Please ensure the chart is titled appropriately to reflect its focus on meteorite
  masses by class. Include a legend to identify each class clearly. This is for a
  space and astronomy presentation, so the chart should be visually engaging.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the pie
  chart?

  2. Do you prefer the chart to have any specific font style or size for the labels
  and title?

  3. Would you like the chart to include any specific annotations or data labels for
  each slice?

  4. Are there any specific slice separation or ''explosion'' effects that you want
  for emphasis on certain categories?

  5. Do you have any preference for the placement and style of the legend (e.g., inside
  or outside the chart, horizontally or vertically aligned)?

  6. What specific title would you like for the chart?

  7. Do you have any preference for the background color or overall theme of the chart?

  8. Would you like to include additional information in tooltips when hovering over
  the pie slices (e.g., exact mass values)?

  9. Do you prefer the chart to have a border or any specific styling around the slices?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Yes, include data labels for each slice.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. "Proportion of Meteorite Masses by Class"

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. No, additional information in tooltips is not necessary.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
