initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart showing 'Pollution Index', 'Water Temp', and
  'Dissolved Oxygen(mg/L)' over time. I want to observe any visible trends or correlations
  between these parameters.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. How would you like the y-axis to be scaled (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  3. Would you like to display gridlines on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer having a legend to identify each parameter?

  5. Should the data points be highlighted, marked, or represented with a different
  style?

  6. Would you like to include data labels on the chart?

  7. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  8. Do you have specific preferences for labeling the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Should there be any annotations or notes on significant data points or trends?

  10. Do you want the lines to be smooth (curved) or straight (linear)?

  11. Is there a specific date or time format you would like for the x-axis?

  12. Would you like to see average trend lines or additional statistical information
  plotted on the chart?'
