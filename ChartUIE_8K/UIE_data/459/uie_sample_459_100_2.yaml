initial_prompt: '<start of user emulated instruction>

  Create a grouped bar chart to compare the water quality indicators (Pollution Index,
  Water Temp, Ammonia Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Dissolved Oxygen) over time. Highlight
  the Quantities of Exceed Standard to emphasize the periods when water quality failed
  to meet standards. Include text annotations for the highest and lowest values in
  each indicator category. The purpose is to track water quality trends in the LV-SW-012
  region. Ensure that missing values are accounted for and visually distinguish different
  water quality levels (Normal, IV).

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the grouped bar chart?

  2. How would you like the different water quality levels (Normal, IV) to be visually
  distinguished?

  3. Should the text annotations for the highest and lowest values be in a specific
  font or style?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines in the chart? If so, horizontal, vertical,
  or both?

  5. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the time axis (e.g., daily,
  monthly, yearly)?

  6. Are there any specific labels or titles you want for the chart axes and legend?

  7. Would you like the bars representing each water quality indicator to have specific
  patterns or textures?

  8. Should missing values be displayed in a certain way or omitted from the visualization?

  9. Do you have a preferred orientation for the bars (vertical or horizontal)?

  10. Is there a specific arrangement for the indicators on the chart that you prefer
  (e.g., Pollution Index first, etc.)?'
