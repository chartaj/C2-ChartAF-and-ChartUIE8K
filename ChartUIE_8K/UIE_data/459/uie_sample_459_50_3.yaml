initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the water quality parameters over time.
  Use "Time" as the x-axis and the different parameters (Pollution Index, Water Temp,
  Ammonia Nitrogen, Hosphorus, Dissolved Oxygen) as the y-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels or annotations for specific data points or ranges
  within the visualization?

  3. Do you prefer a specific format for the time axis (e.g., daily, hourly)?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color scale?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you would like to highlight within
  the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to display grid lines within the heatmap?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the heatmap?

  8. Should the heatmap include axis titles and if so, do you have any preferences
  for their wording?

  9. Do you want to include any trend lines or smoothing techniques to show general
  trends in the data?

  10. Are there any reference lines or markers you would like to include, such as
  average values or specific parameter thresholds?'
