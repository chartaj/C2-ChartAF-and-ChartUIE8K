initial_prompt: Visualize a geographic heatmap showing water quality levels across
  regions over time, highlighting areas with high pollution index. Add annotations
  on peak temperatures and ammonia nitrogen values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the geographic heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include a legend or color scale to interpret the pollution index
  values?

  3. Should the heatmap display data in a specific time interval (e.g., daily, weekly,
  monthly)?

  4. Do you have any preference for the style or format of annotations for peak temperatures
  and ammonia nitrogen values?

  5. Would you like to include specific geographic boundaries or labels in the heatmap?

  6. Are there any additional statistical markers or indicators you''d like to be
  included in the heatmap?'
