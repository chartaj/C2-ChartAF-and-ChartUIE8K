initial_prompt: 'Create a geographic heatmap illustrating water quality levels across
  regions, highlighting pollution indices. Use text annotations to display detailed
  metrics like Dissolved Oxygen(mg/L) and Ammonia Nitrogen(mg/L) for specific points,
  especially where they exceed standard limits. The map should accentuate regions
  with heightened pollution using distinct color gradations. Purpose: Identify and
  monitor pollution hotspots for effective environmental management. Include data
  points for Water Temp, Hosphorus(mg/L), and other relevant metrics. Aim to visually
  synthesize water quality trends over time to support environmental analysis and
  policy-making efforts.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap to highlight
  pollution indices?

  2. How would you prefer to categorize the color gradations to represent different
  levels of pollution?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the style or format of text annotations on the
  map?

  4. Should any thresholds for Dissolved Oxygen, Ammonia Nitrogen, and other metrics
  be explicitly labeled on the map?

  5. Is there a particular time range or segmentation (e.g., monthly, quarterly) you
  prefer for visualizing trends over time?

  6. Are there specific geographic boundaries or regions that need to be given special
  emphasis on the heatmap?

  7. Would you like to include any specific legends, labels, or descriptive text to
  assist the audience in interpreting the map?

  8. Is there a preferred map projection or geographic layout for displaying the regions?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would prefer clear and concise text annotations that are easily readable.

  4. Yes, please explicitly label thresholds for Dissolved Oxygen, Ammonia Nitrogen,
  and other critical metrics on the map.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, include legends and labels to help interpret the map.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.'
