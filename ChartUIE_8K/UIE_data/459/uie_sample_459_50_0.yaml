initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize 'Pollution Index' vs 'Dissolved
  Oxygen(mg/L)'. Highlight outlier points where 'Pollution Index' exceeds 50. Add
  text annotations for the first 5 points to show 'Time' and 'Water Temp'. Use contrasting
  colors for normal and outlier points.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for normal and outlier points?

  2. Would you like a specific shape for the outlier points?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for ''Time'' and ''Water Temp'' to be
  formatted (e.g., font size, font style, color)?

  4. Should the axes have specific labels or units displayed?

  5. Do you want the chart to include gridlines or a background color?

  6. Would you prefer any particular chart title or subtitle?

  7. Should the axis scales be logarithmic or linear?

  8. Do you require a legend to distinguish between normal and outlier points?

  9. Do you want any specific markers or lines (e.g., trend lines) added to the scatter
  plot?

  10. Is there any particular aspect ratio or size you would like the chart to be?'
