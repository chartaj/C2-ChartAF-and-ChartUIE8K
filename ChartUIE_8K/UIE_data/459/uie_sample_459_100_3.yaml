initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the water quality data from `459.csv`.
  The heatmap should display "Time" on the x-axis and "Ammonia Nitrogen(mg/L)", "Hosphorus(mg/L)",
  and "Dissolved Oxygen(mg/L)" on the y-axis. Use a color gradient to represent "Pollution
  Index" values, with higher pollution indices shown in darker shades. Ensure the
  heatmap provides a clear visual comparison of pollution levels at different times.
  This will help in understanding water quality variations over time in the specified
  region. Please align colors and scales appropriately for interpretability.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient or specific colors you would
  like to use for representing the "Pollution Index"?

  2. Is there a specific time interval you would like displayed on the x-axis (e.g.,
  hourly, daily)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font size or style for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should the y-axis display labels for each chemical separately or combined under
  a single category?

  5. Do you have any preference for the scale or range of Pollution Index values in
  the color gradient?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the heatmap for better readability?

  7. Should the color legend for the Pollution Index be placed at any specific location
  on the heatmap?

  8. Do you require any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap to highlight
  certain time periods or pollution levels?

  9. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?'
