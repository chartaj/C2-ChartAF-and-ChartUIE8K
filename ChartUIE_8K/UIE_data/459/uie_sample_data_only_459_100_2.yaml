  Create a grouped bar chart to compare the water quality indicators (Pollution Index,
  Water Temp, Ammonia Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Dissolved Oxygen) over time. Highlight
  the Quantities of Exceed Standard to emphasize the periods when water quality failed
  to meet standards. Include text annotations for the highest and lowest values in
  each indicator category. The purpose is to track water quality trends in the LV-SW-012
  region. Ensure that missing values are accounted for and visually distinguish different
  water quality levels (Normal, IV).
