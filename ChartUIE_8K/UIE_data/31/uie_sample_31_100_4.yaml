initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showing the distribution of churn among
  different payment methods used by customers. Use the provided Telco Customer Churn
  data for this visualization. The x-axis should represent the payment methods (Electronic
  check, Mailed check, Bank transfer, Credit card), and the y-axis should represent
  the count of customers in each category. Differentiate the bars based on whether
  the customer churned or not (Churn = Yes/No). This visualization will help us understand
  if there's any correlation between payment methods and churn rate.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating churn status
  (Yes/No) in the bars?

  2. Would you like to display the exact count of customers on top of each bar segment?

  3. Do you prefer a particular ordering of the payment methods on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis have a specific range or should it be automatically scaled
  based on the data?

  5. Do you want grid lines in the background to enhance readability? If so, should
  they be horizontal, vertical, or both?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  7. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Do you want any additional labels or annotations on the chart?'
