initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize browser market share data. Highlight
  browsers that have the highest and lowest shares. Annotate specific versions with
  their market shares. The purpose is to easily compare which browsers dominate and
  which have minimal presence. This will help understand browser popularity in the
  tech industry. Use colors and sizes to differentiate varying degrees of market share
  clearly. Add labels to show browser names and respective versions for a detailed
  view. Ensure the visualization captures the distribution and trends effectively
  to facilitate quick insights into browser usage patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting browsers
  with the highest and lowest shares?

  2. How would you like the sizes of the treemap sections to be scaled relative to
  market share values?

  3. Do you prefer any particular fonts or font sizes for the labels displaying browser
  names and versions?

  4. Should certain browsers or versions be emphasized differently in the treemap
  (e.g., bold fonts, larger sections)?

  5. Are there any specific color schemes you prefer for differentiating between varying
  degrees of market share?

  6. How detailed should the annotations be for each version (e.g., just market share
  percentage, additional descriptive text)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the treemap?

  8. Would you like specific market share thresholds to have distinct visual treatments
  (e.g., colors for ranges of market share)?'
