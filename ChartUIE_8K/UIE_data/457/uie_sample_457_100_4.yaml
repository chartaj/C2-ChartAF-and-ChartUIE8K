initial_prompt: I have some data about browser market share from the "computers-and-technology"
  sector. It includes information on different browsers, their versions, and corresponding
  usage data points. I'd like to create a column chart to visualize this information.
  Specifically, I want to compare the market share of each browser across different
  versions. The chart should have browsers listed on the X-axis and market share percentage
  on the Y-axis. Each browser should have multiple bars representing different versions.
  Please make the chart easy to read and visually appealing.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should each browser have a different color for its bars?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to distinguish between different browser versions?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included to make the chart easier to read?

  5. Do you prefer the bars to be clustered or stacked?

  6. Is there a specific order you want the browsers or versions to be displayed in?

  7. Do you wish to include data labels on each bar showing the exact market share
  percentage?

  8. Would you like to add axis titles and chart title? If yes, what should they be?

  9. Are there any specific font preferences for the text in the chart?

  10. Do you require any annotations or highlights on specific bars or data points?'
