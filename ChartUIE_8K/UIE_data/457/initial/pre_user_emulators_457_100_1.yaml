- Create a heatmap to visualize browser market share using the given data on browser,
  version, and data (usage percentage). Highlight browser versions with significant
  usage differences to draw attention to trends or outliers. Use text annotations
  to detail exact percentages for these highlighted versions to help understand market
  dominants and newcomers. The purpose of this visualization is to identify key market
  players and shifts in browser usage over time, within the computers-and-technology
  sector. This heatmap should make it easy for viewers to comprehend data at a glance
  and focus on important elements.
