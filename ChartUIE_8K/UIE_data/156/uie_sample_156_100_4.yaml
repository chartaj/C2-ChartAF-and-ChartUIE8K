initial_prompt: Please create a line chart that visualizes the trends of "Unemployment
  rate", "Inflation rate", and "GDP" over time. The x-axis should represent the data
  points in order, while the y-axis should show the respective values for each of
  the three indicators. This will help in understanding how these economic factors
  fluctuate in the dataset and their potential impact on student dropouts and success
  rates. The chart should include distinct lines for each indicator and a legend to
  differentiate them. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Should the time intervals on the x-axis be labeled in a specific way (e.g., yearly,
  quarterly)?

  3. Do you require data point markers on the lines?

  4. Do you need grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Should there be any reference lines or annotations highlighting key points in
  the data?

  6. Is there a preferred style or font for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Do you need the y-axis to be on a specific scale (e.g., logarithmic)?

  8. Is there a specific title you''d like for the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any specific notes or footnotes on the chart explaining
  certain data points or trends?

  10. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. Yearly intervals would be great, but I am not sure.

  3. I do not know if data point markers are necessary.

  4. Yes, grid lines on the chart would improve readability.

  5. I am not sure about reference lines or annotations.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the style or font for the labels and
  legend.

  7. I am not sure about using a specific scale for the y-axis.

  8. You can title the chart "Trends of Economic Indicators Over Time".

  9. I do not know if specific notes or footnotes are needed.

  10. I am not sure where the legend should be placed.'
