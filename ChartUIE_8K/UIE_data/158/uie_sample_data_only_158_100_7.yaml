02_initial_prompt: I need a box chart to visualize the distribution of StudyHoursPerWeek
  and GPA based on different Genders and Majors from the Student Performance Dataset.
  This will help understand how study hours and GPA vary among male and female students
  in different majors. Additionally, please include outliers in the box chart to identify
  any extreme values. The box chart should be easy to interpret with clear labels,
  a legend, and appropriate titles for each axis and the chart itself. Thanks!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
