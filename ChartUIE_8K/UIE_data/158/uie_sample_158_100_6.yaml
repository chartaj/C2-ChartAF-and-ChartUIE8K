initial_prompt: I am doing a project on student performance and want a bar chart to
  visualize the data. Specifically, I would like a chart that shows the average GPA
  for each major. The x-axis should have the different majors and the y-axis should
  display the average GPA. Additionally, can you also show the average attendance
  rate for each major in the same chart? This will help me compare both GPA and attendance
  rates across different fields of study. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  GPA and attendance rate?

  2. Would you like the bars representing GPA and attendance rate to be side-by-side
  or stacked?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on the bars to show the exact values?

  4. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reference, and if so, in which
  direction (horizontal, vertical, or both)?

  5. Is there a specific range or scale you want for the y-axis?

  6. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  7. Would you like any annotations or notes to be included on the chart for clarity?

  8. Should there be a legend to distinguish between GPA and attendance rate bars?

  9. Do you have a preference for the width of the bars on the chart?

  10. Would you like to include any additional elements such as a trend line or average
  line?'
