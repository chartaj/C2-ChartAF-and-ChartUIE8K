initial_prompt: Create a grouped column chart to visualize student performance based
  on their major. Use the GPA, study hours per week, and attendance rate as the metrics
  for comparison. Highlight the differences between genders and mark those with part-time
  jobs. Provide annotations to highlight standout cases, such as exceptionally high
  or low GPA, or outliers in study hours. Include some contextual annotations to offer
  insights into how extracurricular activities might be impacting these metrics. This
  will help to quickly grasp trends and pinpoint areas where interventions might be
  needed to improve overall student performance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for representing different
  metrics and categories?

  2. How would you like to differentiate between genders in the chart (e.g., color
  coding, pattern, etc.)?

  3. Do you prefer specific shapes or markers to indicate part-time job status on
  the chart?

  4. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the annotations
  and labels?

  5. How detailed should the contextual annotations be regarding extracurricular activities''
  impact on metrics?

  6. Should the standout cases be highlighted with specific colors, shapes, or any
  other visual cues?

  7. Do you have preferences on the chart layout, such as the order of metrics (GPA,
  study hours, attendance rate) or how they are grouped?

  8. Would you like a legend to explain the visual encodings used for different attributes
  (gender, part-time job status, etc.)?

  9. Is there a specific orientation or aspect ratio you prefer for the grouped column
  chart?

  10. Do you have a preference for how to present outliers, such as using different
  colors or special symbols?'
