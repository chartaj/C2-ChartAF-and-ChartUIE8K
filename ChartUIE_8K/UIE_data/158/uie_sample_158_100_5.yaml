initial_prompt: I want to see a histogram for the "StudyHoursPerWeek" column in the
  Student Performance Dataset. I am curious to understand the distribution of the
  number of hours students spend on their studies per week. This will help me identify
  any patterns or outliers in study habits among different students. Please make sure
  the histogram includes relevant labels and a proper title for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the histogram?

  2. Do you prefer specific labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like to set specific bin widths or prefer automatic binning?

  4. Are there any specific color preferences for the bars in the histogram?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier readability?

  6. Would you like to include any annotations for notable patterns or outliers?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  8. Would you like to add a legend, or is it unnecessary for this histogram?

  9. Do you prefer a standard aspect ratio, or do you have a custom size in mind for
  the chart?'
