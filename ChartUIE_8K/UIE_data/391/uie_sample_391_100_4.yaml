initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart showcasing the followers of influencers from
  the influencer network in the media and communications sector. The X-axis should
  represent the names of the influencers, and the Y-axis should represent the number
  of followers they have. Please differentiate the bars based on the groups they belong
  to (e.g., Tech, Music). This chart will help visualize the distribution of followers
  among different groups. Additionally, make sure to handle the missing values in
  the dataset appropriately, perhaps by ignoring or filling them with a suitable value.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the groups?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed in ascending or descending order based
  on follower count?

  3. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact follower count for each
  influencer?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to identify the different groups?

  5. How would you like missing values to be handled: ignored or filled with a certain
  value?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart''s text elements (e.g.,
  axis labels, title)?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Should gridlines be displayed on the chart? If yes, would you like both horizontal
  and vertical gridlines?

  9. Do you prefer the chart to have any specific margin or padding settings?

  10. Is there any specific format or alignment you prefer for the axis labels?'
