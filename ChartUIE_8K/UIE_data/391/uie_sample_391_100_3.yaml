initial_prompt: I want to visualize the influencer network data using a Treemap. The
  tree should be organized by the 'group' column, and within each group, the size
  of the rectangles should represent the 'followers' count. Each rectangle should
  be labeled with the 'name' of the influencer. If possible, color-code the groups
  to differentiate them easily. Since this is related to media and communications,
  I want the Treemap to highlight the differences in follower counts clearly and show
  how influencers are grouped.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different groups?

  2. Would you like a border or a specific edging style for each rectangle in the
  Treemap?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you''d prefer for the influencer names
  within the rectangles?

  4. Do you want to display the follower counts on the rectangles alongside the influencer
  names?

  5. Should we use a specific padding or spacing between rectangles in the Treemap?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the Treemap?

  7. Do you want a legend included to explain the color-coding of the groups?

  8. Would you like any particular sorting order for the rectangles within each group
  based on follower count?'
