- Please create a network diagram visualizing the influencer network in the media
  and communications sector. Highlight nodes based on their follower counts, with
  the size or color of nodes indicating the number of followers. For key influencers
  with unique characteristics, such as those from different groups or having an exceptionally
  high follower count, add text annotations. These annotations should emphasize their
  importance within the network. This chart is to help identify influential individuals
  and their connections within the industry, providing insight into how information
  and influence flow among these figures.
