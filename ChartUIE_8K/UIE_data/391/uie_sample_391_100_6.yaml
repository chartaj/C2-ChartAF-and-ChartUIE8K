initial_prompt: I have data about influencers in the Tech and Music groups. I want
  a network graph where nodes represent influencers and edges represent connections
  between them. The node size should reflect the number of followers, and different
  colors for group differentiation. The relationships are via followers count and
  groups. Make sure missing values are handled properly. This is for visualizing an
  influencer network in the media and communications field. Example influencers are
  Alice from Tech with 1M followers and Charlie from Music with 2M followers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the groups
  (Tech and Music)?

  2. How would you like to handle missing values in the data (e.g., imputation, removal)?

  3. Do you have specific size ranges in mind for the nodes representing the number
  of followers?

  4. Are there any specific layout algorithms you prefer for the network graph (e.g.,
  force-directed, circular)?

  5. Do you have any specific label display preferences for the influencer nodes (e.g.,
  showing names, follower counts)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to identify group colors and follower size
  significance?

  7. Should we include any filtering options, such as showing only influencers with
  a certain minimum number of followers?

  8. Are there specific design styles or themes you prefer for the overall aesthetic
  of the network graph?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette.

  2. I am not sure about handling missing values.

  3. No specific size ranges in mind.

  4. I do not know about layout algorithms.

  5. Please show names and follower counts for the influencer nodes.

  6. Yes, include a legend to identify group colors and follower size significance.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for filtering options.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for design styles or themes.'
