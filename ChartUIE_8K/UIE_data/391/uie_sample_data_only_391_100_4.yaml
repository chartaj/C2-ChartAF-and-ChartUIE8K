02_initial_prompt: I would like a bar chart showcasing the followers of influencers
  from the influencer network in the media and communications sector. The X-axis should
  represent the names of the influencers, and the Y-axis should represent the number
  of followers they have. Please differentiate the bars based on the groups they belong
  to (e.g., Tech, Music). This chart will help visualize the distribution of followers
  among different groups. Additionally, make sure to handle the missing values in
  the dataset appropriately, perhaps by ignoring or filling them with a suitable value.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
