initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap of the Bakery Sales Dataset. I'd like the
  heatmap to visualize the frequency of different items sold at various times of the
  day, broken down by day part (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening) and distinguishing
  between weekday and weekend sales. This should help me understand trends in customer
  purchasing behavior over different times and days. Make sure to include clear labels
  and a color scale to show intensity.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to be segmented by specific time intervals within
  each day part?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color intensity?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want included in the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to see separate heatmaps for weekdays and weekends, or combined
  into one heatmap?

  6. Is there a specific range of dates you are particularly interested in analyzing?

  7. Would you prefer any specific ordering of items or day parts in the heatmap?

  8. Do you have a preferred format for the labels on the axes (e.g., full date, abbreviated
  day names)?

  9. Should the heatmap display absolute frequencies or normalized values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, I want the heatmap to include a legend explaining the color intensity.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure, maybe combined into one heatmap.

  8. I prefer abbreviated day names.

  9. Absolute frequencies would be fine.'
