initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the bakery sales data over time.
  Use the DateTime column for the x-axis and the number of Transactions for the y-axis.
  Highlight the weekends to show their impact on sales. Annotate high sales points
  to emphasize busy periods. The goal is to identify trends and patterns in sales
  across different days and dayparts. This will help understand customer behavior
  and optimize business strategy. Make sure to differentiate weekdays from weekends
  with distinct colors and include relevant text annotations for notable data points.
  Focus on making the data easy to interpret for business insights.
questions: '1. Do you have preferred colors for differentiating weekdays from weekends?

  2. Do you have any specific formatting preferences for the text annotations on high
  sales points?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to explain the different colors used?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded on the chart background?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  6. Is there a specific time format you prefer for the DateTime axis (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD,
  MM/DD/YYYY)?

  7. Should the line chart include data markers at each data point, or do you prefer
  a smooth line without markers?

  8. Do you want any specific thresholds or reference lines to be included in the
  chart (e.g., average sales line)?

  9. Are there any specific high sales periods you already know of that should be
  pre-annotated on the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the annotations to be placed directly on the chart or in a
  separate legend?'
