  occasional dips? (e.g., text labels, icons)

  5. Are there any specific date or time formats you would like on the x-axis?

  6. Do you prefer a particular line style for the sales trend (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  7. How detailed do you want the y-axis to be in terms of sales values (e.g., every
  10, every 100)?

  8. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  9. Should the chart include markers on data points, especially for peak sales and
  dips?
