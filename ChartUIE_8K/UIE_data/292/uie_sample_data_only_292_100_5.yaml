  I need a scatter plot to visualize the Bakery Sales Dataset. Each point should represent
  a transaction, plotting ''DateTime'' on the x-axis to indicate the time of purchase,
  and ''TransactionNo'' on the y-axis to represent individual transactions. Use different
  colors or markers to distinguish between ''Daypart'' (Morning, Afternoon, etc.)
  and ''DayType'' (Weekend, Weekday). This will help in understanding the time patterns
  of bakery sales throughout the day and identifying peak times or trends relevant
  to different days. Make sure the scatter plot is clear and labels are readable.
