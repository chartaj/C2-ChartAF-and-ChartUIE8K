02_initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart for the bakery sales dataset. Each
  column should represent a unique day part (e.g., Morning, Afternoon, etc.), and
  the columns should be stacked to show different items sold during these times. Use
  colors to distinguish between different items. Ensure the x-axis represents the
  different Dayparts and the y-axis represents the number of transactions. Additionally,
  differentiate between DayType (Weekday vs. Weekend) using different shades or patterns
