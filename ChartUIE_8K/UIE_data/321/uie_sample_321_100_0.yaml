initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize IBM stock data, showing correlations
  between Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Annotate specific values that stand
  out, such as unusually high or low prices, to focus attention on key data points.
  Use highlights to change the color of these annotations for emphasis. This will
  help in understanding trends and identifying significant events in IBM's stock history.
  Labels should provide context for the data points, explaining why they are significant.
  The overall purpose is to make it easy to identify patterns and anomalies in the
  stock's performance over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to use a gradient scale or discrete color bands?

  3. How would you prefer the annotations to be styled (e.g., font type, size, and
  color)?

  4. Are there specific date ranges or time periods you want to highlight in the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preference for the layout of the heatmap (e.g., aspect ratio, size)?

  6. Should specific thresholds be set for what constitutes ''unusually high'' or
  ''unusually low'' prices?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the format of the labels providing context for
  significant data points?

  8. Would you like to include any additional statistical metrics or summaries in
  the visualization?

  9. Are there particular patterns or trends you are especially interested in observing?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. A gradient scale would be good.

  3. I am not sure about the styling; something easily readable would be fine.

  4. I do not know. Maybe a broad range?

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, it would be helpful to set specific thresholds for unusually high or low
  prices.

  7. I am not sure; just make the labels clear and informative.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am especially interested in observing any sudden spikes or drops in prices.'
