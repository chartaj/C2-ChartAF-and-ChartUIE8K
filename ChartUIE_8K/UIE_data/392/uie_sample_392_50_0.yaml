initial_prompt: Create a Sankey diagram illustrating energy flow from various sources
  such as Coal, NaturalGas, and Nuclear to different sectors. Emphasize key data points
  and flows using annotations and highlights to draw attention.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for the different energy sources
  and sectors?

  2. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the Sankey diagram (e.g.,
  left-to-right, top-to-bottom)?

  3. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want to include for key data
  points and flows?

  4. Are there any thresholds or values that should be highlighted with specific visual
  features (e.g., larger flows, different colors)?

  5. Do you have preferences for the font style and size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Should the diagram include a legend to explain the colors and symbols used?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the thickness or width of the flow lines?

  8. Are there any constraints on the size or dimensions of the final diagram?

  9. Should the flows be proportional to the value they represent, or do you have
  another preference?

  10. Would you like the nodes (energy sources and sectors) to have specific shapes
  or designs?'
