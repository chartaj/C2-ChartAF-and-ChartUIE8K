  Data attributes MUST match exactly the column names of the data.

  Store the selected task from the task types in query[''Task''].

  Store the purpose of visualization in query[''Purpose''].

  Store the prospective audience in query[''Audience''].

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the network graph?

  2. Would you like the nodes to be differentiated by size based on the value attribute?

  3. Do you want specific shapes for different types of energy sources and sectors?

  4. How would you like the critical energy connections to be annotated (e.g., text
  labels, color coding)?

  5. Should there be a legend to explain the annotations and color schemes used?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations on
  nodes and links?

  7. Do you have any preference on the layout style of the network graph (e.g., radial,
  hierarchical, force-directed)?

  8. Would you prefer the network graph to emphasize more on the sources or the sectors,
  or should both be given equal importance?

  9. How detailed should the annotations be for critical connections (e.g., exact
  values, percentage of total energy flow)?

  10. Do you need any specific labels or titles on the axes or the graph as a whole?'
