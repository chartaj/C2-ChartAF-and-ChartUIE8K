initial_prompt: Create a network graph showing energy flow from sources like Coal,
  NaturalGas, and Nuclear to different sectors. Annotate specific nodes and links
  with essential data values to highlight critical energy connections.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the network graph?

  2. Would you like the nodes to be differentiated by size based on the value attribute?

  3. Do you want specific shapes for different types of energy sources and sectors?

  4. How would you like the critical energy connections to be annotated (e.g., text
  labels, color coding)?

  5. Should there be a legend to explain the annotations and color schemes used?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations on
  nodes and links?

  7. Do you have any preference on the layout style of the network graph (e.g., radial,
  hierarchical, force-directed)?

  8. Would you prefer the network graph to emphasize more on the sources or the sectors,
  or should both be given equal importance?

  9. How detailed should the annotations be for critical connections (e.g., exact
  values, percentage of total energy flow)?

  10. Do you need any specific labels or titles on the axes or the graph as a whole?'
