initial_prompt: Create a line chart displaying changes in the "Age" and "Weight" columns
  from the data. Highlight significant trends or changes over time, particularly noting
  points with annotations where weight changes drastically. Annotations will help
  highlight these specific data points for better understanding. This visualization
  aims to explore relationships in health metrics over time and family history influence
  on obesity levels. Make sure to use appropriate colors to distinguish different
  trends effectively. This will help identify correlations and patterns related to
  obesity levels for improved health analysis and awareness.
