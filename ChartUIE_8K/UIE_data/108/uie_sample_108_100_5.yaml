initial_prompt: I need a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between different
  attributes related to obesity levels sourced from the given dataset. The data includes
  various health parameters like Age, Gender, Height, Weight, frequency of water consumption
  (CH2O), family history with overweight, and others. Please generate a correlation
  matrix heatmap showcasing how each of these variables relate to each other, especially
  focusing on their relationship to the obesity level categories (NObeyesdad). It
  should provide insights into which factors are most strongly associated with obesity
  levels. Use distinct colors to indicate varying levels of correlation.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for indicating varying levels of correlation?

  2. Do you want to include labels for correlation coefficients within the heatmap
  cells?

  3. Should the heatmap have a specific order for attributes (e.g., alphabetical,
  by correlation strength)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for labels and titles?

  5. Are there any specific attributes you want to prioritize or highlight in the
  heatmap?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the heatmap?

  7. Should the axes be labeled with full attribute names or abbreviations?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include labels for correlation coefficients within the heatmap
  cells.

  3. By correlation strength would be preferred.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Weight, Height, Age, and NObeyesdad should be prioritized.

  6. "Correlation Matrix of Health Parameters and Obesity Levels"

  7. Full attribute names, please.'
