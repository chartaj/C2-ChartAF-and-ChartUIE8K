initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'Age' compared
  to 'Gender' and the corresponding 'NObeyesdad' categories. Highlight outliers and
  specific data points to emphasize variations in age across different obesity levels.
  Use text annotations to denote values for median ages and significant outliers.
  Ensure the chart contrasts 'Height' and 'Weight' observations across genders, emphasizing
  on 'Normal_Weight' classifications. This visualization should provide insights into
  how age and obesity levels correlate, offering a clear comparative view of obesity
  trends based on gender and age factors. Utilize the given data types and sample
  for illustration.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart to highlight different
  ''Gender'' and ''NObeyesdad'' categories?

  2. Is there a specific style you prefer for text annotations (e.g., font type, size,
  color)?

  3. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted (e.g., different color, symbol)?

  4. Do you want to include a legend for ''Height'' and ''Weight'' observations? If
  so, where should the legend be placed?

  5. How do you want the axes to be labeled (e.g., any particular format for ''Age''
  or ''Weight'')?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability of data points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Different color symbols for outliers would be fine.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I would like clear and straightforward labels for ''Age'' and ''Weight''.

  6. Yes, including gridlines for better readability of data points would be great.'
