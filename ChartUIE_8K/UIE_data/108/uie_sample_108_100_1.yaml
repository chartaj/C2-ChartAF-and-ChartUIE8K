initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the data on obesity levels.
  Ensure to display Age, Gender, Height, Weight, CALC, FAVC, and FAFC as different
  segments to show their contribution to NObeyesdad outcomes. Highlight specific elements
  to emphasize trends, especially focusing on family history with overweight and physical
  activity factors. Annotations should provide insight into notable categories, such
  as high frequency of physical activity and its correlation with Normal Weight. The
  practical purpose is to identify patterns in obesity related to these personal and
  lifestyle factors, aiding in health assessment and planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for different segments (Age, Gender,
  Height, Weight, CALC, FAVC, and FAF) in the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you prefer us to highlight specific elements such as family history
  with overweight and physical activity factors?

  3. Would you like to include a legend to explain the segments, and if so, do you
  have any specific preferences for its placement?

  4. Are there any specific categories or ranges for the data attributes that you
  want to be annotated with insights?

  5. Should the annotations be displayed on the bars themselves, or would you prefer

  6. Do you want to include any specific titles or labels for the axes and chart?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size that you would prefer for the annotations
  and chart labels?

  8. Would you like to incorporate any gridlines or background elements to enhance
  readability?

  9. How would you like us to sort the data in the chart (e.g., by Age, Gender, NObeyesdad
  outcomes)?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to be presented in a horizontal or vertical orientation?'
