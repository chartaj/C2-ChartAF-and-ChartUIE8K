initial_prompt: I would like a line chart visualizing the correlation between Temperature
  and Entanglement Level over different Q-States. The x-axis should represent the
  Q-States, and the y-axis should show the Temperature and Entanglement Level values
  on dual vertical axes. Color-code the lines for Temperature and Entanglement Level
  for easy differentiation. Additionally, please highlight any significant peaks or
  valleys. This visualization will help in understanding how temperature variations
  might affect entanglement levels in the context of Quantum Decision-Making under
  different conditions. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  Temperature and Entanglement Level?

  2. Would you like to set any custom range or limits for the y-axes representing
  Temperature and Entanglement Level?

  3. Do you want any particular style for highlighting significant peaks or valleys
  (e.g., markers, annotations, different color)?

  4. Is there a specific format or precision for the data values on the y-axes that
  you prefer?

  5. Do you have any preference for the gridlines or background of the chart to enhance
  readability?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or labels on the chart? If so, do you have
  a specific format for these?

  7. Do you require any titles or subtitles for the chart to contextualize the data?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the custom range or limits for the y-axes.

  3. Markers would be fine for highlighting significant peaks or valleys.

  4. I do not know; I do not have a specific format or precision in mind.

  5. I am not sure about the gridlines or background preferences.

  6. Yes, including legends or labels would be helpful. No specific format required.

  7. Yes, please include a title like "Correlation between Temperature and Entanglement
  Level over Q-States" and a subtitle explaining the context of Quantum Decision-Making
  under different conditions.'
