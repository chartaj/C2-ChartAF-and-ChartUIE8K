initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing "Entanglement Level" and "Probability of
  Outcome" for different "Q-States". Highlight bars for "Decision Superposition" of
  1 to emphasize. Add text annotations for all "Outcome". Focus is on quantum decision-making
  insights.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bars representing
  different "Q-States"?

  2. How would you like the highlighted bars for "Decision Superposition" of 1 to
  be visually distinguished (e.g., color, pattern, etc.)?

  3. Where would you prefer the text annotations for "Outcome" to be placed (e.g.,
  above the bars, inside the bars, etc.)?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles? If so, what should
  they be?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?
  If yes, should they be major, minor, or both?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal)?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the bar chart?

  9. Would you like a legend to be included, particularly for distinguishing between
  different "Q-States" and highlighting the "Decision Superposition"?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or additional details you want to include
  in the chart for better clarity or insight?'
