initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart showcasing the quantum decision-making
  data. Highlight temperature, pressure, and entanglement level columns. Add annotations
  to emphasize unique patterns or outliers in these specific variables.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlighted data
  attributes (Temperature, Pressure, Entanglement Level)?

  2. Would you prefer a specific color scheme or palette for the overall chart?

  3. Are there any specific labeling requirements for the annotations, such as text
  size or font style?

  4. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) or thickness?

  5. Should any specific ranges or thresholds be marked or emphasized in the chart?

  6. How would you like outliers to be visually represented (e.g., different color,
  symbols)?

  7. Do you need specific titles for the axes or any special formatting for the axis
  labels?

  8. Would you prefer a particular background color or grid line style for the chart?

  9. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be placed?'
