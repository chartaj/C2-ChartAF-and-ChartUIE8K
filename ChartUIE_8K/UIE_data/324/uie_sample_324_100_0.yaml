  Create a heatmap to visualize the relationships within the Quantum Decision-Making
  dataset. Highlight areas with high entanglement levels and probabilities of outcomes.
  Add annotations to specific data points where the external observers'' count is
  high and decision superposition occurs. This will help to identify key patterns
  and anomalies relevant to quantum physics research. Ensure the axes accurately represent
  the measurements, such as temperature and pressure, with appropriate scales. This
  visualization aims to facilitate understanding of how different variables affect
  quantum states and decision outcomes.

questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap include a gradient legend for entanglement levels and probabilities
  of outcomes?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style or size used in annotations?

  4. Would you like a specific annotation format or marker style for data points where
  external observers'' count is high and decision superposition occurs?

  5. Is there a particular way you would like the axes labeled or formatted?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the heatmap, and if so, any preference on their appearance?

  7. Should the scales for temperature and pressure be linear or logarithmic?

  8. Do you want a title or specific caption for the heatmap?

  9. Are there any additional notes or footnotes that need to be included in the visualization?

  10. Do you have preferences for the background color or overall design theme of
  the heatmap?'
