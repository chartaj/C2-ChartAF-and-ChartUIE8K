initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize how Temperature and Pressure vary
  across different Q-States in a quantum decision-making process.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the lines for Temperature and Pressure to be distinctly styled
  (e.g., dashed vs. solid)?

  3. Should the line chart include data markers for each Q-State?

  4. Do you want grid lines in the background for easier reading of values?

  5. Do you prefer a specific type of legend placement (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Should the axes be labeled with specific titles or units?

  7. Are there any specific axis scaling requirements (e.g., logarithmic vs. linear)?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or highlights for certain Q-States?

  9. Should there be a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  10. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used in the chart?'
