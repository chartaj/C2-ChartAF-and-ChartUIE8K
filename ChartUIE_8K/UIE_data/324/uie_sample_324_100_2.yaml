initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize how Q-State, Temperature,
  Pressure, External Observers, Entanglement Level, Probability of Outcome, Decision
  Superposition, and Outcome interact in quantum decision-making scenarios. Highlight
  the Entanglement Level and Probability of Outcome columns to emphasize their variations.
  Annotate notable patterns or outliers, especially when decision superposition is
  high. This visualization will help understand the relationships and distributions
  across multiple factors in experimental quantum physics, aiding deeper insights
  into decision-making dynamics under varying conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  2. Would you like to use specific line styles or thicknesses to differentiate between
  various attributes?

  3. Do you want to include a legend to explain the highlighted columns (Entanglement
  Level and Probability of Outcome)?

  4. How would you prefer the annotations for notable patterns or outliers to be displayed
  (e.g., text labels, arrows)?

  5. Is there a specific order in which youâ€™d like the attributes to be displayed
  on the parallel coordinates chart?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds for the highlighted attributes that
  need to be emphasized?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the background style (e.g., plain, grid, shaded)?

  8. Should the chart include interactive elements such as hover-over tooltips for
  additional information?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to explain the highlighted columns.

  4. Text labels would be preferred for the annotations.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific preference for the background style.

  8. I have no specific preference, but considering I want an image, interactive elements
  are not necessary.'
