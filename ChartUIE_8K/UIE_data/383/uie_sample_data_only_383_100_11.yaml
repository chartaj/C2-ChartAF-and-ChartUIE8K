  phrases like "Almost Certainly," "Highly Likely," etc. Each phrase has corresponding
  numerical ratings. I want a grouped bar chart comparing these phrases across multiple
  instances of feedback. Each bar group will represent a specific phrase, and each
  bar within the group will denote different instances of feedback. The y-axis should
  display the numerical ratings, while the x-axis lists all the phrases. Colors should

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
