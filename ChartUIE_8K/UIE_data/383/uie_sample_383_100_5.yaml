initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize how people evaluate service in
  a business. Use the columns representing different probabilities (e.g., "Almost
  Certainly," "Highly Likely," etc.) for the bubble sizes. The x-axis will be the
  categories (Column labels), and the y-axis will be the sample data values. Each
  category should have its own bubble whose size is proportional to the given values.
  This will help identify trends in customer evaluations, with larger bubbles indicating
  higher probabilities and better service evaluation. This is important for understanding
  customer satisfaction levels in our business context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bubbles?

  2. Are there any particular categories you would like to highlight or differentiate
  in the chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for displaying the categories on the x-axis?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the bubbles to show the exact values?

  5. Do you prefer a specific range or scale for the y-axis values?

  6. Are there any specific titles or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Should the chart include a legend to explain the bubble sizes and colors?

  9. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  10. Are there any specific bubble size ranges you would like to set for better differentiation?'
