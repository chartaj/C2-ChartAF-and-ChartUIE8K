initial_prompt: I want a scatter plot that visualizes how people evaluate services
  in the business sector, using the given data columns. Plot 'Almost Certainly' on
  the x-axis and 'We Doubt' on the y-axis. Each point in the scatter plot should represent
  a single data entry from the sample data. Ensure to add appropriate labels, a title,
  and a legend if necessary, to clearly illustrate the data points as they relate
  to service evaluation probabilities. This will help in understanding the correlation
  between high certainty and doubt levels in service evaluations.
