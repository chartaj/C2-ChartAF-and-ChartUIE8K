02_initial_prompt: I would like a Treemap chart to visualize how people evaluate service
  for a business. Use the columns to show different evaluation terms like "Almost
  Certainly", "Highly Likely", etc., with their corresponding values. Include all
  unique values as separate sections in the Treemap and color-code them based on their
  value frequency or data type if possible. This visual should provide a clear comparison
  of how often each evaluation term is used and its distribution. Make sure the sizes
  of the sections are proportional to their data, and provide labels for easy understanding.
  Thanks!

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.
