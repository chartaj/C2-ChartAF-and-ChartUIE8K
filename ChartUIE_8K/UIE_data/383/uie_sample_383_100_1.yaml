initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart that visualizes how people evaluate service
  in a business context. The chart should include the columns with the labels such
  as "Almost Certainly," "Highly Likely," and others down to "Chances Are Slight."
  Use the "Unique Values" data as the values for each category to show their distribution.
  Add text annotations to highlight key areas, such as "Almost Certainly" and "Highly
  Likely," to draw attention to the higher evaluation scores. Additionally, use highlights
  like different colors to distinguish categories clearly. This will help in understanding
  the evaluation distribution visually.

  in the donut chart?
