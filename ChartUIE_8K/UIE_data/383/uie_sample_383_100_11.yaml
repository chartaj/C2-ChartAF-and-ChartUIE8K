initial_prompt: I have customer feedback data for a business, represented by different
  phrases like "Almost Certainly," "Highly Likely," etc. Each phrase has corresponding
  numerical ratings. I want a grouped bar chart comparing these phrases across multiple
  instances of feedback. Each bar group will represent a specific phrase, and each
  bar within the group will denote different instances of feedback. The y-axis should
  display the numerical ratings, while the x-axis lists all the phrases. Colors should
  differentiate the instances. This chart will help visualize customer perception
  over different feedback instances.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the feedback
  instances?

  2. Should the chart include a legend to explain the colors of different instances?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart for easier reading of the values?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have labels on each bar indicating the numerical rating?

  5. Should the chart have a title? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you want to include axis titles? If yes, do you have specific names for the
  x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Would you like tooltips to appear when hovering over each bar to show more detailed
  information?

  8. Should the chart include a background color, or should it be transparent?

  9. Do you have a specific order for the phrases on the x-axis or should they be
  automatically sorted?

  10. Would you like to add any custom annotations or markers to highlight specific
  data points?'
