initial_prompt: I want to visualize how people evaluate service business using a stacked
  bar chart. The chart should display different probability columns like 'Almost Certainly',
  'Highly Likely', 'Very Good Chance', etc., along the x-axis. Each bar should be
  divided into stacks representing the unique values for those probabilities. For
  clarity, include text annotations to highlight key values or trends and highlights
  to emphasize significant columns or values. This visualization will help us understand
  the varying degrees of certainty people have in evaluating service businesses. Focus
  on readability and easy comparison of different probabilities.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the stacks representing
  unique values?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to have a specific theme or style?

  3. Are there particular columns or values you want to be highlighted more prominently?

  4. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color coding of the stacks?

  5. How detailed do you want the text annotations to be?

  6. Are there any particular trends or key values you want the annotations to focus
  on?

  7. Would you like the bars to be sorted in a specific order?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style and size for text annotations and labels?

  9. Are there any specific axis labels or titles you would like to include in the
  chart?

  10. Do you want gridlines to be present or absent in the chart for better readability?'
