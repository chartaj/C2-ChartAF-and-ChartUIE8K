initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize how people evaluate service
  quality in a business context. Use the columns from the data provided, such as 'Almost
  Certainly', 'Highly Likely', 'Very Good Chance', etc. Plot these columns on the
  y-axis and the corresponding values on the x-axis. This will help to see the trend
  and differences in service evaluation from 'Almost Certainly' to 'Chances Are Slight'.
  Make sure each column is represented by a different line on the same chart for easy
  comparison. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the lines representing each column?

  2. Would you prefer to have gridlines on the chart for easier comparison and readability?

  3. Should we include any specific labels or markers on the line chart for highlighting
  certain data points?

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate each line based on the columns?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the chart include a title, and if so, what should the title be?

  8. Do you have any preference for the range or intervals of the values on the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  9. Would you like to include data point markers along the lines, or should the lines
  be smooth?'
