initial_prompt: I would like a Treemap chart to visualize how people evaluate service
  for a business. Use the columns to show different evaluation terms like "Almost
  Certainly", "Highly Likely", etc., with their corresponding values. Include all
  unique values as separate sections in the Treemap and color-code them based on their
  value frequency or data type if possible. This visual should provide a clear comparison
  of how often each evaluation term is used and its distribution. Make sure the sizes
  of the sections are proportional to their data, and provide labels for easy understanding.
  Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the Treemap?

  2. Should the colors be gradient based on frequency or distinct for each category?

  3. Do you have preferences for the font style or size for the labels?

  4. Would you like to include any specific legend or key for interpreting the colors
  and sizes?

  5. Should the Treemap include tooltips with additional information on hover?

  6. Are there any specific label formatting preferences (e.g., bold, italic)?

  7. Do you want the sections to be organized in a particular order (e.g., alphabetically,
  by size)?

  8. Is there any specific styling preference for the borders of the sections?'
