initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize how people evaluate service in a business
  context. The chart should include categories like "Almost Certainly" to "Chances
  Are Slight" on the x-axis, with values on the y-axis. It should emphasize key data
  points with text annotations, such as highest and lowest probabilities. Highlights
  should be used to differentiate between higher and lower likelihoods. The visualization
  aims to clearly show how customers perceive service quality and the distribution
  of their probability evaluations. This will help in assessing areas that need improvement
  based on customer feedback.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlights to indicate
  higher and lower likelihoods?

  2. Would you prefer the annotations for highest and lowest probabilities to be displayed
  as text within the bars or above the bars?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or sizes you would like for the text annotations?

  4. Do you need gridlines in the bar chart? If yes, how prominent should they be?

  5. Would you like to include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  text for them?

  6. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical bar chart?

  7. Should the bars be a specific width or spaced in a certain way for better readability?

  8. Are there any particular styles or themes you would like the chart to follow
  (e.g., modern, classic, minimalistic)?

  9. Would you like to incorporate any additional visual elements, such as legends
  or footnotes, to provide context?

  10. Should the chart include a border or defined edges around the bars for emphasis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer the annotations for highest and lowest probabilities to be displayed
  above the bars.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, gridlines would be helpful. They should be subtle but visible.

  5. Yes, a title and axis labels would be good. Title: "Customer Service Evaluation".
  X-axis: "Evaluation Categories", Y-axis: "Frequency".

  6. I prefer a vertical bar chart.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
