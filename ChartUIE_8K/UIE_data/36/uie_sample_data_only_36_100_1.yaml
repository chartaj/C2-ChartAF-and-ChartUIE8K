09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the level of color intensity granularity for price differences.

  3. I would like annotations for high-price areas to mention the neighborhood names
  and median prices.

  4. I do not know, maybe just different color shades or intensity?

  5. Street view would be fine.

  6. The timeframe should cover the last 5 years.

  7. Emphasize the total number of houses sold and the average price, bedrooms, and
  bathrooms in the dataset.'
