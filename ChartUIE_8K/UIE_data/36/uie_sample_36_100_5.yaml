initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the number of houses sold
  with various bedroom and bathroom combinations in King County. Each bar should represent
  a different number of bedrooms (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4+), and within each bar, different
  segments should stack up to show the count for various bathroom counts (e.g., 1,
  1.5, 2, 2.5, 3+). This will help analyze the distribution of house configurations
  sold in the region in a specified timeframe. Use distinct colors for each bathroom
  count for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct bathroom
  counts?

  2. Would you like a legend to be included in the chart to clarify the color representation?

  3. What time frame should be considered for the house sales data?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the vertical and horizontal axis labels?

  5. Would you like to see the counts of houses sold as data labels on the bars?

  6. Is there a particular order you prefer for displaying the bedroom categories
  (e.g., ascending order)?

  7. Are there any specific bedroom or bathroom categories you wish to exclude from
  the chart?

  8. Do you have any font size or style preferences for the chart labels and title?

  9. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the width and height of the bars or the
  overall size of the chart?'
