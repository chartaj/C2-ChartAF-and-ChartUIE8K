initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the distribution of house prices in
  King County, USA. Please use the 'price' column from the given data to create this
  chart. It should illustrate the frequency of different price ranges to help understand
  the housing market better. The x-axis should represent price ranges, and the y-axis
  should represent the number of houses available in those ranges. Ensure the bins
  are appropriately sized to cover the wide range of house prices. This will help
  in analyzing how prices vary across different listings. Thank you!
questions: '1. What bin size or range for house prices would you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like any gridlines or specific formatting on the x-axis or y-axis?

  4. Should there be any labels or annotations on the histogram for important price
  ranges?

  5. Do you have specific preferences for the title or labels of the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Would you like to include any specific legends or keys in the histogram?'
