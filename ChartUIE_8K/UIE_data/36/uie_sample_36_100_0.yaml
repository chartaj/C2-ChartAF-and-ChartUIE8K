initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot visualizing the distribution of house
  prices in King County, USA. Annotate key data points like the median and outliers
  to emphasize significant values. Use highlights to distinguish between different
  ranges of house prices. This plot should help us understand the spread and concentration
  of house prices, providing insights into the housing market trends. Include helpful
  text annotations to give context to the visual elements, ensuring clarity for viewers
  who may not be familiar with this type of data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the highlights distinguishing
  different ranges of house prices?

  2. What specific data points would you like to see annotated besides the median
  and outliers?

  3. Would you prefer a separate legend explaining the color ranges, or should the
  ranges be marked directly on the plot?

  4. Is there a particular style for text annotations (e.g., font type, size, color)
  that you would prefer?

  5. Are there any additional statistical measures you would like displayed on the
  plot (e.g., mean, quartiles)?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the shape or smoothness of the violin plot
  (e.g., kernel density estimation bandwidth)?

  7. Should the y-axis be on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  8. Would you like to include any reference lines (e.g., average house price) on
  the plot?

  9. Are there any specific regions or subcategories within King County that should
  be highlighted or annotated separately?'
