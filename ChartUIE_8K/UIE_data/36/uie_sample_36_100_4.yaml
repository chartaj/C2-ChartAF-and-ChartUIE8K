initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart using the House Sales in King County data.
  I am interested in visualizing the average price of houses across different years.
  Use the 'yr_built' column for the x-axis and the 'price' column for the y-axis.
  Group the data by the 'yr_built' and calculate the average price for each year.
  Ensure the chart highlights trends in house prices over time to help understand
  how prices have evolved in different construction years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Should the chart include data labels showing the average price on each bar?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the background for better readability of
  values?

  5. Are there any specific years you would like to highlight or annotate on the chart?

  6. Would you like to add a title and subtitle to the chart? If so, what should they
  be?

  7. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the axis labels and title?

  8. Should the y-axis scale be linear or logarithmic?

  9. Is there a specific range for the y-axis you would like to set, or should it
  auto-adjust based on the data?

  10. Would you prefer to add tooltips or hover effects to provide more detailed information
  about each bar?

  11. Do you want to include a legend, even though there is only one data series?

  12. Would you like to apply any specific formatting to the y-axis values, such as
  currency formatting?

  13. Are there any specific themes or styles that you would like to apply to the
  overall look of the chart?'
