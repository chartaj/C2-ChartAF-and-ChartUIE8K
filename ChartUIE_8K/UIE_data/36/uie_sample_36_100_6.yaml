initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the house sales data in King County,
  USA. On the x-axis, plot the 'sqft_living' (square footage of the living space)
  and on the y-axis, plot the 'price' of the houses. Color the points based on the
  number of 'bedrooms' to see how the number of bedrooms correlates with the price
  and size of the house. Additionally, add a trend line to show the overall price
  trend as the living space increases.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like specific markers or shapes used for the data points?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the trend line (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  4. Should the axes have specific scales, such as logarithmic, or should they remain
  linear?

  5. Do you have preferences for the title and labels of the axes?

  6. Would you like any annotations or labels on the data points?

  7. Should grid lines be displayed on the plot? If so, any preferences for their
  style?

  8. Do you prefer having any specific font type or size for the text elements in
  the chart?

  9. Are there any additional legends or notes you''d like included in the chart?

  10. Would you like the chart to include tooltips or additional data displayed when
  hovering over the data points (even though only non-interactive aspects should be
  considered for design)?'
