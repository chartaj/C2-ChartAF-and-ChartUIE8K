initial_prompt: I would like an area chart that shows the historical price trends
  of Ethereum over time. Please plot the 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Price' on the y-axis.
  Additionally, use different colors to shade the areas between the 'High' and 'Low'
  prices for each date. This will help illustrate the volatility of Ethereum prices
  over time. Also, incorporate 'Change %' as a secondary line chart to show daily
  changes. Please ensure the chart is visually appealing and easy to understand. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. What color schemes do you prefer for the shaded areas between the ''High''
  and ''Low'' prices?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the line style or color for the ''Change
  %'' line chart?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and chart title?

  5. Should any specific data points (e.g., major highs and lows) be highlighted or
  annotated on the chart?

  6. Do you prefer the y-axis to be displayed in a specific range or with a particular
  scaling?

  7. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where should it be placed on the
  chart?

  8. Do you have any specific layout preferences for the chart (e.g., width, height,
  margins)?

  9. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to see on the
  chart (e.g., average price lines, significant events)?

  10. Are there any particular aesthetic elements you would like to see, such as background
  color or overall theme (e.g., dark mode, light mode)?'
