  \ time periods you would like to highlight or differentiate in the visualization?\n\
  4. Would you prefer the heatmap to display monthly, weekly, or daily data?\n5. Do\
  \ you have a preference for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g., vertical\
  \ versus horizontal)?\n6. Should any specific labels, legends, or annotations be\
  \ included in the heatmap?\n7. Would you like to include gridlines or separators\
  \ between different time periods or value ranges? \n8. Are there specific thresholds\
  \ or reference lines you would like to be highlighted on the heatmap?"
