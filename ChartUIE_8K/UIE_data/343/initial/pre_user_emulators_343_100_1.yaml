2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing Ethereum's historical price data. Use Data Points
  annotations to highlight significant days, focusing on the Date, Price, and Change
  %. Emphasize days with the highest and lowest price changes using Highlights. The
  purpose is to easily identify trends and fluctuations in Ethereum's market value
  over time, aiding investment decisions. Please ensure the chart is visually appealing
  and informative. This will help in analyzing historical market performance. A practical
  visualization makes the data insightful, especially for stakeholders tracking cryptocurrency
  trends.
