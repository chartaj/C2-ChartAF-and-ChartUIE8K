  focusing on the ''Price'' and ''Date'' columns. I want to compare the closing prices

  price for each date mentioned. Make the ''Date'' the x-axis and the ''Price'' the
  y-axis, clearly indicating the specific dates: Jul 30, 2022, Jul 29, 2022, and Jul
  28, 2022, on the x-axis, and their corresponding prices on the y-axis. Use different
  colors for each bar for better visual distinction.'
