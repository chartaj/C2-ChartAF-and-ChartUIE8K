02_initial_prompt: I want to visualize the Ethereum cryptocurrency historical performance
  using a candlestick chart. The chart should display the Date on the x-axis and the
  Price, Open, High, and Low values on the y-axis. Each candlestick should represent
  a single day, showing the opening price as a rectangular box, the closing price
  as the top or bottom of the box, and the high and low prices as wicks extending
  from the box. Ensure that changes in volume are also represented in the chart. Use
  color coding to indicate days with price increases and decreases.

  price increases and decreases?

  the candlestick chart or integrated into the candlestick bars?

  year)?

  4. Should the x-axis display every single date, or would you prefer periodic labels
  (e.g., weekly or monthly intervals)?

  5. How would you like to handle the volume labels (e.g., in millions, abbreviated
  as ''M'')?

  6. Do you have a preference for how the y-axis should be labeled (e.g., specific
  intervals, log scale)?

  7. Would you like to include any annotations or notes on specific dates/events that
  may have impacted prices?
