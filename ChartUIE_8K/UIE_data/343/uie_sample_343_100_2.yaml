initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing 'Price', 'Open', 'High', and
  'Low' values for 'Jul 30, 2022', 'Jul 29, 2022', and 'Jul 28, 2022' to visualize
  Ethereum's historical data trends. This will allow us to observe the differences
  between these values over the given dates, helping us analyze the market behavior.
  Highlight the bar for the 'High' value in a different color to draw attention. Include
  text annotations indicating the specific 'Price' values for each date to emphasize
  key data points for better insight into the volatility and performance of Ethereum.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the bars other than highlighting
  the ''High'' value in a different color?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color,
  position)?

  3. Do you have a preferred order for the bars within each group (e.g., Price, Open,
  High, Low)?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better reference? If
  yes, do you prefer horizontal, vertical, or both gridlines?

  5. Do you have a specific preference for the bar spacing or width in the grouped
  bar chart?

  6. Should the chart have a legend explaining the color codes and variables? If so,
  where would you like it positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please
  specify the text.

  8. Do you prefer specific axes titles for the x-axis and y-axis? If yes, please
  specify the titles.'
