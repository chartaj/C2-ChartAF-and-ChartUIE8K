initial_prompt: I need a column chart to visualize Ethereum's historical data from
  the provided CSV file. The chart should include columns for the 'Date,' 'Price,'
  'Open,' 'High,' 'Low,' 'Vol.,' and 'Change %'. For the x-axis, use the 'Date' column,
  and for each date, create separate columns representing the 'Price,' 'Open,' 'High,'
  'Low', with 'Vol.' and 'Change %' next to each other. Make sure to represent the
  'Price' and 'Open' in one color, 'High' and 'Low' in another, and use unique colors
  for 'Vol.' and 'Change %'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing ''Price'' and
  ''Open'', ''High'' and ''Low'', ''Vol.'' and ''Change %''?

  2. Would you like a specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  3. Do you want any grid lines on the chart for better readability? If so, would
  you prefer horizontal, vertical, or both?

  4. Is there a specific date range that you are most interested in viewing?

  5. How would you like to handle large date rangesâ€”by aggregating data (e.g., weekly,
  monthly) or displaying all data points individually?

  6. Would you like the chart to include tooltips or annotations for specific data
  points?

  7. Do you have a preferred layout for the legend?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a title? If so, what should it be?

  9. Do you want to add labels to each column to display their exact values?

  10. Would you prefer the columns to be clustered together or stacked to show the
  relationships more clearly?'
