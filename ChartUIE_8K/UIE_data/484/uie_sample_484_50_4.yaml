initial_prompt: Please create a density plot for the given dataset, focusing on the
  'theta' and 'area' columns. Highlight the concentration and distribution of data
  points for analysis in scientific research context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting the concentrations
  in the density plot?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the density plot?

  3. Should the plot include grid lines for easier readability of data points?

  4. Do you have a preferred axis scaling (e.g., linear or logarithmic) for the ''theta''
  and ''area'' columns?

  5. Would you like to add any reference lines or zones for specific values of ''theta''
  or ''area''?

  6. Do you prefer a specific aspect ratio for the plot to better visualize the data?

  7. Should the plot include a legend to interpret the color gradients used in the
  density plot?

  8. Do you want to apply any smoothing techniques to the density plot to better highlight
  data distributions?

  9. Are there specific data ranges for ''theta'' and ''area'' that you want to focus
  on or exclude?

  10. Would you like to display marginal histograms or density curves along the axes
  for additional context?'
