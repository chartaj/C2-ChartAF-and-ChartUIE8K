initial_prompt: Create a radar chart to visualize the r, theta, area, and colors columns.
  Use text annotations highlighting specific data points to focus attention. Emphasize
  certain elements by modifying their appearance for better insight into the dataset's
  structure.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting specific data
  points and elements?

  2. Are there specific threshold values or conditions for the data points you want
  to highlight?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape or style of markers used for annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations include both the ''r'' and ''theta'' values, or is
  one sufficient?

  5. Do you prefer the text annotations to be displayed inside or outside the radar
  chart?

  6. Are there particular elements or data ranges you want to emphasize more than
  others?

  7. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) or width to
  differentiate emphasized elements?

  8. Would you like to use different font styles or sizes for the text annotations
  to distinguish them from other text on the chart?

  9. Do you need a legend to describe the attributes and colors used in the radar
  chart?

  10. Should the axis labels and titles be customized in any way (e.g., specific formatting,
  names)?'
