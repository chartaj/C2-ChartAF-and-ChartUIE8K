initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing 'r' vs. 'theta' along with 'area'
  as bubbles sizes. Use text annotations to highlight values of 'r' and 'theta' at
  the most prominent points. Highlight any points where 'area' and 'colors' match.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like to specify the size range for the bubbles representing ''area''?

  3. How should prominent points be defined for text annotations? (e.g., top 5 largest
  bubbles, specific value thresholds)

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for the text annotations? (e.g., font size,
  color, placement)

  5. Should the plot include a legend to explain the color-coding and bubble size?

  6. Would you prefer grid lines or any specific background for the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis ranges or scalings? (e.g.,
  log scale, fixed range)

  8. Should there be any specific labeling for the axes or title for the chart?

  9. How should matches between ''area'' and ''colors'' be highlighted? (e.g., different
  shape, border color)'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. No specific requirements for the axis labels or title.

  9. Different shape would be good.'
