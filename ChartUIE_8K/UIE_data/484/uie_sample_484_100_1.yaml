initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the data from the given CSV file.
  Highlight specific data points where 'r', 'theta', 'area', and 'colors' show unique
  interactions. Apply text annotations to emphasize key values in 'r' and 'area' to
  guide viewers' focus. The visualization should help in data science and analytics
  by providing a clear, visual breakdown of how these parameters interact. Additionally,
  use different colors to highlight high-density areas and significant variances across
  the dataset, ensuring all details are captured clearly for in-depth analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for highlighting the high-density
  areas and significant variances?

  2. Would you like to specify how text annotations for key values in ''r'' and ''area''
  should appear (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Are there any specific ranges for ''r'', ''theta'', ''area'', or ''colors'' that
  you want to emphasize?

  4. How would you like to handle overlapping text annotations if they occur?

  5. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the heatmap (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical)?

  6. Are there additional labels, legends, or titles that you want to be included
  in the visualization?

  7. Do you have a preference for the granularity or bin size of the heatmap cells?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a legend and a title for the heatmap.

  7. I do not know.'
