  Please create a histogram to visualize the `radius_mean` column from the Breast
  Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. I want to see the distribution of the
  mean radius of tumors for all the 569 entries. Ensure that the bins are appropriately
  sized to capture the spread and frequency effectively. Additionally, color the histogram
  bars and add proper labels for the x-axis (Mean Radius) and y-axis (Frequency) to
  make it clear. Thank you!
