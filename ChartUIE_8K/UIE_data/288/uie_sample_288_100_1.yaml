initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation among all 'mean' feature
  variables in the Breast Cancer Dataset (Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI). Use data annotations
  to highlight values, particularly focusing on the highly correlated pairs. Shapes
  like rectangles can emphasize clusters of strong correlations. This will help in
  identifying patterns and relationships among features like radius_mean, texture_mean,
  and perimeter_mean for cancer diagnosis analysis. The visualization aims to aid
  in understanding feature interactions, which could be pivotal for medical practitioners
  or researchers focusing on breast cancer diagnosis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the heatmap?

  2. What color scheme would you like to use to highlight high and low correlations?

  3. How would you like the data annotations to be displayed (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds for correlation values that you want to emphasize
  using shapes like rectangles?

  5. Do you prefer any particular layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Should the axis labels be styled in a particular way (e.g., font type, size,
  color)?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color scale and correlation values?
  If so, how should it be styled?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer the data annotations to be in a readable font size and color, perhaps
  in black.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No specific preference for the layout or aspect ratio.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I am not sure about the styling.'
