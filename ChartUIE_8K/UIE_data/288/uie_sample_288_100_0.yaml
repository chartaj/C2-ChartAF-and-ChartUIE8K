initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of 'radius_mean',
  'texture_mean', and 'area_mean' for the Breast Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic
  UCI]. Include text annotations to highlight the outliers and key statistics such
  as median and quartiles. Use shape annotations like arrows to point out the median
  values. This visualization aims to help understand the central tendency and dispersion
  of these features in relation to breast cancer diagnosis. Add a brief description
  explaining the significance of these features in the context of diagnosing breast
  cancer.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the colors used in the box chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines? If so, should they be light or
  bold?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  4. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for text annotations and
  axis labels?

  5. How detailed would you like the text annotations to be when highlighting outliers
  and key statistics?

  6. Would you like the quartiles to be color-coded differently for better distinction?

  7. Do you have a preferred position for the legend (if needed) on the chart?

  8. Should we highlight the median values using a specific shape or style for the
  arrows?

  9. Would you prefer the box plot to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  10. Is there any background information or context that you would like to be included
  in the brief description section of the chart?'
answers: "1. I do not know.\n2. Yes, include grid lines. Light grid lines would be\
  \ fine.\n3. I am not sure.\n4. I don't have a specific preference.\n5. Highlight\
  \ key statistics such as median and quartiles, and mention a few notable outliers.\n\
  6. Yes, color-coding the quartiles differently would be useful.\n7. I have no specific\
  \ preference.\n8. You can use arrows or any distinct shape to point out the median\
  \ values.\n9. Vertically would be fine.\n10. Include information about how these\
  \ features help in diagnosing breast cancer. \n\n"
