initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features
  in the Breast Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. Highlight strong correlations
  using text annotations and use shape annotations to emphasize clusters of related
  features.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should specific correlation thresholds be used for highlighting strong correlations?

  3. Do you have preferences for the type of text annotations (e.g., font size, color)?

  4. What kind of shape annotations do you prefer for emphasizing clusters?

  5. Would you like the color scales to be adjusted for better contrast?

  6. How would you like to handle missing values, if any, in the dataset?

  7. Do you want a specific layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  8. Are there any specific features that you want to prioritize or focus on in the
  visualization?

  9. Would you like to include a legend or color bar for interpreting the correlation
  values?

  10. Do you have preferences on the clustering algorithm to use for identifying clusters?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, highlight correlations above 0.7 and below -0.7.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. I am not sure.
