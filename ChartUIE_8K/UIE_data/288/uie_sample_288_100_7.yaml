initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the `radius_mean` column from
  the Breast Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. I want to see the distribution
  of the mean radius of tumors for all the 569 entries. Ensure that the bins are appropriately
  sized to capture the spread and frequency effectively. Additionally, color the histogram
  bars and add proper labels for the x-axis (Mean Radius) and y-axis (Frequency) to
  make it clear. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the number of bins or the bin width in
  the histogram?

  2. What specific color would you like for the histogram bars?

  3. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart (e.g., monochromatic,
  complementary colors)?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the x-axis or y-axis scales (e.g.,
  logarithmic, specific range)?

  7. Are there any additional details or annotations you would like to include on
  the histogram?

  8. Do you have a preference for the arrangement or orientation of the histogram
  bars (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, the title should be "Distribution of Mean Radius of Tumors".

  6. I do not have any specific requirements.

  7. I do not have any additional details to include.

  8. Vertical bars are fine.'
