initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the production of craft
  beer over the years. Use 'year' on the x-axis and 'total_barrels', 'taxable_removals',
  and 'total_shipped' as the stacked components. Each column should represent a year,
  and different colors should indicate the different categories (total_barrels, taxable_removals,
  total_shipped). Include labels showing the number of brewers for better context.
  This will help understand the overall production trends and the distribution of
  different types of beer production activities in the craft beer industry over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different categories
  (''total_barrels'', ''taxable_removals'', ''total_shipped'')?

  2. How would you like the labels showing the number of brewers to be positioned
  on the chart?

  3. Should the chart include a legend explaining each color category?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text and labels in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific chart title and axis labels you would like to include?

  6. Do you have any preferences for grid lines or background colors in the chart?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have particular formatting, such as date formats
  or specific intervals?

  8. Do you want to highlight any specific years or data points within the chart?'

  2. I am not sure about the label positioning, whatever looks best.

  3. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining each color category.

  4. I do not have any specific font style or size preferences.

  5. The chart title could be "Craft Beer Production Over the Years," and the axis
  labels could be "Year" for the x-axis and "Barrels of Beer" for the y-axis.
