initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of total_barrels across
  different brewer_sizes from 2009 data on craft beer production. Include text annotations
  for the highest and lowest values to highlight extremes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the histogram?

  2. What style or format of text annotations would you prefer for highlighting the
  highest and lowest values (e.g., color, font size, bold)?

  3. Do you have a preferred bin size or number of bins for the histogram?

  4. Would you like gridlines to be included in the histogram?

  5. Should the histogram include any labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?
  If so, what specific labels or titles would you prefer?

  6. Is there a preferred aspect ratio or specific dimensions you would like the chart
  to adhere to?

  7. Would you like a legend to be included in the histogram, or is it unnecessary?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  9. Should there be any additional annotations or markers, aside from the highest
  and lowest values, to highlight other significant points or ranges?'
