initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the trends in craft beer production
  over time. Use the "year" as the x-axis and plot three lines for "total_barrels,"
  "taxable_removals," and "total_shipped" on the y-axis. The chart should show how
  production, taxable removals, and shipments have changed from 2009 onwards. This
  will help us understand industry growth and trends in the beer market. Ensure the
  lines are color-coded and include a legend for clarity. Highlight any significant
  changes or patterns over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent each of the
  lines in the chart?

  2. Would you like to specify the style or thickness of the lines?

  3. Should data points be marked on the lines, or should it be a smooth line?

  4. Are there specific year intervals that you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart, and if so, in which style (e.g., dashed,
  solid)?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  7. Should any annotations or callouts be added to highlight significant changes
  or patterns?

  8. Do you want a title for the chart, and if so, what should it be?

  9. Is there any specific formatting or labeling you prefer for the y-axis values?

  10. Would you prefer the legend to be placed in a specific location on the chart?'
