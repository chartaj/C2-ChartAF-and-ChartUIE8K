initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the cropland data for each
  continent over time. Use the "Entity" column for the different continents and the
  "Year" column for the x-axis. The "Cropland (HYDE (2017))" should represent the
  y-axis values aggregated by year. Ensure all missing values in the "Code" column
  are handled appropriately. Please present the data in a way that shows the growth
  of cropland area over the years for each continent distinctly. This chart will help
  understand the historical changes in cropland distribution across continents.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating continents
  in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show exact values?

  3. How would you like us to handle the missing values in the "Code" column?

  4. Do you prefer a specific title or caption for the chart?

  or y-axis (Cropland area)?

  6. Would you like to display a legend, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Should we include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  8. Would you like any specific annotations or markers for significant events or
  trends in the data?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  10. Do you want to include any additional context or descriptive text on the chart?'
