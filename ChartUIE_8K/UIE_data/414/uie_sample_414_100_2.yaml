  Create a heatmap using the provided cropland data by continent and year. Highlight
  Africa''s data points due to its historical trends in cropland usage. Add text annotations
  to display years with significant changes in cropland area. Ensure the heatmap visually
  distinguishes each continent to easily compare their cropland evolution from -10000
  to -8000. Utilize different color intensities to reflect variations in cropland
  areas. Include a legend and title for clarity. This visualization aims to highlight
  historical agricultural patterns and transitions across continents.
