2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a box chart to visualize cropland areas over years across continents. Use
  annotations to highlight key data points and trends, such as notable increases or
  decreases in cropland within certain years. Differentiate the continents by color
  to make the comparison clear. Highlight significant variances and outliers to understand
  agricultural trends better. The purpose is to provide a visual summary for easy
  interpretation of how cropland use has changed over time in different continents,
  which could be useful for historical agricultural analysis and future planning.
