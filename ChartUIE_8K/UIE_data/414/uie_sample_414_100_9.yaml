initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize cropland data across different
  continents over time. Use the provided dataset showing 'Cropland (HYDE (2017))'
  from the year -10000 to -8000. Plot ‘Year’ on the x-axis and 'Cropland (HYDE (2017))'
  on the y-axis, using different colors or markers for each 'Entity' (continent).
  Ignore missing 'Code' data. The plot should highlight trends or changes in cropland
  area for each continent from ancient times. Title the graph "Historical Cropland
  Data by Continent" and label axes appropriately. Include a legend to distinguish
  between the continents.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different continents?

  2. Would you like to use specific markers for each continent?

  3. What level of grid detail do you prefer (e.g., major and minor gridlines, only
  major gridlines)?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the title and axis labels?

  5. Should the legend be placed at a specific location in the plot (e.g., top right,
  bottom left)?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations on the plot to highlight certain data points
  or trends?

  7. Is there a specific range you want for the x-axis and y-axis, or should they
  be auto-scaled based on the data?

  8. Would you prefer a background color for the plot area or keep it white?

  9. Should we include any sub-titles or footnotes in the visualization?'
