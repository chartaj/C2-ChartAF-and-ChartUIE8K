initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize cropland areas over years across continents.
  Use annotations to highlight key data points and trends, such as notable increases
  or decreases in cropland within certain years. Differentiate the continents by color
  to make the comparison clear. Highlight significant variances and outliers to understand
  agricultural trends better. The purpose is to provide a visual summary for easy
  interpretation of how cropland use has changed over time in different continents,
  which could be useful for historical agricultural analysis and future planning.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating continents?

  2. Are there any particular years or time periods you want to emphasize with annotations?

  3. What style of annotations do you prefer (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  4. Do you have a preferred way to highlight significant variances and outliers (e.g.,
  different color or size)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for continents?

  6. Do you prefer any particular order for the continents in the visualization?

  7. Are there specific trends or key data points you already know of that should
  be highlighted?

  8. Would you like to include grid lines or other background elements to aid in interpreting
  the data?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Text boxes.

  4. Different color.

  5. Yes, please include a legend.

  6. No specific preference.
