initial_prompt: Visualize cropland change over time for each continent using a line
  chart. Highlight Africa for emphasis, as it's a focal point in the data. Annotate
  the chart with key historical points and trends, especially where there are spikes
  or drops in cropland. The chart should show trends from -10000 to the present era,
  illustrating how cropland has evolved. Ensure annotations highlight unique and essential
  aspects to guide viewer interpretation. This visualization will help understand
  agricultural development patterns and regional differences over centuries, vital
  for historical agricultural studies and modern policy development.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the lines representing different
  continents?
