initial_prompt: I have a dataset about cropland areas across different continents
  from 10,000 BC to recent years. I would like a geographic heatmap that shows the
  changes in cropland areas over time. For each continent, I want to visualize how
  cropland areas have expanded or contracted. Please use color gradients to depict
  the density of cropland. Missing data should be handled appropriately. The x-axis
  should be the years, and the y-axis should be the continents. Make sure the heatmap
  clearly shows trends over the entire time span.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for depicting the density of
  cropland areas?

  2. How would you like missing data to be handled or represented in the heatmap?

  3. What level of detail or granularity do you prefer for the year axis (e.g., every
  century, every millennium)?

  4. Are there specific continents or time periods you want to emphasize?

  5. Do you need labels or annotations for specific data points or trends?

  6. What is the preferred orientation for the heatmap (e.g., horizontal, vertical)?

  7. Is there a specific color palette or theme you would like to use, considering
  the audience?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Every century would be fine.

  4. No, I don''t have specific preferences for certain continents or time periods.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Horizontal orientation is preferred.

  7. I have no specific preference for a color palette or theme.'
