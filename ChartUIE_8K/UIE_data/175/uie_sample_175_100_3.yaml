initial_prompt: I'd like to create a histogram to visualize the distribution of ages
  among the top billionaires listed in the dataset. We'll plot the 'age' column on
  the x-axis and the frequency of each age group on the y-axis. Please ensure the
  bins are appropriately sized to capture meaningful groupings, and the histogram
  is clearly labeled, showing units on the axes. Additionally, could you use distinct
  colors to differentiate each bin? This will help to see the distribution more clearly.
  Thank you.
questions: '1. What specific range of ages do you want the histogram to cover?

  2. Do you have any preferred bin size for grouping the ages, or should the bin size
  be automatically determined?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would like to be used for the bins?

  4. What title would you like to give to the histogram?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for the labels and title?

  6. Would you like any specific annotations or markers on the histogram (e.g., mean
  age, median age)?

  7. Should the histogram display grid lines for better readability, and if so, do
  you have a preference for their style?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. The bin size can be automatically determined.

  3. I have no specific preference for the colors used for the bins.

  4. "Age Distribution of Top Billionaires"

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please display grid lines for better readability, but I have no preference
  for their style.'
