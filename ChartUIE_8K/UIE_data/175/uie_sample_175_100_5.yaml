initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of
  billionaires by industry and country from the Billionaires Statistics Dataset (2023).
  Use the column 'industries' for the x-axis and stack the bars by 'country'. Also,
  display each industry's total billionaire count alongside their final worth. Ensure
  each segment's value is labeled and color-coded by country for clarity. Include

  the y-axis represents the number of billionaires, and add grid lines for easier
  reading. Thank you!
