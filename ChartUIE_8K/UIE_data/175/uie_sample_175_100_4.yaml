initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the net worth (in millions)
  of the top billionaires over time (e.g., Bernard Arnault, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos).
  Use "finalWorth" on the y-axis and "birthYear" on the x-axis. Differentiate each
  individual with distinct lines or colors. Make sure to label the axes clearly and
  include a legend for the names. This will help track how their wealth has grown
  or changed over their lifetimes. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret
  for business insights.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or color\
  \ palette for the distinct lines representing each individual?\n2. Would you prefer\
  \ a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?\n3. Are there any\
  \ particular font styles or sizes you want to use for the axis labels and chart\
  \ title?\n4. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top,\
  \ bottom, left, right)?\n5. Is there a specific format you prefer for representing\
  \ the values on the y-axis (e.g., with commas, decimal points, etc.)?\n6. Should\
  \ there be any specific markers at each data point on the lines (e.g., circles,\
  \ squares, triangles)?\n7. Are there any particular chart dimensions or aspect ratios\
  \ you prefer? \n8. Would you prefer any gridlines or background elements to be included\
  \ or excluded in the chart to enhance readability?"
