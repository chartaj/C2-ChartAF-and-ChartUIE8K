initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing billionaires' final worth vs. age
  with data points highlighted by industry. Include text annotations for top 5 richest
  billionaires to draw attention to their values. Use different colors for each industry
  to distinguish them. Ensure the chart emphasises the age and wealth relationship
  among different industries. Provide additional non-data-driven annotations for context
  about top industries and their contribution to global GDP in 2023.
