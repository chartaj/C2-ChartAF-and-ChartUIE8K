initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the number of space flights over
  the years for NASA astronauts. Use data from the 'Year' and 'Space Flights' columns.
  Plot 'Year' on the x-axis and 'Space Flights' on the y-axis. Multiple astronauts
  may have the same year, so aggregate the total number of space flights per year.
  Keep in mind some years may have missing values. The chart should clearly show trends
  over time. Title the chart "NASA Space Flights Over the Years". Use a distinct color
  for the line to ensure clarity. Provide appropriate labels for axes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color for the line in the chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart title and axis labels?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be
  for both x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Are there specific markers or data points you would like highlighted on the line
  chart?

  5. Should the x-axis be displayed with every year labeled or at specific intervals
  (e.g., every 5 years)?

  6. Do you want the chart legend to show any specific information?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart background color or chart theme (light/dark)?

  8. Do you want any annotations or explanatory notes on the chart to highlight important
  trends or data points?'

  2. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Every 5 years would be fine.

  6. I have no specific preference.
