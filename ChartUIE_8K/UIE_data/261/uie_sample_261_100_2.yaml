initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the birthplaces of NASA astronauts
  from 1959 to the present. Include annotations displaying key information such as
  birthplaces and significant statistics like the number of space flights and spacewalks.
  Use highlights to emphasize regions with higher concentrations of astronaut births.
  This visualization will help understand geographic trends in astronaut origins and
  draw attention to notable contributors in the field of space and astronomy. The
  data spans various attributes, including alma maters and military branches, so make
  sure to provide context for a comprehensive view.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like specific icons or markers to represent significant birthplaces?

  3. How detailed should the annotations be for each birthplace?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the heatmap color gradients?

  5. Do you prefer a specific type of map projection for the geographic heatmap?

  6. How would you like the highlights for regions with higher concentrations of astronaut
  births to be displayed?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  8. Should the visualization include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they
  be?

  9. Would you like grid lines or borders to be displayed on the map for more precise
  location identification?

  10. How should the alma maters and military branches be integrated into the context
  provided?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Yes, specific icons or markers would be great.

  3. The annotations should be fairly detailed, including birthplaces, number of space
  flights, and spacewalks.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining the heatmap color gradients.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Highlights can be bolder colors or additional markers for higher concentrations.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, include a title and subtitle. Title: "Geographic Origins of NASA Astronauts
  (1959-Present)" Subtitle: "Birthplaces, Space Flights, and Spacewalk Contributions"

  9. I do not know.

  10. Integrate alma maters and military branches in a sidebar or footnote contextually.'
