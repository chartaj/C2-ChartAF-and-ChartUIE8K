initial_prompt: Create a dot plot for "NASA Astronauts, 1959-Present" categorized
  by "Year" and "Group". Each dot should represent an astronaut, colored to indicate
  "Status" (Active, Retired, etc.). Size of the dot should reflect the number of "Space
  Flights". Plot "Birth Place" on the y-axis to see geographic distribution over time.
  Highlight "Space Walks" on a secondary scale. Ensure missing values are handled
  gracefully. This visualization will show trends in astronaut selection, geographic
  diversity, and experience over time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different "Status"
  categories?

  2. How would you like missing values to be handled or represented in the visualization?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the size scale of the dots based on
  "Space Flights"?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be included on the plot?

  5. Are there any particular geographic regions or "Birth Places" that you would
  like to highlight or focus on?

  6. Should the secondary scale for "Space Walks" be represented in a specific way
  (e.g., different color intensity, additional markers)?

  7. Do you prefer a specific orientation or arrangement for the "Year" and "Group"
  categories on the plot?

  8. Are there any additional context or notes that should accompany the visualization?'

  dashed outline.

  3. I do not have any specific preferences for the size scale of the dots.

  4. No specific labels or annotations are needed.

  5. I do not have a specific region to focus on.

  6. I am not sure.
