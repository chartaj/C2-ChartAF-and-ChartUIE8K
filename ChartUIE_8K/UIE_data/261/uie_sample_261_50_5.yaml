  year for NASA astronauts from 1959 to the present. Include lines for different groups
  to compare trends over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the different lines
  representing the groups?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to clearly identify the different groups on
  the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) to
  differentiate between groups?

  4. Should data points on the lines be marked with symbols (e.g., circles, squares)
  or only the lines?
