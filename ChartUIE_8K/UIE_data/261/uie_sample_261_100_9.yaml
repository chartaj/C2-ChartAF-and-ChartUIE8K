initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of space
  flights and space walks for each astronaut. Use the 'Name' column for the x-axis
  with 'Space Flights' and 'Space Walks' as grouped bars for comparison. Highlight
  contrasting activities among astronauts spanning from 1959 to the present. Make
  sure to label axes clearly and assign distinct colors to each bar group to distinguish
  between space flights and space walks. This should help in understanding the experience
  and extra-vehicular activity participation of different astronauts over the years.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar groups representing
  ''Space Flights'' and ''Space Walks''?

  2. What title would you like to give to the chart?

  3. Are there specific font types or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  4. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or can it auto-scale based on the
  data values?

  5. Would you like the data values to be displayed on top of each bar for easier
  reference?

  6. Do you prefer any specific gridline styling or background color for the chart?

  7. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)?'
