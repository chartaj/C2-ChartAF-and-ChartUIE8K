initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization for the NASA Astronauts data. The chart
  should segment astronauts by their status categories (Active, Retired, Deceased).
  Within each status category, further divide by their undergraduate majors, showing
  the distribution of different majors. Display each segment proportional to the count
  of astronauts in that category.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  status categories (Active, Retired, Deceased)?

  2. Do you prefer any particular shading or gradation within the undergraduate majors?

  3. What specific labels or annotations, if any, would you like to include within
  the segments of the treemap?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  5. Would you like to include any legend for the status categories and undergraduate
  majors?

  6. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the treemap?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the border style or color between segments in
  the treemap?

  8. Should we include tooltips that appear on hover to show specific details for
  each segment? (Note: This question is for static non-interactive tooltips)'
