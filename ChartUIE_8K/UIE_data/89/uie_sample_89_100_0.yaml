initial_prompt: 'Visualize a box chart showcasing rotational speed by product type
  using the provided maintenance classification data. Highlight outliers to spot anomalies
  and potential failure patterns. Annotate key statistics like median speed and quartiles
  for each type. Use shapes to indicate trends or clusters in speed distribution.
  Purpose: To understand rotational speed variations across different product types
  and identify potential maintenance needs. Add a brief summary of findings based
  on highlighted anomalies and trends. Ensure the chart includes clear labels for
  axes, types, and speed values.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for differentiating product
  types?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability of the chart?

  3. Are there specific shapes you prefer for indicating trends or clusters in the
  speed distribution?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and annotations?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the various symbols and
  colors used?

  6. Should we use a specific range for the y-axis (rotational speed) or should it
  be auto-scaled based on the data?

  7. Would you prefer the key statistics (median, quartiles) to be displayed on the
  chart or in a separate legend/note?

  8. Are there any specific outliers or anomalies you are particularly interested
  in highlighting?

  9. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box plots (vertical or horizontal)?

  10. Should the summary of findings be included directly on the chart or as a separate
  text section?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I am not sure, maybe standard shapes like circles and squares?

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend explaining the various symbols and colors used.

  6. It should be auto-scaled based on the data.

  7. Display the key statistics (median, quartiles) directly on the chart.

  8. I do not know, just highlight any significant outliers.

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. Include the summary of findings as a separate text section.'
