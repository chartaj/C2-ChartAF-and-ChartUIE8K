initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap showing correlations among 'Air temperature
  [K]', 'Process temperature [K]', 'Rotational speed [rpm]', 'Torque [Nm]', and 'Tool
  wear [min]' for machine failure prediction.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the heatmap?

  2. Do you want to include labels for each cell in the heatmap to show correlation
  values?

  3. Should the heatmap display a color bar indicating the correlation scale?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of the correlation scale (e.g., -1 to
  1)?

  5. Is there a specific order or clustering of the data attributes that you would
  like in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific correlations or thresholds in the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size of the axis labels and
  title?'
