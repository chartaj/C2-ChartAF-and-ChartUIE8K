initial_prompt: I need a dot plot to visualize the machine predictive maintenance
  classification data. Please plot "Air temperature [K]" on the x-axis and "Rotational
  speed [rpm]" on the y-axis. Differentiate the points by "Type" (M, L, H) using different
  colors. Each point should also show "Torque [Nm]" as the size of the dot, and "Tool
  wear [min]" can be depicted by a secondary color gradient within the dots. Make
  sure the legend is clear, specifying what each color and size represents. The goal
  is to easily identify patterns or outliers in machine performance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different "Type"
  categories (M, L, H)?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color gradient for representing the "Tool wear [min]"
  within the dots?

  3. Would you like to set specific size ranges for the dots representing "Torque
  [Nm]"?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and legend?

  5. Do you want the axes to have specific scale types (linear, logarithmic, etc.)?

  6. Are there any specific axis label formats you prefer (e.g., units, precision)?

  7. Would you like any gridlines or reference lines included in the plot?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the background color or style of the chart?'
