initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap using the given Machine Predictive Maintenance
  Classification data. The heatmap should visualize the correlation between numerical
  features: ''Air temperature [K]'', ''Process temperature [K]'', ''Rotational speed
  [rpm]'', ''Torque [Nm]'', and ''Tool wear [min]''. Highlight the strength of correlations
  using different color intensities. Exclude non-numerical columns like ''UDI'', ''Product
  ID'', ''Type'', ''Target'', and ''Failure Type''. Ensure that you label the axes
  and include a legend for easier interpretation. Focus on showcasing how these variables
  are interrelated to help in predictive maintenance analysis. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme to be used in the heatmap?

  2. What range of correlation values do you want to see highlighted with specific
  colors?

  3. Would you like gridlines separating each cell in the heatmap?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want inside the heatmap cells
  (e.g., exact correlation values)?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Should the heatmap have a title or any additional text for context?

  7. Would you prefer the heatmap to have a specific size or aspect ratio?'
