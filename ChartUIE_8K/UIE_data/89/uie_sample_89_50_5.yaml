initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the provided dataset to visualize the
  relationship between "Rotational speed [rpm]" and "Torque [Nm]" for different "Product
  ID" types. Include color coding for "Type" and different markers for "Failure Type".
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the "Type" categories?

  2. Would you like specific marker shapes assigned to each "Failure Type"?

  3. Should the axes be displayed on a linear or logarithmic scale?

  4. Are there any particular axis ranges you would like to be set for "Rotational
  speed [rpm]" and "Torque [Nm]"?

  5. Do you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to identify the "Type" and "Failure Type" markers?

  7. Would you like to include data labels for the points in the scatter plot?

  8. Would you like to add trend lines to visualize the overall correlation?

  9. Do you have any preference for the title and axis labels of the chart?'
