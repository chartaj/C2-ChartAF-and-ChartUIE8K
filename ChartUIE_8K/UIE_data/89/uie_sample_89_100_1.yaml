initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize "Failure Type" distribution in machine
  predictive maintenance. Highlight significant failure types using distinct colors.
  Add annotations to emphasize key segments. Shapes like arrows can point out segments,
  with data-driven use of labels showing percentage each type contributes. Purpose
  is to easily see failure frequencies, assisting in understanding and prioritizing
  maintenance efforts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting the significant
  failure types?

  2. Is there a specific order in which you want the failure types to be displayed?

  3. Do you prefer specific fonts or text styles for the annotations?

  4. How detailed should the annotations be? (e.g., should they include only percentages,
  or also absolute numbers and descriptions?)

  5. Do you want any specific shapes or styles for the arrows pointing to the segments?

  6. Are there any company branding guidelines we should follow for colors or fonts?

  7. Should the chart include a legend explaining the colors used for each failure
  type?

  8. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the pie chart?

  9. Would you like the chart to include a title or subtitle? If so, do you have specific
  wording for them?

  10. Are there any specific failure types you want to be particularly emphasized
  or highlighted?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific order preference.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Percentages would be nice, and maybe also absolute numbers.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the colors used for each failure type.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, please include a title. "Failure Type Distribution in Machine Predictive
  Maintenance"

  10. Emphasize any failure types that account for a significant percentage, typically
  those above 15%.'
