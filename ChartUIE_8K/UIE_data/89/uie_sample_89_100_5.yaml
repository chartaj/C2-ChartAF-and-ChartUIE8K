initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'Air temperature
  [K]' and 'Process temperature [K]' from the given Machine Predictive Maintenance
  Classification dataset. I would like each temperature parameter to be represented
  with different colors on the same chart for comparison. This visualization will
  help to understand the variance in temperature readings within the dataset, which
  could be critical for predictive maintenance analysis. Ensure the chart includes
  labeled axes, a legend, and an appropriate title for clarity. Use bins that effectively
  show the spread and differences in the temperature data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing ''Air temperature
  [K]'' and ''Process temperature [K]''?

  3. How many bins would you like to use for the histogram?

  4. Do you have any preference for the range of the axes?

  5. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  6. Do you have any additional labels or annotations you would like to include on
  the chart?'
