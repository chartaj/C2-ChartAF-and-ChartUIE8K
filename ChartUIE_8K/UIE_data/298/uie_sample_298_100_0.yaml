initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize CO2 emissions by different transport
  sectors from 1990 to 2016. Use the "Category" for the legend and yearly data for
  the X-axis, while emissions values are on the Y-axis. Highlight significant trends,
  especially for "Cars" and "Light commercial vehicles." Add text annotations to signal
  peaks or drops in emissions. Emphasize the overall rise in emissions for each category
  to understand long-term trends and sectoral contributions to environmental impact.
  Make the chart visually distinguishable using color coding for each category. Ensure
  the chart is clear and informative for environmental science studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different transport sectors?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have any specific fonts or font sizes in mind for the text annotations
  and labels?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a particular position on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, right)?

  5. Are there any specific trends or data points, other than peaks or drops, you
  want to highlight?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style for the line markers (e.g., circles, squares,
  triangles) on the chart?

  7. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If yes, what
  should they be?

  8. Should there be any specific margin or padding settings for the chart?

  9. Do you need a caption or source information to be displayed on the chart?

  10. Is there a particular layout for the annotations (e.g., above, below, or next
  to the data point) that you prefer?'
