initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the weekly attendance trends for
  different sports at various parks in Queens, focusing on Playgrounds. Display the
  attendance from Sunday to Saturday using different colored lines for each sport.
  Highlight significant attendance peaks and annotate with data-driven text for days
  with highest and lowest attendance to emphasize key points. Include context and
  editorial comments where necessary to provide insights about sports participation
  over the weeks. The purpose is to understand attendance patterns and identify which
  sports and days attract the most participants.
