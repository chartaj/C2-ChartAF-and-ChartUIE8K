  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.

  4. Do you have preferences for the size of nodes based on specific attributes (e.g.,
  size proportional to the number of collaborations)?

  5. Should the edge thickness vary according to the intensity of the collaborations?
  If so, what range or scale should be used?
