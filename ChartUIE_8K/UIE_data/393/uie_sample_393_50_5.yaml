initial_prompt: Create a network graph showing academic collaborations between universities,
  using 'id' for nodes and 'source' to 'target' connections. Label nodes with 'name'.
  Highlight nodes based on 'value'.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting nodes based
  on ''value''?

  2. Should the size of the nodes be proportional to any particular attribute, such
  as the number of connections?

  3. Do you prefer to use specific shapes for nodes representing different types of
  universities or departments if applicable?

  4. Would you like to include any particular layout for the network graph, such as
  a circular, hierarchical, or force-directed layout?

  5. Are there any specific labels or legends you want included to enhance the understanding
  of the network graph?

  6. Should the thickness of the edges between nodes vary according to any specific
  attribute, such as the strength or number of collaborations?

  7. Do you want to display any additional information when hovering over the nodes
  or edges, such as collaboration details?'
