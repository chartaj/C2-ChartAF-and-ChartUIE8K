- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Treemap that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Treemap that utilizes
  all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a Treemap to visualize the academic collaborations between universities
  based on the provided data. Use the 'Type' to differentiate nodes from other types.
  The 'id' and 'name' fields should label the nodes representing different universities.
  Highlight the connections between universities by mapping the 'source' and 'target'
  fields. Use 'value' to size the nodes or connections if possible. The chart should
  clearly depict the network of collaborations, making it easy to identify which universities
  are most interconnected. Ensure the Treemap is intuitive and conveys the relationships
  effectively.
