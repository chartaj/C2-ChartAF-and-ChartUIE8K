initial_prompt: Please create a network graph visualizing the academic collaboration
  between universities as detailed in the provided dataset. The nodes should represent
  the universities (e.g., Harvard, MIT, Stanford), and the edges should illustrate
  the collaborations (source to target) and their intensity (value). Incorporate the
  missing data points sensibly and ensure the different types of collaborations are
  distinguishable. Add labels to nodes and, if possible, hover or click details to
  provide more information about each node and connection. Please color code the types
  of collaborations for better clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred layout for the network graph (e.g., circular,
  force-directed)?

  2. Is there a specific color palette you would like for the different types of collaborations?

  3. How would you prefer missing data points to be handled or represented?

  4. Do you have preferences for the size of nodes based on specific attributes (e.g.,
  size proportional to the number of collaborations)?

  5. Should the edge thickness vary according to the intensity of the collaborations?
  If so, what range or scale should be used?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the labels on
  the nodes?

  7. Is there any additional information you''d like displayed in the hover or click
  details for each node and connection?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the types of collaborations and
  their color coding? If so, do you have a specific placement preference for the legend?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific color palette in mind.

  3. I am not sure about how to handle missing data points.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the edge thickness should vary according to the intensity of the collaborations,
  but I am not sure about the range or scale.

  6. I do not have preferences for the font styles or sizes.

  7. I would like additional information displayed in the hover or click details,
  but I am not sure what specific information.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to explain the types of collaborations and their
  color coding. I do not have a specific placement preference for the legend.'
