initial_prompt: I have a dataset that contains columns for Year, Date, and Temperature
  with no missing values. The data represents the highest monthly temperatures recorded
  in Amherst. I need a line chart to visualize this data. The X-axis should represent
  the Date, and the Y-axis should represent the Temperature. Each line on the chart
  should correspond to a different Year, allowing for a comparison of temperature
  trends over different years. Please ensure the chart clearly highlights the temperature
  fluctuations across the given months for the available years in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for different
  years in the line chart?

  2. Should the lines representing different years have different styles (e.g., solid,
  dashed, dotted)?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines, and if so, what style of
  markers do you prefer?

  4. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the X-axis labels?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, should
  they be shown for both axes or just one?

  6. How should the legend be positioned on the chart (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Do you need any annotations or specific labels to highlight key temperature points
  or trends?

  8. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the X-axis, Y-axis,
  or the chart itself?

  9. Would you prefer the chart to display month names on the X-axis, or would numerical
  representation suffice?

  10. Do you require any tooltips or hover text to display specific data values when
  the user hovers over a data point?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer the date format to be in "MMM" (e.g., Jan, Feb).

  5. Yes, grid lines on the chart would be helpful for better readability, shown for
  both axes.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the legend position.

  7. I do not know.

  8. The X-axis should be labeled "Date," the Y-axis should be labeled "Temperature,"
  and the chart title should be "Highest Monthly Temperatures Recorded in Amherst."

  9. Month names on the X-axis would be preferred.

  10. I do not need tooltips or hover text.'
