initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the monthly highest temperatures
  in Amherst. The data includes the years, specific dates, and temperature readings.
  Highlight the data points corresponding to critical temperature shifts to emphasize
  important patterns. Add text annotations to notable data points for context. This
  visualization helps in understanding temperature trends and identifying unusual
  temperature variations across different months and years. Ensure the chart is informative
  for weather analysis purposes, clearly showing how temperature fluctuates and its
  implications for climate studies. Maintain clarity and visual appeal in the scatter
  plot.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Should the x-axis represent the specific dates or the years?

  3. How would you like the critical temperature shifts to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, shape, or size)?

  4. Do you prefer text annotations to be in any specific font size or style?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have a preference for the title and axis labels?

  7. Should grid lines be included in the background for better readability?

  8. How would you like the data points to be marked (e.g., circles, squares)?

  9. Do you have any preferred format for the date display on the x-axis (e.g., Month/Year,
  Day/Month/Year)?

  10. Would you like the scatter plot to include trend lines or any other statistical
  markers?'
