initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the age distribution across different
  file counts in the dataset, ensuring to distinguish between 'train' and 'test' splits.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should each age range be represented by specific colors?

  3. Do you prefer to display the exact count values within each heatmap cell?

  4. What range of values would you like the color scale to cover, for instance, should
  it be normalized or use raw counts?

  5. Do you have a preference for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Should the heatmap include a legend indicating what each color represents?

  7. Is there a specific order in which the age categories should be displayed (e.g.,
  ascending age order)?

  8. Do you prefer gridlines within the heatmap for better cell separation?

  9. Would you like to include annotations or labels indicating ''train'' and ''test''
  split counts separately?'
