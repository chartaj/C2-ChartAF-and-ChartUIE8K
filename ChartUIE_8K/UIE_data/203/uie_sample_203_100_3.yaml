initial_prompt: I need a heatmap showing the distribution of image files based on
  age groups and their respective data splits (train/test). Each cell in the heatmap
  should represent the count of image files for a specific age group (e.g., 18-20)
  in a certain split (e.g., train). The x-axis should display age groups, and the
  y-axis should display data splits. Use a color gradient to indicate higher or lower
  counts. This visualization will help understand how data is distributed across different
  age categories and splits in the Age Detection - Face Recognition Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap (e.g., from
  blue to red, green to yellow)?

  2. Would you like specific labels or annotations on each cell indicating the count
  of images, or should this be reflected solely by color?

  3. Is there a particular order you would prefer the age groups to be listed on the
  x-axis?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the title or labels for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient and corresponding
  counts?

  6. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for axis labels and data
  annotations?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines to separate the cells more distinctly within
  the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred aspect ratio or size for the heatmap to better fit your
  presentation or report format?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No, I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend explaining the color gradient and corresponding
  counts.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, I have no specific preference.'
