initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the age distribution in the face recognition
  data, highlighting and annotating specific age ranges (e.g., '18-20') and splits
  (train/test). Emphasize the frequency and spread of images across different age
  groups. Use highlights to distinguish between 'train' and 'test' data points to
  focus attention on dataset composition. Annotations should provide insights into
  data uniqueness and missing values. This visualization will aid in understanding
  the dataset's structure, facilitating age detection model development and health-related
  research.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting ''train''
  and ''test'' data points?

  2. Would you like to use any particular theme or style for the chart?

  3. Should the annotations be placed outside or inside the boxes?

  4. Do you want to use any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  5. Is there any particular font type or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  6. How would you like the age ranges (e.g., ''18-20'') to be highlighted?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish ''train'' and ''test'' data
  points?

  8. Do you want the chart to include tooltips for more detailed information on hover?

  9. Is there any specific layout preference (e.g., horizontal or vertical orientation)
  for the box chart?

  10. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reading of values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. Inside the boxes.

  4. No specific preference.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Highlighted with distinct colors.

  7. Yes, please include a legend.

  8. No.

  9. Vertical orientation.

  10. Yes, please include gridlines.'
