  end_time, highlighting src_ip interactions by country code.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different country
  codes?

  2. Would you prefer the line chart to display data at specific time intervals (e.g.,
  hourly, daily)?

  3. Do you want the creation_time or end_time to be the primary time axis for the
  line chart?

  4. Should the chart include tooltips or labels that show specific values for bytes_in
  and bytes_out?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to identify the data lines for bytes_in and
