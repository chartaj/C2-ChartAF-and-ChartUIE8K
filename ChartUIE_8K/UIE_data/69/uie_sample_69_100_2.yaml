initial_prompt: I want a stacked column chart that shows the 'bytes_in' and 'bytes_out'
  for various 'src_ip' addresses over time. This should help in identifying patterns
  and potential anomalies in data traffic. Use text annotations to display the exact
  'bytes_in' and 'bytes_out' values for notable 'src_ip' entries, drawing attention
  to unusually high or low traffic. Highlight the 'src_ip' from different countries
  with different colors to distinguish their geographical origins. This would help
  in understanding and monitoring suspicious web threats efficiently. The chart is
  for analyzing cybersecurity threats.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to highlight
  ''src_ip'' from different countries?

  2. Would you prefer a specific time interval (e.g., hourly, daily) for aggregating
  the data over time?

  3. Are there any particular ''src_ip'' addresses or country codes you consider particularly
  notable and want to always display their text annotations?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the color codes for different
  countries?

  6. Should the chart have a grid to improve readability or any other specific background
  style?

  7. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or titles on the
  axes?

  8. Are there any specific ranges for ''bytes_in'' and ''bytes_out'' that you consider
  unusually high or low and would like to highlight?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I would prefer daily aggregation over time.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, I would like the chart to include a legend explaining the color codes for
  different countries.

  6. Yes, a grid would be good to improve readability.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.'
