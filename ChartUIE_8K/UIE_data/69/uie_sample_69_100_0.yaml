initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing the volume of web traffic
  interactions across different countries based on the provided dataset. Highlight
  regions with high traffic from countries like AE, US, and CA. Annotate specific
  IP addresses and bytes transferred to draw attention to unusual activity. Use the
  ‘Suspicious Web Traffic’ and ‘Adversary Infrastructure Interaction’ observations
  to provide context. The goal is to focus on identifying potential cybersecurity
  threats and their geographical origins, making it easier to spot and address areas
  of concern. Include necessary color codes to emphasize traffic intensity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for indicating different levels
  of web traffic intensity?

  2. Would you like any specific color to be used for highlighting regions with high
  traffic from AE, US, and CA?

  3. Should the annotations for IP addresses and bytes transferred be displayed as
  tooltips or directly on the map?

  4. Do you have any preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  5. Are there any particular thresholds for byte traffic that should trigger specific
  visual markers for unusual activity?

  6. How prominently would you like the ''Suspicious Web Traffic'' and ''Adversary
  Infrastructure Interaction'' observations to be displayed? Any specific way of showing
  these?

  7. Would you prefer to have a legend or a separate section to explain the color
  codes used for traffic intensity?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Directly on the map.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Prominently, but I am not sure about the specific way.

  7. Yes, a legend would be good.'
