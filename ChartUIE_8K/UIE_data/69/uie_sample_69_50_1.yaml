initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize suspicious web traffic interactions,
  focusing on bytes_in and bytes_out. Highlight points by src_ip_country_code. Annotate
  significant data points to emphasize the detection of adversary infrastructure.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for highlighting different src_ip_country_code
  points?

  2. Do you have specific criteria for which data points should be annotated as significant?

  3. Would you like to include axis labels and a chart title? If so, what should they
  be?

  4. Do you prefer a specific marker shape or style for the scatter plot points?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color coding for src_ip_country_code?

  6. Is there a particular range for bytes_in or bytes_out that we should zoom in
  on?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better reference?
  If so, should they be major or minor grid lines?

  8. Do you have any specific font preferences for the annotations and labels?

  9. Is there any additional contextual information that you would like displayed
  on the chart?'
