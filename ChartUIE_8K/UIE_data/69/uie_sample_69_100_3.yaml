initial_prompt: I need a line chart comparing inbound and outbound data (bytes_in
  and bytes_out) over time for suspicious web traffic. Use creation_time for the time
  axis and plot separate lines for each source IP (src_ip). Highlight key points like
  the src_ip_country_code and detection_types. This will help visualize patterns and
  identify spikes in traffic related to potential adversary interactions. Use different
  colors for each src_ip to make the chart clear and understandable. Add markers for
  significant events and anomalies indicated by the rule_names. Ensure the chart is
  easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the line chart?

  2. What specific time intervals would you like to see on the time axis (e.g., hourly,
  daily)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color palette for the different src_ip lines?

  4. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed?

  5. How would you like significant events and anomalies (indicated by rule_names)
  to be marked (e.g., specific shapes, labels)?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the
  inbound and outbound data?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart background to enhance readability?

  8. What specific information should be included in the tooltips for data points
  (e.g., exact values, src_ip_country_code, detection_types)?

  9. Do you prefer the x-axis and y-axis labels to be oriented in any specific way
  (e.g., rotated, horizontal)?

  10. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?'
