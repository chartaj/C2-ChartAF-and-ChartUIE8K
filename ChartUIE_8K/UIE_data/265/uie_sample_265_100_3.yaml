initial_prompt: I need a line chart that shows the trend of total cases and total
  deaths over time for USA, India, and France. Use the 'Total Cases', 'Total Deaths',
  and 'Country' columns. The x-axis should represent each country, and the y-axis
  should show the numbers of total cases and deaths. Make sure the chart is clear
