  4. Would you like any statistical values (mean, median, etc.) highlighted or indicated

  by country name, by testing rate, etc.)?

  6. Do you need grid lines or any specific ticks on the axes?

  7. Would you like to add a title and/or axis labels to the chart? If so, please
  specify the text.

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text in the chart?
