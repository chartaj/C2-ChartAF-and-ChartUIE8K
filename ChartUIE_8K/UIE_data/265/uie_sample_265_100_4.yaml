initial_prompt: I want to create a heatmap to visualize the impact of COVID-19 across
  various countries using the provided dataset. The heatmap should show data like
  Total Cases, Total Deaths, Active Cases, and Total Recovered for each country. The
  intensity of the color should represent the magnitude of each value, making it easy
  to compare the severity and spread of the virus across different countries. This
  will help to identify which countries have been hit hardest by the pandemic. Ensure
  that the country names are clearly labeled on one axis and the categories on the
  other.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color intensity scale be linear or logarithmic?

  3. Would you like to add any specific labels or annotations to highlight certain
  countries or values?

  4. Are there specific countries you would like to focus on or exclude from the visualization?

  5. Do you prefer the country names to be displayed on the x-axis or y-axis?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color intensity?

  7. Should the heatmap include borders or separation lines between countries and
  categories?

  8. Are there any specific font sizes or styles you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  9. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the heatmap?

  10. Is there any additional information or context you would like to include in
  the visualization?'
