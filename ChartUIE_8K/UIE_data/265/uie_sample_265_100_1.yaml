initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the top 10 countries based on Total
  Cases of COVID-19. Use different colors to highlight the top three countries. Include
  text annotations for Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered for these top
  three countries to focus attention on them. The x-axis should represent countries,
  and the y-axis should represent the number of cases. This visualization aims to
  provide a clear comparison of the COVID-19 impact across these countries, aiding
  in understanding the spread and severity of the pandemic.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the colors used to highlight the top
  three countries?

  2. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the text annotations?

  3. Should the x-axis labels be rotated for better readability? If so, what angle
  would you prefer?

  4. Do you have a preferred ordering for the countries on the x-axis (e.g., descending
  order of Total Cases)?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  6. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like to include for the chart?

  7. Do you want legend placement to be in any specific location on the chart?

  8. Should the data values (Total Cases, Total Deaths, Total Recovered) for the top
  three countries be displayed in a particular format (e.g., comma-separated, abbreviated
  with ''K'', ''M'')?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the background color or border style of the chart?

  10. Would you require any additional labels or descriptions on the chart to enhance
  clarity?'

  2. I do not know.

  4. Yes, descending order of Total Cases.

  5. Yes, major gridlines should be fine.

  6. Title: "Top 10 Countries by COVID-19 Total Cases"

  7. I have no specific preference.
