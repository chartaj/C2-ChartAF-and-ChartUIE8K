initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing COVID-19 data, specifically Total
  Cases per 1M population, across different countries. Highlight countries with the
  highest and lowest infection rates. Use data-driven text annotations to display
  values for Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered when hovering over each
  country. The purpose is to assess the global impact of COVID-19 and identify regions
  with the most significant outbreaks. Ensure the map visually emphasizes areas with
  severe cases and critical conditions. Use colors to represent different case ranges
  for better visual understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different case
  ranges?

  2. Should the map projection follow any specific geographical standard (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?

  3. How should countries with missing data be represented on the map?

  4. Should there be a legend indicating the color ranges and their corresponding
  data values?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  6. Should the annotations for Total Cases, Total Deaths, and Total Recovered include
  any additional context or formatting?

  7. How should the map handle overlapping labels or crowded regions?

  8. Is there any specific method you want to use to highlight the countries with
  the highest and lowest infection rates (e.g., border highlight, specific colors)?

  9. Should the map include additional contextual elements, such as country borders
  or major cities?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color scheme.

  2. I do not have a preference for the map projection.

  3. Countries with missing data can be represented in gray.

  4. Yes, there should be a legend indicating the color ranges and their corresponding
  data values.

  5. I am not sure about the font style and size of the text annotations.

  6. I do not know if any additional context or formatting is needed for the annotations.

  7. I do not know how the map should handle overlapping labels or crowded regions.

  8. Highlight the countries with the highest and lowest infection rates using specific
  colors.

  9. I do not have a specific preference for including additional contextual elements
  like country borders or major cities.'
