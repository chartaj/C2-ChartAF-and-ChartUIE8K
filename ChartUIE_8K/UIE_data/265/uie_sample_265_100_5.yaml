initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize COVID-19 data from the dataset.
  Use the 'Country,\r\nOther' column for the x-axis to represent countries. For each
  country, stack the bars to show 'Total\r\nCases', 'Total\r\nDeaths', 'Total\r\nRecovered',
  and 'Active\r\nCases'. This will help in comparing the overall impact of the pandemic
  across countries in terms of cases, deaths, recoveries, and active cases. Ensure
  each section of the bar is distinguishable by different colors. Include a legend
  to indicate which color corresponds to each category.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different sections of
  the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be sorted based on any particular metric (e.g., total
  cases, total deaths)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font or font size for the labels and legend?

  4. Do you want to include data labels within the bars to show the actual values?

  5. Should the y-axis display absolute numbers or would you like to see percentages
  for each section of the bar?

  6. Would you like to emphasize any particular countries or categories in the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  8. Would you like any additional annotations or insights included in the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a grid layout for easier comparison between countries?'
