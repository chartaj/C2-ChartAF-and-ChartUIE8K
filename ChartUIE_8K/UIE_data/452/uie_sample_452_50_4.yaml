initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap comparing Temperature (K) and Pressure for both
  Liquid and Gas states in the dataset. Utilize color gradients representing data
  intensity to enhance clarity and insight.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color palette or color gradients for the
  heatmap?

  2. How would you like the color intensity to be represented on the heatmap?

  3. Are there any specific labels or annotations you wish to include on the heatmap?

  4. Do you want the heatmap to display a legend explaining the color gradients?

  5. Should the heatmap include axes labels with units?

  6. Do you prefer any specific arrangement or layout for comparing liquid and gas
  states?

  7. Do you have any preference for the scale (linear or logarithmic) of the temperature
  and pressure axes?

  8. Are there any specific ranges of temperature and pressure you want to highlight
  or focus on?

  9. Would you like to include grid lines or any other background elements on the
  heatmap for better readability?

  10. Do you have a preferred title or caption for the heatmap?'
