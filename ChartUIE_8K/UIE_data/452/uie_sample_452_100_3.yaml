initial_prompt: Create a box chart for the Dow Jones Industrial Average data. The
  chart should visualize the distribution of temperatures and pressures for both liquid
  and gas states. On the X-axis, plot the 'Temperature(K)' and 'Temperature(K).1'
  columns and on the Y-axis, plot 'Pressure(Liquid)' and 'Pressure(Gas)' columns.
  Use separate colors for liquid and gas pressures to distinguish them clearly. This
  will help in comparing the variations and outliers in temperature and pressure values
  for different states. Missing values should be handled properly in the visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between liquid
  and gas pressures?

  2. What should be the handling method for missing values (e.g., removal, interpolation)?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Do you have a specific title or labels you want for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  5. Are there any specific needs for axis scaling (e.g., logarithmic scale)?

  6. Should there be annotations or markers for extreme values or outliers?

  7. Do you prefer a particular style for the box plots (e.g., traditional, notched)?

  8. Is there a need to include a legend to differentiate between liquid and gas pressures?'
