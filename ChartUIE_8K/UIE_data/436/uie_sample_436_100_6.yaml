initial_prompt: Please create a Donut chart visualizing the average times per lap
  of different marbles in the Marbula 1 Season 1 championship. Use 'marble_name' for
  the slices, 'avg_time_lap' to represent each slice's size, and 'team_name' in the
  legend for additional context. This chart should help in understanding which marbles
  are quickest on average, providing insights into their performance throughout the
  season. Ensure the chart is visually engaging by using different colors for each
  team and clear labels for each marble's average time. This will assist in analyzing
  race outcomes and performance trends over time.

  different teams in the chart?

  4. Do you prefer percentage values to be shown along with average times in the slices?
