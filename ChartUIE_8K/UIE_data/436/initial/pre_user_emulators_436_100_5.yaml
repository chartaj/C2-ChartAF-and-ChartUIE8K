- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the performance of different marbles
  in the Marbula 1 Season 1 races. Specifically, plot 'number_laps' against 'avg_time_lap'
  for each marble to see their lap times across different races. Color each marble
  by 'team_name' and use different shapes for different 'race'. Ensure the plot shows
  the spread and clustering of lap times, highlighting which teams/marbles consistently
  perform better or worse. Include a legend for teams and races. Scatter plot should
  also display 'track_length_m' as a variable size of the points to add another dimension
  to the analysis.
