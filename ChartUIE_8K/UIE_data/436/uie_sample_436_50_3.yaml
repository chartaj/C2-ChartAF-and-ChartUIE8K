initial_prompt: I need a line chart showing the average lap time trends for different
  races in Marbula 1 Season 1. Use "date" on the x-axis and "avg_time_lap" on the
  y-axis. Different lines should represent various "marble_name". Also, include "team_name"
  in the tooltip.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different marble lines?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, both major and minor gridlines
  or just major ones?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or units defined?

  4. Do you prefer a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for different marbles?

  5. Would you like markers on data points to be displayed along the lines? If yes,
  any specific marker style?

  6. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top,
  bottom, left, or right)?

  7. Do you have any preference for font style or size for axis labels and titles?
