initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the Marbula 1 Season 1 championship
  rankings over time, emphasizing the performance variations among teams. Annotate
  notable outliers and high-performance points, highlighting key dates and track sites
  like "Savage Speedway." Use text annotations to specify race stages such as "S1Q1"
  and "Pole" positions. Highlight elements like the fastest and slowest average lap
  times to make them stand out visually. The purpose is to allow quick insights into
  team performance trends, showcase fluctuations, and offer context to understand
  the competitive landscape across different races.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme or palette for distinguishing
  different teams?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for easier reference of data
  points?

  3. How would you like the annotations for notable outliers and high-performance
  points to be displayed (e.g., arrows, circles, text labels)?

  4. Should the different race stages and pole positions be color-coded or just annotated
  with text?

  5. Do you prefer the fastest and slowest average lap times to be shown with special
  markers (e.g., star, diamond) or highlighted in a different color?

  6. Would you like the track sites such as ''Savage Speedway'' to be displayed on
  a secondary axis or as part of the main annotations on the chart?

  7. Do you want a legend or key to explain the symbols and colors used in the annotations?'

  2. Yes, grid lines would be helpful.

  3. Arrows and text labels would be great for annotations.

  4. Just annotated with text is fine.

  5. I prefer the fastest and slowest average lap times to be highlighted in a different
  color.

  6. I am not sure.
