initial_prompt: I want to create a scatter plot to visualize the performance of different
  marbles in the Marbula 1 Season 1 races. Specifically, plot 'number_laps' against
  'avg_time_lap' for each marble to see their lap times across different races. Color
  each marble by 'team_name' and use different shapes for different 'race'. Ensure
  the plot shows the spread and clustering of lap times, highlighting which teams/marbles
  consistently perform better or worse. Include a legend for teams and races. Scatter
  plot should also display 'track_length_m' as a variable size of the points to add
  another dimension to the analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to represent
  different ''team_name''?

  2. Is there a specific set of shapes you prefer to use for different ''race'' categories?

  3. Do you want any specific type of legend placement or layout in the chart?

  4. What title or specific labels would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you want to include to emphasize
  certain data points or trends?

  6. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and legend?

  7. Would you like to add gridlines or any background elements to the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preferences for the color scheme used to represent
  different ''team_name''.

  2. I am not sure about the specific set of shapes for different ''race'' categories.

  3. I do not know about any specific legend placement or layout in the chart.

  4. Please use ''Number of Laps'' for the x-axis and ''Average Time per Lap (s)''
  for the y-axis.

  5. I do not have any specific annotations or highlights in mind.

  6. I have no specific preference for the font style or size for the labels and legend.

  7. I do not have a preference; use your best judgment for gridlines or background
  elements.'
