initial_prompt: 'Create a pie chart to visualize the types of drinks along with their
  caffeine content. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight the drink types,
  volumes (ml), calories, and caffeine amounts. Additionally, use highlights to emphasize
  the drinks with the highest caffeine content. Purpose: Helping viewers quickly identify
  caffeine-rich beverages from the dataset. Ensure the annotations and highlights
  draw attention to key elements in the pie chart, aiding in better understanding
  and comparison. The practical purpose is to offer a clear visual representation
  of caffeine content across various types of drinks for informed decision-making.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart sections?

  2. Would you like a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Should the text annotations be displayed inside or outside of the pie chart sections?

  4. Do you wish to use specific symbols or icons to represent different types of
  drinks in the annotations?

  5. Are there any specific thresholds for highlighting beverages with high caffeine
  content, or should we automatically highlight the top three?

  6. Should the calories and volume be displayed in a specific format (e.g., "ml"
  for volume, "kcal" for calories)?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the slices in the pie chart (e.g., descending
  order of caffeine content)?

  8. Are there any specific layout preferences for how the data-driven annotations
  and highlights should be presented?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Inside the pie chart sections would be fine.

  5. Please automatically highlight the top three beverages with the highest caffeine
  content.

  6. Yes, please display volume as "ml" and calories as "kcal".

  7. Yes, I prefer descending order of caffeine content.
