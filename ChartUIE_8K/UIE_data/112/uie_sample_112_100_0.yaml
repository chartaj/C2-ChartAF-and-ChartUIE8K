  Create a heatmap to visualize the Caffeine Content of Drinks dataset with annotations
  highlighting specific values like high caffeine content drinks. Use color gradients
  to indicate varying caffeine levels across different drinks and types. Annotate
  notable data points to focus on specific drinks, such as those with extremely high
  or low caffeine levels. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret, helping viewers quickly
  identify patterns and outliers in caffeine content across drink categories.

questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for indicating varying caffeine
  levels?

  2. Would you like specific threshold levels to define high and low caffeine content,
  or should these be dynamically determined based on the dataset?

  3. Are there any particular colors you want for annotating notable data points,
  such as extremely high or low caffeine levels?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the annotations?

  5. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient for caffeine
  levels?

  6. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap, such as vertical
  or horizontal?

  7. Are there any other specific drinks or types that you would like to highlight
  besides those with extreme caffeine levels?

  8. Would you like to include labels or tooltips for additional information about
  each drink?

  9. Do you have preferences for the overall aesthetic or design style of the heatmap
  (e.g., minimalist, detailed, etc.)?

  10. Should we include grid lines or borders to separate different drink categories
  more clearly?'
