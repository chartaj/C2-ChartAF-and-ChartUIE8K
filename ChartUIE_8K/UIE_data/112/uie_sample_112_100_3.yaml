initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot that visualizes the caffeine content
  of different drinks. On the X-axis, plot the Volume (ml) of the drinks, and on the
  Y-axis, plot the Caffeine (mg). Differentiate the points by color according to the
  type of drink (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Energy Drink, etc.). This will help visualize
  the relationship between drink volume and caffeine content across various drink
  types. Also, label each point with the drink name for better clarity. Include a
  legend to identify drink types by color. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors for differentiating
  the drink types?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the labels of each point (i.e., drink
  names)?

  3. Would you like grid lines on the plot? If yes, would you prefer them to be light
  or bold?

  4. Do you have a preference for the shape of the points (e.g., circle, square) on
  the scatter plot?

  5. Should the legend follow a particular style or format?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette, please choose
  what you think works best.

  2. I am not sure about the font style and size; please use a clear and readable
  option.

  3. I am not sure about the grid lines, please use your best judgment.

  4. I do not know about the shape of the points; any standard shape like circles
  would be fine.

  5. I have no specific preference for the legend style, please follow a standard
  format that is easy to understand.'
