initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the distribution of caffeine content
  in drinks. The data has columns for drink names, volumes in ml, calories, caffeine
  in mg, and types of drinks. I want to see the frequency of drinks by their caffeine
  content. This is for a food and drink analysis, so make sure to highlight different
  types of drinks if possible. The histogram should help identify how many drinks
  fall into various ranges of caffeine content. Ensure the chart is easy to understand,
  with clear labels and legend if needed.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different drink
  types?

  2. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for the histogram?

  3. What range intervals would you like to use for caffeine content bins?

  4. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be included in the histogram?

  6. How would you like the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  7. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and legend?

  8. Should any specific types of drinks be highlighted or emphasized more than others?

  9. Are there any specific titles or subtitles you want to include on the chart?

  10. Should the histogram include any annotations or additional information on specific
  data points?'
answers: "1. I do not have a specific preference. \n2. Vertical bars would be preferred.\n\
  3. I am not sure, can you suggest a range that makes sense for the data?\n4. I do\
  \ not know, please position it where it is most readable.\n5. Yes, including gridlines\
  \ would be helpful.\n6. I am not sure, but it should be clear what the axes represent.\n\
  7. I do not have a specific preference. \n8. No specific types need to be emphasized\
  \ more than others.\n9. The title could be \"Distribution of Caffeine Content in\
  \ Drinks\".\n10. I do not think additional annotations are necessary."
