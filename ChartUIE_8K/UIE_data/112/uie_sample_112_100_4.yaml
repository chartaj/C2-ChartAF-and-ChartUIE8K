initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the caffeine content in various drink
  types. Use data from the CSV to plot 'Volume (ml)' on the x-axis and 'Caffeine (mg)'
  on the y-axis. Different lines should represent different 'type' categories like
  Coffee, Tea, etc. Ensure that the legend clearly indicates each drink type. Highlight
  significant values for each type.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different drink type lines?

  2. How would you prefer significant values to be highlighted, for example, using
  markers or annotations?

  3. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for better readability of values?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the chart?

  6. Do you have any preference for the range and intervals of the x-axis (Volume
  in ml) and y-axis (Caffeine in mg)?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a trendline for each drink type?

  8. Is there a preferred position for the legend on the chart (e.g., right, top,
  bottom)?'
