initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the caffeine content (mg) of
  various drink types from the given dataset. Ensure the x-axis represents the different
  types of drinks (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Energy Drinks) and the y-axis shows the caffeine
  content in milligrams. This will help compare the caffeine distribution across different
  types. Use the sample data to identify unique drink types and their caffeine levels.
  Make sure the chart clearly shows the range, median, quartiles, and any outliers
  for each drink type. This will be useful for a quick visual comparison. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you prefer for each drink type?

  2. Would you like labels showing the median values on each box?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for the outliers (e.g., red dots, different shapes)?

  4. How would you like the quartiles to be displayed (e.g., solid lines, different
  shades)?

  5. Would you prefer the x-axis labels (drink types) to be rotated for better visibility?

  6. Should there be grid lines on the chart? If so, both major and minor or only
  major?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis titles and labels?

  8. Is there any specific range for the y-axis you would like to set, or should it
  be auto-scaled?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include labels showing the median values on each box.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Different shades would be nice to differentiate the quartiles.

  5. Yes, please rotate the x-axis labels for better visibility.

  6. Only major grid lines, please.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Auto-scaled would be best.
