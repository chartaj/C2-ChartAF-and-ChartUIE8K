  Create a bar chart to visualize the caffeine content of different drinks. Highlight
  the drinks with the highest and lowest caffeine levels. Annotate the caffeine content
  values directly on the bars for clarity. Use different colors to distinguish between
  types of drinks (e.g., coffee, tea). Ensure the chart is easy to read and clearly
  shows the distribution of caffeine content among various drink types to help viewers
  quickly understand the data. Title the chart "Caffeine Content of Drinks" for context.
