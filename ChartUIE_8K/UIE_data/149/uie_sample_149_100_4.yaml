initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the distribution of token counts for
  various authors and titles in the Colonia Corpus of Historical Portuguese (literature-and-linguistics).
  The x-axis should represent the unique authors and the y-axis should represent the
  unique titles. Use a color gradient to depict the range of token counts. Ensure
  that missing values, if any, are appropriately handled or highlighted. This will
  help me identify patterns or anomalies in token distribution across different works
  and authors from the 16th Century subcorpus. Do include labels for easier interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color gradient for the heatmap to represent
  the token counts?

  2. Should the chart include any specific title and subtitle?

  3. Are there any specific font preferences for labels and axes?

  4. How would you like missing values to be visually represented or highlighted on
  the heatmap?

  5. Do you want grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  6. Should the color gradient scale be labeled with the token count range?

  7. Do you have specific preferences for the orientation of axis labels (horizontal/vertical)?

  8. Would you like to include any specific annotations or notes on the heatmap?'
