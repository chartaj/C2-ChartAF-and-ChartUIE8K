initial_prompt: I have a dataset representing literary works from the 16th Century.
  I want to visualize the number of tokens (word count) across different authors and
  their works over time. Please create a line chart that shows the trends in the number
  of tokens for each author from the provided data. The x-axis should represent the
  years, the y-axis should represent the number of tokens, and each line in the chart
  should represent a different author. This will help in exploring the variations
  in literary productivity over the years. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different authors'' lines?

  2. Would you like to include data markers on the lines to highlight specific data
  points?

  3. Do you prefer a specific type of line (e.g., solid, dashed) for the different
  authors?

  4. Should there be a legend to identify each author, and if so, where would you
  prefer the legend to be positioned?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like gridlines in the chart for better readability, and if so, should
  they be in both directions (x and y axis)?

  7. Do you want any annotations or labels for particular years or token counts on
  the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or automatically adjust based on
  the data?

  9. Are there any specific years or authors you would like to highlight in the visualization?

  10. Do you prefer the lines to be smooth (curved) or straight (linear)?'
