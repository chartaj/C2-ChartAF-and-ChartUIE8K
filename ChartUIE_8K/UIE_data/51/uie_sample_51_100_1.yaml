initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the Microsoft stock data highlighting
  the stock price trends over time. Use color variations to represent the intensity
  of 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close', 'Adj Close', and 'Volume'. Add text annotations
  to specific dates where significant changes occurred to pinpoint critical events.
  Emphasize high and low extremes in stock prices to attract attention. This visualization
  aims to provide a clear, visual summary of stock market trends and help in understanding
  historical stock performance. This will be instrumental for financial analytics
  and decision-making in the technology sector.

  colors, markers)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the overall background color of the heatmap?

  5. Should the dates be displayed as specific intervals or as continuous time series?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations
  and labels?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included in the heatmap for better readability?

  8. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color intensities for each
  attribute?

  9. Are there any specific events or dates that you already know should be highlighted?

  10. Do you prefer the heatmap to be oriented vertically or horizontally for better
  readability?'
