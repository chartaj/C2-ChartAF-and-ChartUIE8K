initial_prompt: Please create a line chart for Microsoft Stocks showcasing the stock
  performance over time. Use the 'Date' for the x-axis as it will represent the timeline,
  and plot 'Open', 'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices on the y-axis to show the stock
  fluctuations. Ensure that each line is clearly distinguishable with a legend for
  clarity. Highlight any significant volume changes if possible. This will help in
  visualizing how the stock prices have varied daily and identify any patterns over
  the given period. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  ''Open'', ''High'', ''Low'', and ''Close'' prices?

  2. Would you like any annotations on specific data points such as peaks, troughs,
  or significant changes?

  3. Do you prefer a specific style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges you want to focus on?

  6. How would you prefer the volume changes to be highlighted (e.g., with bars, color
  changes, separate line)?
