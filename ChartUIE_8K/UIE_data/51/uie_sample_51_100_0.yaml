initial_prompt: I need a box chart for visualizing Microsoft's stock data over time.
  The chart should display the distribution of daily "Close" prices, with annotations
  highlighting significant high and low points. Additionally, use text annotations
  to label the highest and lowest closing prices, drawing attention to these values.
  The goal is to quickly identify trends and outliers in the stock's performance.
  Highlights can be used to mark significant months or years, emphasizing periods
  of notable activity or change in stock prices. Ensure it is engaging and informative
  for financial analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme or palette preference for highlighting
  significant months or years?

  2. How would you like the significant high and low points to be annotated (e.g.,
  specific shapes, colors, or text styles)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular layout for the box chart (e.g., vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Is there a specific time range you would like to focus on within the data?

  5. Would you like the box chart to include grid lines for easier reference, and
  if so, what type of grid lines (e.g., dotted, solid)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text annotations?

  7. Would you like any additional statistical markers (e.g., mean or median lines)
  to be included in the chart?

  8. How would you like the axis labels and titles to be formatted (e.g., font size,
  orientation)?'
