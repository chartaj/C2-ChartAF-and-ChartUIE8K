2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart to visualize the percent change in consumer spending across different
  categories for various state FIPS codes on specific dates. The x-axis should represent
  the categories, including All Merchant Category Codes, ACF, AER, GEN and AAP, GRF,
  HCS, TWS, and retail spending both including and excluding grocery. The y-axis should
  show the percent change in spending. Use text annotations to highlight the values
  for each bar, emphasizing those with significant changes. Highlight bars with extreme
  values in different colors. Ensure the chart effectively communicates spending trends
  across categories.
