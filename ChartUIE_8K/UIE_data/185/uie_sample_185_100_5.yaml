initial_prompt: Using the dataset on the percent change in consumer spending, create
  a choropleth map showing the state-wise variation in spending changes for different
  categories. Use the 'State FIPS code' as the geographical identifier, and visualize
  categories like 'Accommodation and food service (ACF) spending', 'Arts, entertainment,
  and recreation (AER) spending', and 'Grocery and food store (GRF) spending'. Each
  state should be color-coded based on spending change percentages. Tooltips should
  provide detailed information for each state, such as exact percent changes for all
  listed categories. Ensure the map is easy to read with a clear legend.

  map?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style or format for the map legend?

  4. Would you like any specific labeling or annotations on the map?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for labels and tooltips?

  6. Do you have any requirements for the map''s background and borders?
