  categories over time. Use the "Date" column for the x-axis and different spending
  categories like "Accommodation and food service", "Arts, entertainment, and recreation",
  "General merchandise stores and apparel and accessories", "Grocery and food store",
  and "Health care and social assistance" for the y-axis. Plot separate lines for
