initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the percent change in consumer
  spending from the dataset. Use "Date" as the x-axis to show the timeline and "All
  merchant category codes spending" as the y-axis to display the spending changes.
  Include different colors or markers for various "State FIPS codes" to distinguish
  the data points from different regions. Add titles and labels for better clarity.
  Make sure to highlight significant trends or anomalies in the consumer spending
  patterns over time. This will help analyze the impact of economic events on various
  states. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  distinguish different State FIPS codes?

  2. Would you prefer a title for the scatter plot? If so, what should it be?

  3. Are there any specific trends or anomalies that you already know about that you
  want to highlight?

  4. Do you want specific annotations or callouts for significant data points on the
  scatter plot?

  5. Is there a preferred style for the markers (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)
  representing different State FIPS codes?

  6. Do you prioritize displaying data labels for the axes in a particular format
  (e.g., dates in ''MM/DD/YYYY'' format)?

  7. Would you like a legend included to explain the colors/markers used for different
  State FIPS codes?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the gridlines (e.g., should they be
  more prominent or subtle)?

  9. Are there any additional contextual elements or notes you would like to see on
  the chart?'
