initial_prompt: I want a visualization that highlights key aspects of the online courses
  provided by Harvard and MIT. Specifically, create a box plot chart comparing the
  percentage of participants who audited (>50% course content accessed), got certified,
  and played video across different courses. Include data annotations for median values
  and highlight courses with high certification rates. This will help understand the
  engagement and success rates of various courses. Use color to distinguish between
  auditing, certification, and video-playing percentages. The goal is to visually
  assess which courses have higher engagement and certification rates.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between\
  \ auditing, certification, and video-playing percentages?\n2. Would you like the\
  \ courses with high certification rates to be highlighted using a specific color\
  \ or pattern?\n3. How would you prefer the median values to be annotated on the\
  \ box plot (e.g., with labels, lines, or markers)?\n4. Is there a particular font\
  \ style or size you would prefer for the annotations and labels on the chart?\n\
  5. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis titles?\n6. Would you\
  \ like grid lines to be included or excluded in the background of the box plot?\
  \ \n7. Is there a specific way you would like the legend to be displayed (e.g.,\
  \ position, style)?\n8. Do you have any preferences for the overall layout or size\
  \ of the chart?\n9. Are there any additional details or elements you would like\
  \ to be included in the chart for better understanding?"
