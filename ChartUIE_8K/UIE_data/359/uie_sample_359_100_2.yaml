initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing the participants who accessed
  course content against those who audited more than 50% of the content. Highlight
  courses with a certification rate above 10% using a different color. Include text
  annotations for the courses "Circuits and Electronics," "Introduction to Computer
  Science and Programming," and "Introduction to Solid State Chemistry" showing the
  exact number of participants and the percentage certified. This visualization should
  help analyze participation and certification patterns in online courses offered
  by Harvard and MIT.
