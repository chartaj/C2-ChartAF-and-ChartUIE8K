initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for the dataset titled "Online Courses from Harvard
  and MIT". The heatmap should visualize the correlation between various course metrics
  such as '% Audited', '% Certified', '% Played Video', '% Posted in Forum', and '%
  Grade Higher Than Zero'. Use shades of color to represent the strength of correlations,
  with darker shades indicating higher correlations and lighter shades indicating
  lower correlations. Label the axes with the course metrics, and include a color
  legend for clarity. This will help in understanding the relationships between different
  engagement and performance metrics for the online courses.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like a specific range for the correlation values to be highlighted?

  3. Would you prefer the colors to be sequential or diverging?

  4. Is there a particular format you would like for the axis labels (e.g., font size,
  bold)?

  5. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Would you like any annotations on the heatmap cells to indicate the correlation
  values numerically?

  7. Do you prefer the heatmap to be shown with or without spacing between the cells?

  8. Are there any specific stylistic preferences for the color legend (e.g., position,
  size, title)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the heatmap''s overall size or aspect ratio?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Font size should be readable but I have no specific preference for bold.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  6. Yes, I would like annotations on the heatmap cells to indicate the correlation
  values numerically.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I do not know.'
