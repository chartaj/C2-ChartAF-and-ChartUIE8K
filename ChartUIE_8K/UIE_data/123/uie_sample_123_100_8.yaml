initial_prompt: I'd like a column chart visualizing the Period against the Price,
  with additional color coding for the 'Number' category. The 'Color' should be represented
  as different colored columns to make it more visually appealing. It's related to
  arts and entertainment, so it should be engaging and colorful, reflecting the different
  'Color' values distinctly. Please include the top three Periods by Price to keep
  it concise and clear. Lastly, ensure the chart has a clear legend, labeled axes,
  and a suitable title that ties it to entertainment economics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to represent
  each ''Color'' category in the chart?

  2. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the chart title and axis
  labels?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart? If yes, should they be
  for both axes or just one (X-axis or Y-axis)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart''s overall background color?

  5. Are there any specific styles or effects you''d like to be applied to the columns
  (e.g., shading, gradient)?

  6. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  7. Do you want the axis labels to be rotated for better visibility, especially if
  the periods are long?

  8. Should the columns have data labels showing the exact Price values at the top?'
