initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the provided dataset, focusing on the
  "Price" on the Y-axis and "Period" on the X-axis. Highlight points by "Color" to
  distinguish different groups visually. Use shapes such as circles for data points
  and consider adding annotations to emphasize trends or special values. This chart
  will help in visualizing how the price changes over different periods and identifying
  any patterns associated with specific colors in an arts-and-entertainment context.
  Aim for clarity and ease of interpreting trends at a glance.
