initial_prompt: I need a bar chart to visualize the data from `../Extra_datas/data/123.csv`.
  Please show the counts of unique values for the 'Number' column. Use different colors
  for each bar to distinguish them easily. Also, indicate the period with relevant
  labels. The data is related to win-go color predictions, part of arts and entertainment.
  Ensure the chart is clear and easily understandable, as it will be part of a performance
  prediction analysis. Add proper titles and labels for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the bar chart?

  2. What label do you prefer for the x-axis?

  3. What label do you prefer for the y-axis?

  4. Do you have any preferred colors for the different bars?

  5. Should the bars be ordered in a specific way (e.g., ascending or descending)?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for labels and titles?

  7. Should the chart include a legend?

  8. What level of detail should be shown for the period labels (e.g., full date,
  year, etc.)?

  9. Is there any additional text or annotations you would like to include in the
  chart?

  10. Would you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the chart?'
