initial_prompt: '<start of instructions>

  Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the data columns such as Period, Price,
  and Number. Use different colors for the Price and Number in each bar that represent
  Period values. Add Highlights where the price is more than 86000 to stand out in
  red and use Shapes like arrows to point significant periods. This is important for
  predicting trends over time in the dataset for arts and entertainment and for facilitating
  color prediction analysis by highlighting variations and trends. Ensure the chart
  is visually intuitive and emphasizes critical data points for analysis.
