  for arts and entertainment. Use highlights to emphasize 'Red'. Add shapes to show
  trends in 'Price' over 'Period'. Ensure all annotations are included.

  other than ''Red''?

  2. What specific shapes do you prefer to use for showing trends in ''Price'' over
  ''Period''?

  3. How would you like the ''Red'' color to be highlighted in the donut chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the layout and positioning of annotations on
  the chart?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the axes scale and labels on the trend
  chart?'

  thicker border.
