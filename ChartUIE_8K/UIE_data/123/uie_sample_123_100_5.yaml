initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the data from '123.csv'. The
  chart should show the trend of 'Price' over 'Period'. We are particularly interested
  in breaking down the data by the 'Color' attribute to see the performance of different
  colors over time. Additionally, highlight any visible trends in the 'Number' column.
  This will help us in our analysis for the Win-Go, Color_Prediction project in the
  arts-and-entertainment sector. Make sure the chart is clearly labeled and easy to
  interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different ''Color''
  categories?

  2. Would you like the ''Number'' column to be represented as an additional line
  on the chart or as a secondary visualization element like a bar or mark?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labels or annotations to be included on the chart
  for key data points?

  4. Are there any specific formatting requirements for the axes (e.g., date format
  for ''Period'' or currency format for ''Price'')?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between different ''Color''
  categories?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  8. Do you want to include any reference lines or markers for specific threshold
  values in ''Price'' or ''Number''?

  9. Do you have any specific preferences for the size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  10. Would you like to include tooltips or hover effects to display additional data
