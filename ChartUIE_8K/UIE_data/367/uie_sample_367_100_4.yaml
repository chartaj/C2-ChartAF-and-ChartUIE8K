initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap showcasing the distribution of
  Netflix movies and TV shows by country. Highlight countries with a higher concentration
  of titles, differentiating between movies and TV shows. I'd like the map to use
  color gradients to represent the number of titles available in each country. Additionally,
  include interactive features to display more details about the count and type of
  shows available per country when hovering over each region. This visualization should
  help in understanding global content distribution on Netflix.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for representing the
  number of titles?

  2. Would you prefer any particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  3. Should the map include labels for each country or region?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme to differentiate between movies
  and TV shows?

  5. Are there any specific countries or regions you want to prioritize or highlight
  on the map?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or keys on the map to explain the color
  gradients?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the size or resolution of the map?'
