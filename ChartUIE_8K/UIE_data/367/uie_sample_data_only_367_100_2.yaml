09_answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe highlight the release years with the most entries.

  3. I am not sure about the annotation style.

  4. Different color would be fine for highlighting missing values.

  5. Yes, please include a legend indicating the release years.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I do not have a preference for fonts or font sizes.

  8. Please include a title like "Netflix Movies and TV Shows by Release Year" and
