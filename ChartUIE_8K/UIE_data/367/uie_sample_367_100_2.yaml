initial_prompt: Visualize Netflix Movies and TV Shows data using a stacked bar chart.
  The x-axis should display types (Movies and TV Shows), while the y-axis should represent
  the number of entries. Stack bars by release year to show the distribution over
  time. Annotate significant data points and use highlights for missing values. This
  will help identify trends and gaps in the dataset for analysis.

  labels)?

  4. How would you like missing values to be highlighted (e.g. different color, pattern,
  or marker)?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to have a legend indicating the release years?

  6. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart''s text elements
  (titles, labels, annotations)?

  8. Should the chart include any specific titles or subtitles?

  9. What level of detail do you expect for the axis labels (e.g. full years, abbreviated
