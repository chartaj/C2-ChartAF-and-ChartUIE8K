  TV shows by release year from the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset. The x-axis
  should show release years, and the y-axis should represent the count of titles released
  in each year. The histogram should have separate color bars for 'Movies' and 'TV
  Shows' to distinguish between the two types. This will help understand trends in
  the number of releases over different years.

  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
