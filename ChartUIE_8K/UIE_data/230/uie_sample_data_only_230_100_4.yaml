02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset on salary based on years of experience. Please
  create a histogram that shows the distribution of salaries. I want to see how salaries
  are spread across different ranges and also identify if there are common salary
  bands. This will help in understanding the most frequent salary ranges in the dataset.
  Make sure the bins are appropriately sized for clarity. Display the salary on the
  x-axis and the frequency on the y-axis. Also, include any necessary labels for better
  readability and understanding. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
