initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart showcasing the YearsExperience on the x-axis
  and Salary on the y-axis. Use bubble size to represent the number of occurrences
  for each data point. Add text annotations to highlight the highest and lowest salaries.
  Use highlights to emphasize the average salary range. The chart should help visualize
  the relationship between experience and salary, showing the trend and any outliers.
  This will aid in understanding how salary scales with years of experience. Employ
  non-data-driven annotations for context about significant points like industry averages
  or key observations.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer for the bubbles and highlights?

  2. How would you like the average salary range to be visually represented (e.g.,
  shaded area, different color bubbles)?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the annotations?

  4. Are there any specific industry averages or key observations you would like to
  include as non-data-driven annotations?

  5. How detailed do you want the annotations for the highest and lowest salaries
  to be?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If so, in which color?

  7. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the x-axis (YearsExperience)
  and y-axis (Salary) labels?

  8. Do you have a preference for the opacity of the bubbles to better visualize overlapping
  data points?

  9. Do you want to include a legend to explain the representation of bubble sizes
  and other highlights?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want the x-axis or y-axis to be
  set to?'
