initial_prompt: I have a dataset on salary based on years of experience. Please create
  a histogram that shows the distribution of salaries. I want to see how salaries
  are spread across different ranges and also identify if there are common salary
  bands. This will help in understanding the most frequent salary ranges in the dataset.
  Make sure the bins are appropriately sized for clarity. Display the salary on the
  x-axis and the frequency on the y-axis. Also, include any necessary labels for better
  readability and understanding. Thank you!
questions: '1. What is the preferred number of bins for the histogram, or should we
  use an optimal bin size algorithm?

  2. Do you have specific ranges for the salary bands that you would like to use for
  the bins?

  3. What color palette would you prefer for the histogram bars?

  4. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to be included on
  the axes or within the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and titles?

  7. Should grid lines be included in the histogram for better readability?

  8. Do you want to display any additional statistical information such as mean or
  median salary on the chart?

  9. Is there a specific format or style guide that we should follow to align with
  your organizationâ€™s branding?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, please use an optimal bin size algorithm.

  2. I do not have specific ranges for the salary bands.

  3. I do not know, please use a standard color palette.

  4. I would like a title for the histogram. It should be "Salary Distribution by
  Years of Experience".

  5. Include labels on the x-axis as "Salary" and on the y-axis as "Frequency".

  6. I do not have a preference for the font style and size.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No specific format or style guide needed.'
