2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a column chart to visualize the Salary Dataset focusing on the relationship
  between YearsExperience and Salary. Highlight specific data points to emphasize
  differences in salaries based on years of experience. Add text annotations to notable
  data points to draw attention to key values and trends. Ensure the chart is visually
  engaging to aid in understanding the linear regression analysis. Include minimal
  context annotations to explain the data visualization's purpose and aim for clarity
  in comparing the salary growth trends relative to years of experience. This will
  help illustrate the dataset effectively for analysis.
