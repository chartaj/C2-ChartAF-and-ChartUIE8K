2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique values in the YearsExperience
  and Salary columns from the given dataset. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight
  specific segments, displaying their corresponding values in the chart. For example,
  annotate slices showing unique salary values or experience lengths. Highlight the
  segments with the most and least unique values to emphasize their importance visually.
  This will help viewers quickly identify key data points and understand data distribution
  patterns effectively. The purpose is to focus attention on significant statistical
  elements in a simple linear regression context.
