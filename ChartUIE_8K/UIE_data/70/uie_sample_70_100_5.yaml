initial_prompt: I want to visualize the stock data of Google (GOOG) using a heatmap.
  The heatmap should show variations in the stock prices across different dates. Use
  the columns "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", and "Adj Close" as the metrics for the
  heatmap, with dates on one axis and the different metrics on the other. The color
  intensity should indicate the value of the stock prices, allowing me to easily spot
  trends or anomalies. Remember to include a legend to interpret the color intensities.
  The x-axis could be the "Date" and the y-axis could represent each stock price metric.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How detailed do you want the date axis to be (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  3. Is there a particular range of dates you are interested in?

  4. Do you want to add labels for extreme values or anomalies on the heatmap?

  5. Is there a specific font size or style you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the heatmap?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the legend placement?

  8. Are there any specific thresholds you want to highlight with distinct colors?'

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.
