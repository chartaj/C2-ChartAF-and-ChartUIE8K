initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of the daily trading
  volumes for the Google (GOOG) stock data. Use the "Volume" column from the provided
  dataset to plot the frequency of different volume ranges. Display the X-axis with
  volume ranges and the Y-axis with the frequency of days that fall into each range.

  that references Google stock trading volumes. This will help in analyzing trading
  activity patterns over time.
