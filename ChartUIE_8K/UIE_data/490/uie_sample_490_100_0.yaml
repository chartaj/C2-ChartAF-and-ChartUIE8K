initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the 'LCA_Category_sub' vs 'FAO
  Match' data from the fish_matching dataset in the zoology context. Highlight the
  missing 'Gephart Match' values and use text annotations to display the unique 'FAO
  Match' categories. This chart aims to spotlight how different subcategories of captured
  fish align with FAO designations, focusing attention on patterns or discrepancies
  within the dataset. Use colors to differentiate between 'LCA_Category_sub' entries
  and emphasize those with missing 'Gephart Match' data for better visual clarity
  and analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for differentiating ''LCA_Category_sub''
  entries?

  2. Would you like a particular color to be used to highlight the missing ''Gephart
  Match'' values?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations for ''FAO Match'' categories to be
  displayed (e.g., font size, orientation)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be
  positioned on the chart?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like for the ''LCA_Category_sub'' entries
  in the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the gridlines or background of the chart?

  8. Do you want the values to be displayed on top of the columns in the chart?

  9. Would you prefer any specific chart dimensions or aspect ratios?

  10. Any additional elements or annotations you would like to include on the chart
  for better understanding?'
