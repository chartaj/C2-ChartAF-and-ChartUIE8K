2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a column chart to visualize the 'LCA_Category_sub' vs 'FAO Match' data from
  the fish_matching dataset in the zoology context. Highlight the missing 'Gephart
  Match' values and use text annotations to display the unique 'FAO Match' categories.
  This chart aims to spotlight how different subcategories of captured fish align
  with FAO designations, focusing attention on patterns or discrepancies within the
  dataset. Use colors to differentiate between 'LCA_Category_sub' entries and emphasize
  those with missing 'Gephart Match' data for better visual clarity and analysis.
