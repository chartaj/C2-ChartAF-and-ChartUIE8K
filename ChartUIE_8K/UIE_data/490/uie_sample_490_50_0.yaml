initial_prompt: Create a column chart showing the count of unique values for each
  "LCA_Category_sub" under "Fish (capture)" category, highlighting missing values
  in "Gephart Match" with a different color. Add descriptive text annotations to the

  gaps essential for fish matching studies.

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the text annotations?
