initial_prompt: I have sales data for a superstore that includes information like
  order dates, ship modes, customer demographics, and sales figures. Can you create
  a histogram visualizing the distribution of sales figures? I want to see how sales
  are spread out across different ranges, which would help in understanding the revenue
  distribution. Also, please make sure to highlight the frequency of different sales
  amounts so that it's clear where the majority of sales fall. Use appropriate bin
  sizes to make the data easy to interpret at a glance. Thank you!
questions: '1. What bin size would you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histogram bars?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  4. Are there any specific ranges of sales you would like to highlight with different
  colors or patterns?

  5. Is there a particular title you would like to use for the histogram?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the axis titles and labels?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines to help interpret the data more easily?

  8. Are there any legends or keys you would like to include in the chart?

  9. How would you like the frequency of sales amounts to be displayed or annotated
  on the chart?

  10. Would you prefer the chart to be horizontal or vertical?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the bin size.

  2. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  3. Yes, please include labels for the x-axis as "Sales Amount" and the y-axis as
  "Frequency".

  4. I am not sure about specific ranges to highlight.

  5. The title could be "Sales Distribution of Superstore".

  6. I do not have any specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  7. Yes, including gridlines would be helpful.

  8. I do not know about including a legend or key.
