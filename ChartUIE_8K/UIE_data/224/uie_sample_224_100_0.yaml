initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize sales by region. Group data
  by 'Category' and stack by 'Sub-Category'. Use different colors for each 'Sub-Category'.
  Include text annotations for the top 3 regions with highest sales per 'Category'
  to highlight these specific values. Apply highlights to the highest bar in each
  stack to easily identify peak sales. This chart will help visualize the distribution
  of sales across different regions and product categories, aiding in business decision-making.
  Ensure the annotations clearly display the sales figures and the corresponding region
  and category.

  ''Sub-Categories''?

  2. What font size and style would you prefer for the text annotations?

  3. Do you prefer a particular orientation for the bar chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. How should the highlights for the highest bar in each stack be represented (e.g.,
  different color, border, pattern)?

  5. Do you want to include a legend for the ''Sub-Category'' colors, and if so, where
  would you prefer it to be positioned?

  6. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the sales figures in the
  annotations (e.g., currency symbol, decimals)?
