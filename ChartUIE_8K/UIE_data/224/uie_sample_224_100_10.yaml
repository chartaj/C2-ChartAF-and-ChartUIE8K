initial_prompt: 'I''d like a pie chart visualizing the distribution of sales across
  different product categories in the Superstore Sales Dataset. The chart should show
  proportions of total sales attributed to each category: Furniture, Office Supplies,
  and Technology. Please use the sample data to create this visualization. The chart
  should be clear, with each category distinctly colored and labeled with percentage
  values to easily understand the sales distribution. This visualization will help
  in analyzing which product categories generate the most revenue. Thank you!'
