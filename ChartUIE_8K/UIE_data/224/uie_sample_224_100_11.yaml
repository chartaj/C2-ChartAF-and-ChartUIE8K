initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize sales in the Superstore Sales Dataset.
  The x-axis should represent 'Order Date', and the y-axis should represent 'Sales'.
  Use different colors or markers to denote each 'Category' (e.g., Furniture, Office
  Supplies). Additionally, include a legend to differentiate between the categories.
  This plot will help to see the trend of sales over time across different categories.
  Make sure to label the axes, and provide a title for the scatter plot.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme used for different
  categories?

  3. Would you like to set a specific date format for the x-axis labels?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would prefer for the axes labels
  and title?

  5. Do you have a preference for the marker style (e.g., circle, square, triangle)
  to represent different categories?

  6. Would you like to include any gridlines or other background elements in the plot?

  7. Do you want to apply any specific filters or focus on a particular date range
  within the dataset?

  8. Should the plot include data points for all available sales, or are there particular
  sales ranges that should be highlighted or omitted?'
