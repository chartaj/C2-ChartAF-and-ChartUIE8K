initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the total sales per category
  segmented by region. Use data from the Superstore Sales Dataset. Each bar group
  should represent a category (e.g., Furniture, Office Supplies) and within each group,
  bars should represent different regions (e.g., South, West). Ensure the y-axis reflects
  sales amount.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different regions in the
  bar chart?

  2. Would you like to see gridlines in the background of the chart?

  3. How would you like the legend to be displayed, if at all (e.g., to the right
  of the chart, below the chart)?

  4. Is there a specific label format or font style you would prefer for the axes
  and legend?

  5. Do you want the bars to have specific spacing or width?

  6. Should the chart display the exact sales amounts on top of each bar?

  7. Do you want any specific category ordering within the groups?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If so, please specify the title text.

  9. Would you like to include any annotations or additional information within the
  chart?

  10. Is there a specific layout for the bar groups you have in mind (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical grouping)?'
