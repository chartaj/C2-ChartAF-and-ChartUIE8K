initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot to visualize the "NIFTY-50 Stocks Dataset."
  Use the 'Symbol' on the x-axis and the '% Chng' on the y-axis. Each dot should represent
  a stock, showing its percentage change. Use different colors for positive and negative
  changes. Include legends for clarity. Highlight data for 'ADANIPORTS', 'ASIANPAINT',
  and 'AXISBANK' to stand out. Include tooltips with details like 'Open', 'High',
  'Low', and 'LTP' values for interactivity. The title should read "NIFTY-50 Stocks
  Percentage Change Overview." Make it visually appealing and clear. Thank you!

  changes?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the chart?

  6. Should the axes have grid lines, and if so, what style do you prefer (e.g., dashed,
  solid)?

  7. What marker style do you prefer for the dots (e.g., circles, squares, triangles)?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for axis scaling (e.g., logarithmic scale,
  linear scale)?

  9. Should the axis labels be rotated or angled for better readability? If yes, specify
  the angle.
