initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the NIFTY-50 stocks dataset. On the x-axis,
  have the '52w H' (52-week high) and on the y-axis, plot the '% Chng' (percentage
  change). Make each point represent one stock symbol from the dataset. Include distinct
  colors for each point and add labels to denote the stock symbols. It would be great
  if the plot also highlights the trend or correlation between the 52-week high and
  the percentage change. This will help visualize the stock performance relative to
  their one-year high values.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct points
  representing each stock symbol?

  2. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the stock symbol labels?

  3. Do you have a preferred layout or size for the chart (e.g., square, widescreen)?

  4. Should the trend or correlation be shown using a specific type of line (e.g.,
  linear trend line, polynomial curve)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the background color or grid style of the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any specific titles for the x-axis and y-axis, or should
  they just be ''52w H'' and ''% Chng''?

  7. Do you require any specific legend format or positioning on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to include to highlight
  certain stocks or data points?

  9. Do you have a preferred style for dot shapes (e.g., circles, squares) on the
  scatter plot?

  10. Should the axes have specific limits or range of values, or should they be set
  automatically based on the data?'
