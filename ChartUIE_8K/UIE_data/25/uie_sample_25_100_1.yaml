initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the NIFTY-50 Stocks Dataset,
  focusing on columns like 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'LTP', and '% Chng'. Annotate key
  statistics such as median, Q1, Q3, and any outliers. Highlight significant changes
  in '% Chng' and 'Volume (lacs)'. The purpose is to provide a quick comparison of
  stock performance over the dataset period, emphasizing stocks with the most notable
  changes. Include text annotations for highest and lowest values and use highlights
  to mark stocks with significant trading volume or extreme price changes. This will
  help analyze trends and spot key movers.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart and highlights?

  2. Do you have a preference for the overall style of the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, etc.)?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading to help with readability?

  4. Do you have any specific format for text annotations (e.g., font type, size,
  color)?

  5. Do you want the chart to have a particular orientation (e.g., vertical or horizontal
  box plots)?

  6. Should the legend be included, and if so, do you have a preferred position for
  it on the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and titles (e.g., font
  type, size, color)?

  8. Is there a preferred format for displaying the statistical annotations (e.g.,
  medians, quartiles)?

  wording for them?
