  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Please label the axes clearly with "Year" on the horizontal axis and "Net Migration"
  on the vertical axis.

  4. Yes, gridlines would be helpful.

  5. Please include a note about historical contexts like political changes or economic
  factors influencing migration.

  6. Vertical bars would be preferred.

  7. No need for a legend.

  8. Title: "Net Migration in Central and Southern Asia (1955-1965)"

  9. No, an image will suffice.

  10. I have no specific preference.
