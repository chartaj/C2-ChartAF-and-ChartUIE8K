  Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the "Net migration" values
  over the years in the given dataset. Since the data spans various years and countries,
  it would be helpful to separate the histogram bars based on different decades (e.g.,
  1950s, 1960s). This way, we can observe the migration patterns across different
  time periods and understand any significant shifts or trends in migration flows.
  Ensure to label the x-axis with the decades and the y-axis with the frequency of
  the "Net migration" values to provide clear insights.
