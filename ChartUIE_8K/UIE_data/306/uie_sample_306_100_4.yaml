initial_prompt: I need a choropleth map visualizing the migration data over the years
  for various countries. Please use the "International immigrants (% population)"
  and "Asylum seekers by origin (per capita)" columns to depict migration trends.
  Show the percentage of international immigrants and asylum seekers per capita on
  the map using different shades to represent the values. Ensure that it is easy to
  distinguish between countries with high and low values. The time frame should be
  from 1955 to 1965. Label countries clearly, and include a legend for the data values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific color scales or color schemes
  for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like to use distinct color shades for "International immigrants (%
  population)" and "Asylum seekers by origin (per capita)" or prefer gradients?

  3. Do you have a preferred style for labeling the countries on the map (e.g., font
  size, type, or color)?

  4. Are there any specific thresholds or value ranges you would like highlighted
  in the legend?

  5. Would you like to add any additional annotations on the map to emphasize particular
  trends or data points?

  6. Do you prefer the map to display data in yearly increments or as an aggregated
  summary for the entire time frame from 1955 to 1965?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like the legend to be styled or positioned
  on the map?'
