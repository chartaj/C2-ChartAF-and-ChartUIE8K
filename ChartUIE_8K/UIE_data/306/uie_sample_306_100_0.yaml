initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the "Net migration" data for
  the years 1955, 1960, and 1965. Highlight the values with text annotations to emphasize
  the differences. Focus the viewerâ€™s attention on the changes over the years to understand
  migration trends in Central and Southern Asia. Add non-data-driven annotations if
  necessary to provide context or additional insights related to migration patterns.
  The purpose is to analyze net migration over time and its implications for the region.
  This visualization will help in understanding social science dynamics in migration.

  or horizontally)?
