initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the reign periods of Roman emperors
  from rise to fall. Use text annotations to display their names, causes of death,
  and unique notes for deeper context. Highlight the different causes of death using
  distinct colors. Ensure BCE dates are correctly shown as negative years. The purpose
  is to provide a clear timeline overview, emphasizing shifts in power and notable
  historical events. This chart will help viewers understand the succession and impact
  of these emperors in Roman history, highlighted through significant annotations
  and color-coded death causes.

  of death?

  4. Do you have a preference for the overall width and height of the chart?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for easier reading of the timeline?

  6. Do you have a preferred placement for the text annotations (e.g., above, below,
  or on the line)?

  7. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  8. Should negative BCE years be highlighted or formatted in any specific way?

  9. Would you prefer the chart background to be a specific color or texture?'
