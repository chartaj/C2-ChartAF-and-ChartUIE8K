initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the causes of death of the Roman
  Emperors listed in the data. Highlight sections representing "Assassination" as
  it seems to be a significant cause and provide data-driven annotations for each
  segment showing the number of emperors. This visualization should help emphasize
  the risks faced by these leaders. Include a title "Causes of Death of Roman Emperors"
  and a legend. Utilize the data details and ensure the chart is easy to interpret.
  Consider historical context and the implications of violent deaths in their governance.

  segment?

  2. Is there a specific font or style you would like for the chart title "Causes
  of Death of Roman Emperors"?

  they be randomly assigned?

  4. How detailed do you want the data-driven annotations for each segment (e.g.,
  just the number of emperors or additional contextual information)?

  5. Do you prefer a particular layout for the legend, such as positioned to the right,
  below, or within the pie chart?

  6. Are there any specific historical notes or context you would like included within
  the annotations or the chart itself?

  7. Would you like the chart to include any additional elements such as historical
  images or icons to enhance the visual appeal?

  8. Should the pie chart have a 2D or 3D design?'
