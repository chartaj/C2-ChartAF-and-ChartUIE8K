initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the number of unique values
  for each column in the dataset 'The Emperors of Rome.' Each column name should be
  listed on the x-axis, and the number of unique values should be displayed on the
  y-axis. Make sure to highlight any columns with significant numbers of unique values
  compared to others. This visualization will help understand the variability of each
  attribute in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars in the column
  chart?

  2. How would you like the columns with significant numbers of unique values to be
  highlighted? (e.g., different color, bold outline, etc.)

  3. Would you like to set a specific threshold for what constitutes a ''significant''
  number of unique values?

  4. Do you want to include data labels displaying the exact number of unique values
  on top of each bar?

  5. What title would you prefer for this column chart?

  6. Should we include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?

  8. Would you like to display any additional annotations or notes on the chart?
