initial_prompt: Visualize the median environmental impact of different fish taxa from
  aquaculture. Use a bar chart displaying 'taxa' on the x-axis and 'median' GHG emissions
  on the y-axis. Highlight the taxa with the highest and lowest median values. Add
  text annotations to display exact median values on the bars for these taxa. This
  will help identify which fish types have more or less environmental impact, guiding
  sustainable consumption decisions. Also, consider adding contextual annotations
  to explain 'GHG' emissions and why they are significant in aquaculture practices.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used in the chart?

  2. Would you like the highlighted taxa (highest and lowest median values) to have
  specific colors or styles?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations on the
  bars?

  4. Is there a particular position on the bars where you would like the text annotations
  to be placed (e.g., top, center)?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better readability? If yes, specify
  horizontal, vertical, or both.

  6. Do you have any preference for the chart title or subtitle?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned?

  8. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the contextual annotations
  explaining ''GHG'' emissions?

  9. Would you like to include any specific labels or notes on the axes?

  10. Are there any additional elements you want to be included in the chart background
  or borders?'
