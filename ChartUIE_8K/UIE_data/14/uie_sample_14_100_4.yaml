initial_prompt: I want a line chart for visualizing the environmental impact of different
  fish species. Plot `median` values on the Y-axis and `taxa` on the X-axis. Use different
  colors for each `stressor` category. Include error bars to represent `lower_95`
  and `upper_95` values on the chart. Title the chart "Environmental Impact of Aquaculture
  by Species". Ensure the X-axis lists species names while the Y-axis shows the magnitude
  of the environmental impact. Please create this chart in a clear and easily understandable
  format for an amateur audience.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating between stressor
  categories?

  2. Would you like any specific labels or annotations on the chart to highlight key
  points or data?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for the error bars (e.g., capped lines, shadow
  areas)?

  4. Are there any specific font preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Do you have a preferred line style (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for the different
  species lines on the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the different stressor categories,
  and if so, do you have any placement preferences for it?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the grid lines on the chart (e.g., color,
  visibility)?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you would like for the chart?

  9. Would you like to include any additional descriptive text or notes on the chart
  for context?'
