initial_prompt: Create a line chart displaying 'median', 'lower_95', and 'upper_95'
  values on the Y-axis against different 'taxa' on the X-axis from the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Should we display data points for ''median'', ''lower_95'', and ''upper_95''
  on the lines?

  3. Do you want grid lines in the background of the chart?

  4. Would you prefer to label axes with their full titles or with abbreviated labels?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between ''median'', ''lower_95'',
  and ''upper_95''?

  6. Do you want to add a title to the chart? If so, what should it be?

  7. Should the X-axis (for ''taxa'') be sorted in any specific order?

  8. Would you like the chart to have any specific dimensions or aspect ratio?

  9. Do you have a preference for the font size and style of the axis labels?

  10. Should the Y-axis have a specific range, or should it be auto-scaled based on
  the data?'
