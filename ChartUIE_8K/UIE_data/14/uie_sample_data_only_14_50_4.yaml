  For data attributes needed in data visualization, store them in query[''Data Attribute''].
  Data attributes MUST match exactly the column names of the data.

  Store the selected task from the task types in query[''Task''].

  Store the purpose of visualization in query[''Purpose''].

  Store the prospective audience in query[''Audience''].

  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
