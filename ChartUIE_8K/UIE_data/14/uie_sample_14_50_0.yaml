initial_prompt: Create a box chart for the fish data showing the median, lower 95,
  and upper 95 bounds for GHG stressor by taxonomic groups on aquaculture. Highlight
  variance, emphasizing taxa with broader ranges and missing values. Include text
  annotations to note median values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. What style of text annotations would you like for the median values (e.g., font
  size, color, placement)?

  3. Would you like any specific highlighting technique for taxa with broader ranges
  (e.g., different shades, patterns)?

  4. How would you prefer us to indicate missing values on the chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Should the box chart include a legend explaining the different bounds?

  7. Is there a particular way you would like the data to be sorted or grouped on
  the x-axis?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s layout or dimensions?'
