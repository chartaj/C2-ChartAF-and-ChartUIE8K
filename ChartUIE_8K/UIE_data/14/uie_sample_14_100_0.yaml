initial_prompt: 'Create a box plot to visualize the distribution of ''median'' GHG
  emissions (median, lower_95, upper_95) for different ''taxa'' in aquaculture, grouped
  by ''full_taxa_name''. Highlight outliers and annotate medians for clarity. This
  will help us understand the impact of different fish types on greenhouse gas emissions
  in aquaculture production, which is relevant for sustainability assessments in zoology
  and environmental studies. Exclude ''Unnamed: 10'' and ''Unnamed: 11'' as they contain
  too many missing values. Use different colors for each ''taxa'' to improve visual
  distinction.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for different ''taxa'' to improve
  visual distinction?

  2. Would you like specific annotations for median values, and if so, how would you
  prefer them to be displayed (e.g., numeric labels, lines, etc.)?

  3. Are there specific outlier markers or symbols you prefer when highlighting outliers?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines, and if so, should they be major, minor, or
  both?

  5. Would you like a title and axis labels for the chart? If yes, please provide
  the preferred text.

  6. Should there be any specific legend placement or format for easy identification
  of the ''taxa''?

  7. Do you have a preferred format for data labels (e.g., decimal places, units)?

  8. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for annotations and labels?

  9. Would you like to include a confidence interval visualization (using ''lower_95''
  and ''upper_95'') on the box plot? If so, in which format?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Major gridlines would be helpful.

  5. Title: "Distribution of GHG Emissions by Taxa in Aquaculture"; X-axis: "Full
  Taxa Name"; Y-axis: "GHG Emissions (Median)"

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. Yes, please include a confidence interval visualization.'
