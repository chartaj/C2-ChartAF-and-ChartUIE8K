initial_prompt: I need an area chart displaying the Desktop Windows version market
  share from 2015 to 2019. Each year should be on the X-axis and the market share
  percentage on the Y-axis. Different colors should represent each Windows version
  (e.g., WinXP, Win7, Win8.1, etc.), so it's easy to distinguish them over the years.
  Make sure the chart is clear and shows trends over time. The chart should be more
  visual and less cluttered, emphasizing how each Windows version's market share changes.
  Include a legend for clarity and use a suitable title.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different Windows versions?

  2. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you would like to be used for the title,
  labels, and legend?

  3. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the legend?

  4. Do you want data labels to be displayed on the chart for the market share percentages?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the chart for better readability,
  and if so, horizontal, vertical, or both?

  6. Do you prefer a specific title for the chart, or should we use the one mentioned
  in your instruction?

  7. How would you like the X-axis and Y-axis to be formatted (e.g., specific intervals,
  labels rotation)?

  8. Are there any particular design elements or styles you want to avoid to reduce
  clutter?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about a specific color palette for the different Windows
  versions.

  2. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes for the title, labels,
  and legend.

  3. I am not sure about the style or format for the legend.

  4. I do not know if I want data labels to be displayed on the chart for the market
  share percentages.

  5. I would like grid lines to be visible on the chart, preferably both horizontal
  and vertical.

  6. Use the title: "Desktop Windows Version Market Share (2015-2019)."

  7. I prefer that the X-axis and Y-axis have readable intervals, but I have no specific
  preference for labels rotation.

  8. I would like to avoid overly complex or crowded design elements to reduce clutter.'
