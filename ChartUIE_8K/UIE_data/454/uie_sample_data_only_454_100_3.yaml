02_initial_prompt: I need an area chart displaying the Desktop Windows version market
  share from 2015 to 2019. Each year should be on the X-axis and the market share
  percentage on the Y-axis. Different colors should represent each Windows version
  (e.g., WinXP, Win7, Win8.1, etc.), so it's easy to distinguish them over the years.
  Make sure the chart is clear and shows trends over time. The chart should be more
  visual and less cluttered, emphasizing how each Windows version's market share changes.
  Include a legend for clarity and use a suitable title.
