initial_prompt: Please create a stacked area chart to visualize the Desktop Windows
  version market share from 2015 to 2019. Each area should represent a different Windows
  version (e.g., WinXP, Win7, Win8.1) and show how its market share has changed over
  these years. This visualization should effectively highlight the trend for each
  version over time, illustrating the overall market shifts. Use distinct colors to
  distinguish between the versions and make sure the chart has proper legends, axis
  labels, and a title for context. This will help in understanding the market dynamics
  in the technology sector.
