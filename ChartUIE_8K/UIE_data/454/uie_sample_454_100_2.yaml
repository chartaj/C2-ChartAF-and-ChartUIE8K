initial_prompt: <start of the annotation list> Create a spline chart to visualize
  the market share of desktop Windows versions from 2015 to 2019. Highlight the drop
  in market share of WinXP and Win7 over the years. Annotate key data points for each
  version yearly to show significant changes. The chart should help in understanding
  trends and the decline of older Windows versions. <end of the annotation list>

  left, right)?

  5. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If yes, please
  provide the desired text.

  6. Do you have any preferences for grid lines (e.g., only horizontal, both horizontal
  and vertical, no grid lines)?

  7. Would you like to use markers at each data point on the spline lines? If yes,

  9. Do you want to add a brief description or notes below the chart to provide additional
  context?'
