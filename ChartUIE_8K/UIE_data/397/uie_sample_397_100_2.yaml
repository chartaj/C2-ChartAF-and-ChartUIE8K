initial_prompt: Create a line chart representing the interaction between tech companies,
  specifically highlighting Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook.
  Include text annotations for notable data points to draw attention to key values,
  such as peaks or significant changes in trends. Modify the appearance of each company's
  line to distinguish them visually, using different colors or line styles. Ensure
  that the annotations are data-driven to focus on critical elements. This will help
  in understanding the competitive landscape and performance among these tech giants
  in the field of computers and technology.
