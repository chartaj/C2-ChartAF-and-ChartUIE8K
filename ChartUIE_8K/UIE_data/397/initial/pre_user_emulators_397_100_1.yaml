2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap that shows the interaction between major tech companies like Apple,
  Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Use data annotations to highlight
  key data points, especially where interactions have higher or lower values, to draw
  attention to these details. Employ highlights to distinguish significant elements
  visually. This visualization aims to provide an insightful overview of how these
  companies compare and interact, focusing on patterns of competition or cooperation
  in the tech industry for better understanding and analysis.
