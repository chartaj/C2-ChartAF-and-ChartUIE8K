2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart representing the interaction between tech companies, specifically
  highlighting Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook. Include text
  annotations for notable data points to draw attention to key values, such as peaks
  or significant changes in trends. Modify the appearance of each company's line to
  distinguish them visually, using different colors or line styles. Ensure that the
  annotations are data-driven to focus on critical elements. This will help in understanding
  the competitive landscape and performance among these tech giants in the field of
  computers and technology.
