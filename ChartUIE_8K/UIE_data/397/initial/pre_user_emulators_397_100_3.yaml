- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Stacked bar/column chart that utilizes the data
  format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Stacked bar/column
  chart that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I'd like a stacked column chart visualizing the interaction between various tech
  companies' investments or dealings with each other. The x-axis should list the companies
  (Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook), while the y-axis should represent
  the investment amounts. Each column should be stacked to show the respective amounts
  each company has invested in or received from the others. This will help in comparing
  the interactions among these tech giants. Please make sure to include the data for
  Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook from the provided dataset.
