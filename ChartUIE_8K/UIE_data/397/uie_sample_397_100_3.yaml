initial_prompt: I'd like a stacked column chart visualizing the interaction between
  various tech companies' investments or dealings with each other. The x-axis should
  list the companies (Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook), while
  the y-axis should represent the investment amounts. Each column should be stacked
  to show the respective amounts each company has invested in or received from the
  others. This will help in comparing the interactions among these tech giants. Please
  make sure to include the data for Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and
  Facebook from the provided dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked columns?

  2. Would you like to include data labels for each segment of the stacked columns?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which
  company?

  4. Do you want to display gridlines or any other background elements for better
  readability?

  5. Is there a specific order you''d like the companies to be displayed in on the
  x-axis?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Would you like any additional text or annotations to be included in the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the chart dimensions or aspect ratio?

  text.'
