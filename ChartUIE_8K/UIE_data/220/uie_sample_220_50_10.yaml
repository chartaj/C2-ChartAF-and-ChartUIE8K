initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the distances between different destinations
  in the Russian Cities Distance Dataset. Plot the 'Order' values on the x-axis and
  'Distance' on the y-axis, using a different colored line for each 'Destination'.
  This will visually compare travel distances.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different lines representing
  each ''Destination''?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis include titles and labels? If so, what titles would
  you prefer?

  4. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines? If yes, any specific
  style?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the axis labels and title?

  6. Should there be a legend indicating the different ''Destinations''? If so, where
  should it be placed?

  7. Do you prefer a specific line style (solid, dashed, etc.) for the different ''Destinations''?

  8. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If yes, what should it be?

  9. Should the chart have any annotations or specific markers to highlight key points?

  10. Would you like to set specific limits for the x-axis and y-axis (e.g., minimum
  and maximum values)?

  11. Do you want the lines to be smoothed or to follow the exact data points?

  12. Should the chart include any background color or pattern?

  13. Are there any specific styling or formatting preferences you have for the overall
  look of the chart?'
