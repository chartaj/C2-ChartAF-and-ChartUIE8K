initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the distances between different
  cities. Use the columns "Order" and "Destination" to represent the different city
  pairs on the x-axis, and stack the distance values for each pair. This will help
  in understanding the transportation logistics and the distance covered between various
  Russian cities. Each bar should represent a unique combination of "Order" and "Destination,"
  and the height should reflect the "Distance" traveled. This visualization will be
  helpful in optimizing routes and planning logistics more efficiently.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you like the different city pairs to be labeled on the x-axis?

  3. Would you prefer specific patterns or textures to differentiate between the segments
  within each bar?

  4. Do you want the chart to display exact distance values on each segment?

  5. Are there any particular city pairs that you want to highlight in the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred ordering for the city pairs on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability of the distances?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the chart labels and
  titles?

  9. Do you have a preference for the overall size or dimensions of the chart?

  10. Would you like a legend to be included to explain the color coding or other
  attributes of the chart?'
