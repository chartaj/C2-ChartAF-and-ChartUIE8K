initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of distances
  between various destinations in the Russian Cities Distance Dataset. The x-axis
  should represent distance bins (e.g., 0-10 km, 11-20 km, etc.), and the y-axis should
  represent the frequency of each distance range. This will help in understanding
  the most common distances traveled between cities. I want to see how distances are
  distributed across different routes, and identify which distance ranges are most
  frequent. Use different colors to represent different ranges or bins for clarity.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different distance ranges?

  2. How many bins would you like on the x-axis (distance ranges)?

  3. What should be the range of values for each bin on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis display the absolute frequency or should it be normalized/percentage?

  5. Would you like labels displayed on the bins or bars to show the exact frequency
  counts?

  6. Do you prefer any specific fonts or styles for the axis titles and labels?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the histogram?

  8. Do you need a legend to indicate what the colors represent?

  9. Would you like any specific annotations or markers to highlight certain distance
  ranges or frequencies?

  10. Do you want gridlines shown or hidden on the histogram?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Absolute frequency.

  5. Yes, please display labels with exact frequency counts.

  6. I do not know.

  7. No specific title.

  8. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  9. No specific annotations or markers needed.

  10. No preference on gridlines.'
