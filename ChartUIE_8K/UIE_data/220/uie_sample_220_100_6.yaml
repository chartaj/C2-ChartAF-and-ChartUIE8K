initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for the "Russian Cities Distance Dataset" under
  transportation and logistics. The chart should visualize the distances between different
  city pairs. Use the 'Order' column for the x-axis and the 'Distance' column for
  the y-axis, and apply different colors or markers for each unique 'Destination'.
  Include legends and axis labels for clarity. Make sure to highlight any potential
  patterns or outliers in the distances between the cities. Keep it simple but informative
  enough for someone studying intercity transportation logistics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors or markers to be
  used for each unique ''Destination''?

  2. How would you prefer the outliers to be highlighted in the scatter plot?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style or format of the legends?

  4. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like on the axes or the chart
  itself?

  5. Do you require grid lines on the chart for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I don''t know, maybe with a different color or bigger marker size.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. X-axis: "Order", Y-axis: "Distance (km)", Title: "Distances Between Russian City
  Pairs"

  5. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.'
