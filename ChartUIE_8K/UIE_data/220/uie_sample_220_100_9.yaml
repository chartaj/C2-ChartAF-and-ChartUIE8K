initial_prompt: I need a donut chart that visualizes the distances between different
  Russian cities mentioned in the dataset. Specifically, show the proportion of total
  distances for each pair of starting city (Order) and destination city (Destination).
  The chart should reflect how spread out the distances are between these locations.
  Make sure to label the segments with the cities and their corresponding distances.
  This will help in understanding the transportation and logistics between these cities.
  Use the data provided in the 220.csv file and take into account that there are no
  missing values.
questions: '1. Do you have a color scheme preference for the segments of the donut
  chart?

  2. Would you like a legend to accompany the chart, or should all labels be placed
  directly on the segments?

  3. How detailed should the labels be? Do you prefer just city names and distances,
  or any additional information?

  4. Should the chart include a title or any additional annotations for context?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences or size requirements for the chart
  labels and title?

  6. Is there a preferred order for the segments, such as by distance, alphabetical
  order, or any other specific criterion?

  7. Should the chart display percentage values alongside the distances for each segment?

  8. Would you like any additional design elements, such as borders around segments
  or shadows?

  9. Do you intend for this chart to be presented in a report, a presentation, or
  another medium?'
