initial_prompt: I need a bubble chart showing distances between Russian cities based
  on the provided dataset. Each bubble should represent a route, with the size indicating
  the distance. The x-axis will show the 'Order' and the y-axis the 'Destination.'
  There should be labels for both axes and a title "Russian Cities Distances." Also,
  include a legend explaining the bubble sizes corresponding to various distances.
  Make the chart interactive if possible, so that hovering over a bubble reveals detailed
  information about that route. Use different colors for distinct routes. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the distinct routes?

  2. Should the bubble sizes be uniform or proportionally scaled based on the distance?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and title?

  4. Would you like any specific themes or background colors for the chart?

  5. Are there any specific details you want to include in the bubble tooltip when
  hovering?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference for the distinct routes.

  2. I am not sure, but I think proportionally scaled based on the distance might
  be better.

  3. I have no specific preference for the font style or size for the axis labels
  and title.

  4. I don''t know, any theme or background color that looks good will work.

  5. I am not sure, but showing the route name and exact distance in the tooltip would
  be helpful.'
