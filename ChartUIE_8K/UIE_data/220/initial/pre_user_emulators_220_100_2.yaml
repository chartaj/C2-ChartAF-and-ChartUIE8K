2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart visualizing the distances between different orders and destinations
  in various Russian cities. Highlight the bars for Blagodarnyy's routes to draw attention
  to the short and long distances represented. Include text annotations for the distances
  on these highlighted bars to make it clear without needing to refer to the axis.
  The chart should clearly show which destinations are closest and furthest from the
  starting points. This information is important for understanding the transportation
  logistics in these regions. Make sure the bar chart is easy to read and visually
  appealing.
