initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart using the "Russian Cities Distance Dataset"
  from the "transportation-and-logistics" category. I want the pie chart to show the
  proportion of trips made to each unique destination. The dataset has columns for
  "Order," "Destination," and "Distance." Focus on visualizing the "Destination" data
  to see which cities are frequented the most. Make sure the chart includes clear
  labels and a legend for each destination. This will help in understanding how often
  each destination is chosen for travel based on the provided data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart?

  2. Would you like to display the percentage value for each slice on the pie chart?

  3. Do you want the slices to be ordered in any specific way (e.g., largest to smallest)?

  4. Would you like to emphasize certain slices (e.g., by pulling them out from the
  pie)?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the pie chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the labels and legend?

  7. Would you like to include the actual number of trips in addition to the percentages
  on the slices?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or details included on the chart to enhance
  clarity?

  9. Are there specific dimensions or size preferences for the pie chart?'
