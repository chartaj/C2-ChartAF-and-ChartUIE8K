2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a stacked column chart visualizing the how European countries generated electricity
  in 2018 by different energy types like Nuclear, Hydro, and Conventional thermal.
  Ensure each country's energy generation types are stacked to show the total production
  and percentage contributions. Highlight significant variances and larger contributing
  countries. Annotations should display precise values for major data points to focus
  on areas of interest and provide context. Include legends and color coding for each
  electricity type to enhance readability. The visualization aims to compare energy
  types across countries and assess reliance on various sources in 2018.
