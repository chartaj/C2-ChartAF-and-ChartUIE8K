initial_prompt: I am working on a project about how European countries generated electricity
  in 2018 and I need a detailed heatmap. The data covers different types of electricity
  generation like "Conventional thermal," "Nuclear," and "Hydro" for various countries.
  It also includes data from previous years (2016 and 2017) that can be useful for
  context. Please create a heatmap visualizing the electricity generation types for
  different European countries in 2018. Make it clear which countries rely more on
  specific types of electricity. Use intensity of color to represent the magnitude.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for a specific color palette or intensity
  scale for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include labels for the exact values on the heatmap cells?

  3. Is there a preferred ordering of countries or types of electricity generation
  on the axes?

  4. Should we include a legend or a separate color bar to explain the intensity of
  the colors?

  5. Do you want grid lines or borders around each heatmap cell?

  6. Is there any specific sizing requirement for the heatmap, e.g., dimensions or
  aspect ratio?

  7. Should the countries or types of electricity generation be grouped or categorized
  in any specific way?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
