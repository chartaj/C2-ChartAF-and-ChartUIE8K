initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart visualizing the how European countries
  generated electricity in 2018 by different energy types like Nuclear, Hydro, and
  Conventional thermal. Ensure each country's energy generation types are stacked
  to show the total production and percentage contributions. Highlight significant
  variances and larger contributing countries. Annotations should display precise
  values for major data points to focus on areas of interest and provide context.
  Include legends and color coding for each electricity type to enhance readability.
  The visualization aims to compare energy types across countries and assess reliance
  on various sources in 2018.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the different energy types in
  the stacked column chart?

  2. Are there specific countries you want to highlight more prominently?

  3. How would you prefer the significant variances to be highlighted? (e.g., color,
  annotations, labels)

  4. Do you have a preferred format for the annotations displaying precise values?

  5. Is there any specific layout or order you prefer for the countries in the chart?

  6. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes and legend?

  7. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and annotations in the
  chart?

  8. Should there be gridlines on the chart and if so, do you have a preference on
  their style or weight?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, countries like Germany, France, and Italy should be highlighted more prominently.

  3. I think using annotations and labels to highlight significant variances would
  be good.

  4. I prefer the annotations to be simple and clear, perhaps with the values written
  above the bars.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include a title like "Electricity Generation by Type in European
  Countries - 2018" and label the axes accordingly.

  7. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  8. I am not sure.'
