initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing electricity generation for different
  types in European countries from 2016 to 2018. Highlight key data points like the
  highest and lowest values for each year, using varied colors to distinguish them.
  Include annotations for significant trends or changes, such as a notable drop in
  nuclear power in Belgium from 2017 to 2018. This visualization should emphasize
  how energy generation types changed over time and provide insight into overall trends
  in electricity production across the continent. Title the chart "How European Countries
  Generated Electricity in 2018" to reflect the focus.
