initial_prompt: I'd like a heatmap that visualizes the production of meat across different
  countries over the years. Please use the data from the file 7.csv. The x-axis should
  represent the years, the y-axis should list the countries, and the color gradient
  should indicate the total meat production in tonnes. This will help in understanding
  how meat production trends vary internationally and temporally. Could you ensure
  the countries' codes are labeled alongside their names for easier identification?
  The heatmap should give a clear visual representation to compare production over
  time across multiple countries. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palettes or gradients you prefer for
  the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include annotations for the exact production values?

  3. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or focus on?

  4. Is there a particular format for the country codes and names display (e.g., abbreviation,
  full name, both)?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Are there any specific time intervals you''d like to emphasize (e.g., decades,
  specific years)?

  7. Would you like a legend included that explains the color gradient in detail?

  8. Should there be grid lines to help differentiate between different years and
  countries?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and titles?

  10. Do you need any additional context or information displayed alongside the heatmap
  (e.g., global production trends)?'
