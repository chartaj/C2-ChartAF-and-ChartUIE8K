initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the total meat production over time
  for various countries using the provided data. Each line should represent a different
  country, showing changes in production from 1961 to the latest available year. The
  x-axis should denote the years, and the y-axis should indicate the meat production
  in tonnes. Ensure the legend identifies each country clearly. This will help analyze
  trends, compare production levels, and identify any significant increases or decreases
  in meat production for different countries over the given period.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  countries?

  2. How would you like the axis labels to be formatted?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font type and size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should gridlines be included, and if so, would you like them to be styled in

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement and styling of the legend?

  6. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or emphasize in
  the chart?

  7. Do you prefer a particular line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for representing
  the different countries?

  8. Would you like any annotations to be included to highlight significant trends
  or events?'
