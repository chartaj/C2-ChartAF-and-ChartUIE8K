initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing total meat production (tonnes) by
  country over the years. Include text annotations for countries with the highest
  and lowest production values to highlight extremes. Use different colors to distinguish
  each country.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  countries?

  2. Would you like the text annotations for the highest and lowest production values
  to include detailed information such as exact values and years?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should we include grid lines for better readability, or would you prefer a cleaner
  look without them?

  5. Is there a specific range or limits you want to set for the axes?

  6. Do you want the extreme values (highest and lowest production countries) to be
  highlighted with a specific marker style or size?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to identify each country, or should the colors
  alone be sufficient for distinction?

  8. Are there any specific countries or years you want to emphasize or exclude from
  the data visualization?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size used in the annotations
  and labels?

  10. Should the scatter plot include a trend line, or should it only display the
  individual scatter points?'
