initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the meat production totals by country and
  year from the dataset. Focus on variations in production levels over time, highlighting
  significant increases or decreases across different countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes in mind for the
  heatmap?

  2. Do you want to use a gradient scale to represent production levels? If so, what
  range of colors do you prefer?

  3. Should we include labels for each cell showing the exact production numbers?

  4. Are there specific countries or years that you want to highlight within the heatmap?

  5. What level of detail should be included in the axis labels and titles?

  6. Do you prefer a particular size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  7. Should significant increases or decreases in production be annotated or emphasized
  in some way? If so, how?

  8. Is there a preferred ordering for the countries (e.g., alphabetical, by production
  level, etc.)?

  9. Do you want to include any additional context or notes in the chart, such as
  explanations of significant events or trends?'
