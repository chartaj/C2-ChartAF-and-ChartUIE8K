initial_prompt: I would like a choropleth map to visualize meat production across
  different countries from the dataset titled "Meat and Dairy Production." The map
  should indicate the total meat production in tonnes for each country, with different
  shades representing the production volume. Keep the year consistent; perhaps start
  with 1961 as in the sample. Highlighting changes over the years or creating an animation
  would be a bonus. Please ensure countries with no data are clearly marked as such.
  This visualization will greatly help in understanding global meat production trends.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for representing different
  meat production volumes?

  2. Would you like a particular style or theme for the choropleth map?

  3. How would you prefer to mark countries with no data?

  4. Are there any specific years other than 1961 that you want to highlight more
  prominently?

  5. What type of legend would you prefer for indicating the ranges of production
  volume?

  6. Should the map include country labels or any additional annotations?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  8. How would you like to handle the animation for highlighting changes over the
  years (e.g., a gradient transition, stepwise year change)?

  9. Should there be any specific emphasis on regions or countries of particular interest?

  10. Are there any additional data points or metrics you want to include or compare
  alongside meat production?'
