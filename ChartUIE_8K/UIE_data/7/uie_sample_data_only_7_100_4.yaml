02_initial_prompt: I'd like a heatmap that visualizes the production of meat across
  different countries over the years. Please use the data from the file 7.csv. The
  x-axis should represent the years, the y-axis should list the countries, and the
  color gradient should indicate the total meat production in tonnes. This will help
  in understanding how meat production trends vary internationally and temporally.
  Could you ensure the countries' codes are labeled alongside their names for easier
  identification? The heatmap should give a clear visual representation to compare
  production over time across multiple countries. Thank you!

  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
