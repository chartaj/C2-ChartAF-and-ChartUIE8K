  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a pie chart to visualize the total meat production by countries for
  the year 1961. Use text annotations to highlight the production values of Bahamas,
  Brunei, and Qatar to show their contributions. Additionally, employ highlights like
  colors to make these countries stand out visually from the others. The purpose of
  this visualization is to provide a clear, comparative view of meat production across
  different countries, emphasizing the specified nations. This will help in quickly
  understanding the distribution and focusing attention on these particular countries
  within the overall data context of Meat and Dairy Production.
