initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of top YouTube channel
  categories, using the categories listed and their frequency counts from the data.
  Highlight major categories like Music, Film & Animation, and Education to emphasize
  their dominance. Annotate the chart with specific subscriber numbers for these highlighted
  categories to give context to their popularity. This visualization aims to showcase
