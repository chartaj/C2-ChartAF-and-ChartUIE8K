initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the video views of the top 10 most
  subscribed YouTube channels to highlight distribution and outliers. Add textual
  annotations to emphasize notable values and key influencers like T-Series and Cocomelon.
  Use different colors to distinguish categories such as Music, Education, and Film
  & Animation. Highlight the median and quartiles clearly. The chart should be visually
  appealing and intuitive to understand, making it easy for viewers to grasp the overall
  distribution and identify leading channels in terms of video views. Include a legend
  for categories for better clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme of the categories
  in the chart?

  2. Would you like the textual annotations to specify absolute video view numbers
  or relative positions (e.g., rank)?

  3. Do you prefer the annotations to be placed inside or outside the box plots?

  4. Is there a specific format you would like for the labels in the legend (e.g.,
  full category names or abbreviations)?

  5. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the annotations and labels?

  6. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better reference, and if so,
  any specific style for them?

  7. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the chart (vertical vs. horizontal)?

  all data points other than outliers?'
