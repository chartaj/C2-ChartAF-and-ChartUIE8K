2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart visualizing the categories of the top 10 most subscribed YouTube
  channels. Highlight key information such as the count for each category, making
  distinctions between the different types of content like Music, Education, and Film
  & Animation. Add annotations to indicate the channel names and their subscriber
  counts for emphasis. The purpose of this visualization is to demonstrate the distribution
  of popular YouTube content categories and to highlight which categories have the
  highest subscriber numbers. Use the data on YouTube channels starting from 2006
  to include a historical perspective.
