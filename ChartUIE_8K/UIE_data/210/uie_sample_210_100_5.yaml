initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart that visualizes the growth of the most subscribed
  YouTube channels over time. Use the "started" data for the x-axis representing the
  year the channels began. For the y-axis, plot the "subscribers" count. Ensure to
  handle large numbers properly and maybe focus on a few key channels like "T-Series,"
  "YouTube Movies," and "Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes" for clarity. Each channel should
  have its own line to show how their subscriber base has grown from their starting
  year to the present. Highlight significant milestones if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the lines representing
  each YouTube channel?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart include data labels for each significant milestone or only at
  specific intervals?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and legend?

  5. Do you want any particular formatting for large numbers on the y-axis, such as
  using abbreviations (e.g., ''M'' for million)?

  6. Would you like to see markers (e.g., dots or symbols) at data points on the lines
  to emphasize growth points?

  7. How would you like significant milestones to be highlighted? (e.g., different
  colors, annotations, or markers)

  8. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the chart?'
