initial_prompt: I want to see a bar chart that shows the top 10 YouTube channels by
  the number of subscribers. Please use the 'rank', 'Youtuber', and 'subscribers'
  columns from the provided data. The x-axis should have the names of the YouTubers,
  and the y-axis should display the number of subscribers in millions. Each bar should
  be a different color to distinguish between the channels easily. Can you make sure
  to sort the bars in descending order of subscribers so that the top channel is on
  the left? Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include labels on the bars to show the exact number of subscribers?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer any specific colors for the bars, or should they be randomly assigned?

  6. Should there be a legend included to map colors to YouTube channels, or is it
  unnecessary given the labels?

  7. Would you like to add any annotations or notes on the chart to highlight specific
  YouTube channels or subscriber milestones?

  8. Should we include the number format of subscribers in millions with ''M'' suffix
  (e.g., 222M)?

  9. Is there a specific margin or padding you prefer around the chart for better
  visual appeal?

  10. Would you like to include any interactive elements such as tooltips (without
  asking about interactivity itself)?'
