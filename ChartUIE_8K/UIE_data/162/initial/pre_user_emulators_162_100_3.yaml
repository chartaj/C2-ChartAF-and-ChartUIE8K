- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Area chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Area chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart to visualize the Living Planet Index over time. The x-axis
  should represent the Year (1970-2016), and the y-axis should represent the Living
  Planet Index values. Display an area for the Living Planet Index and incorporate
  the Upper and Lower Confidence Intervals (95% CI) as shaded areas around the main
  line to show the uncertainty range. Ensure different shaded areas for Upper CI and
  Lower CI for better clarity. The chart title should be "Living Planet Index in Africa
  (1970-2016)" and include appropriate labels for the x and y-axes.
