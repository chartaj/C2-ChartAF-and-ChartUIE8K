- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Density plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Density plot that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a density plot to visualize the 'Living Planet Index' over different years
  from the provided data. Ensure the x-axis represents the 'Year' and the y-axis represents
  the 'Living Planet Index'. Also, include the Upper and Lower Confidence Intervals
  (CI) as shaded regions around the density plot line to show the variations. Make
  the plot informative, displaying how the index changes over time while taking into
  account the confidence intervals. This visualization should help in understanding
  biodiversity trends and uncertainties effectively. Please color the lines and shaded
  regions distinctively for better clarity and distinction.
