initial_prompt: Create an area chart to visualize the Living Planet Index over time.
  The x-axis should represent the Year (1970-2016), and the y-axis should represent
  the Living Planet Index values. Display an area for the Living Planet Index and
  incorporate the Upper and Lower Confidence Intervals (95% CI) as shaded areas around
  the main line to show the uncertainty range. Ensure different shaded areas for Upper
  CI and Lower CI for better clarity. The chart title should be "Living Planet Index
  in Africa (1970-2016)" and include appropriate labels for the x and y-axes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the area chart and the shaded
  areas for the confidence intervals?

  2. Should the shaded areas for the Upper and Lower Confidence Intervals be different
  colors or different shades of the same color?

  3. Do you want specific line styles for the main line of the Living Planet Index,
  such as solid, dashed, or dotted?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the title and axis
  labels?

  5. Do you want the y-axis to start from zero, or should it be adjusted to better
  fit the data range?

  6. Would you like to include data points with markers on the main line for the Living
  Planet Index?

  7. Do you need a legend to distinguish between the main line and the confidence
  intervals?

  8. Should gridlines be included on the chart? If so, do you have a preference for
  the style and color of the gridlines?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or reference lines you would like to include
  on the chart?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?'
