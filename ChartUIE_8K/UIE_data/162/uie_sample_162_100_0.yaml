initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the Living Planet Index over the
  years for different entities like Africa. Highlight critical years with text annotations
  showing index values, and use CI lines for upper and lower confidence intervals.
  Use shapes like arrows to emphasize significant trends or changes in the Living
  Planet Index. This visualization helps in understanding the biodiversity trends
  over time, making it easier to compare historical data and discern patterns or anomalies
  within the specified periods. Use the Living Planet Index as the main focus for
  the biological context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the scatter plot and
  CI lines?

  2. Which critical years would you like to highlight with text annotations?

  3. What specific shapes or icons would you prefer for emphasizing significant trends
  or changes?

  4. Do you have a preferred style or format for text annotations (e.g., font size,
  color)?

  5. Should the CI lines be solid, dashed, or another style?

  6. How would you like the axis labels and titles to be presented in terms of font
  size and style?

  7. Do you prefer any specific markers or symbols for the data points in the scatter
  plot?

  8. Would you like any legends or keys to be included in the chart?

  9. Are there any specific trends or changes in the Living Planet Index that you
  would like to emphasize with arrows or other shapes?

  10. Do you have a preference for the chart''s background color or gridlines?'
