initial_prompt: I want a density plot to visualize the 'Living Planet Index' over
  different years from the provided data. Ensure the x-axis represents the 'Year'
  and the y-axis represents the 'Living Planet Index'. Also, include the Upper and
  Lower Confidence Intervals (CI) as shaded regions around the density plot line to
  show the variations. Make the plot informative, displaying how the index changes
  over time while taking into account the confidence intervals. This visualization
  should help in understanding biodiversity trends and uncertainties effectively.
  Please color the lines and shaded regions distinctively for better clarity and distinction.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines and shaded
  regions?

  2. What level of granularity do you prefer for the x-axis labels?

  3. Would you like gridlines on the chart for better reference, and if so, at what
  intervals?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to indicate what each element represents?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like added to the
  chart?

  7. Would you prefer a specific style for the confidence interval shading (e.g.,
  transparency levels)?

  8. Do you want the chart to include markers at data points, or should it be a continuous
  line?

  9. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range, or should it adjust automatically
  based on the data?

  10. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart, or any subtitles and
  axis titles?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes.

  6. No specific annotations or highlights.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. It should adjust automatically based on the data.

  10. "Living Planet Index Over Years" for the title; "Year" for the x-axis and "Living
  Planet Index" for the y-axis.'
