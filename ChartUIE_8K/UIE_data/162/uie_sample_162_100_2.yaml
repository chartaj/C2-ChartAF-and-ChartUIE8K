initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the Living Planet Index from 1970 to
  1972, highlighting each year with text annotations for Living Planet Index, Upper
  CI, and Lower CI. Use different shapes like rectangles or arrows to emphasize fluctuations
  between years. This visualization should help understand the trend in the Living
  Planet Index for Africa, with a particular focus on confidence intervals. Keep the
  layout clear and easy to interpret, aiming to draw attention to changes in the index
  and its variability. Add context about the importance of the Living Planet Index
  in tracking biodiversity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the text annotations to be styled (e.g., font size, color,
  bold)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the type of shapes used to emphasize fluctuations
  between years, such as rectangles, arrows, or specific symbols?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  5. Should there be a legend or explanatory notes included in the chart?

  6. Are there any specific guidelines for the chart''s layout to ensure clarity and
  ease of interpretation?

  7. Should the context about the importance of the Living Planet Index in tracking
  biodiversity be included as a footnote, sidebar, or within the main chart area?

  8. Is there a specific way you would like the confidence intervals (Upper CI, Lower
  CI) to be highlighted or differentiated from the main Living Planet Index values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Rectangles and arrows would be good.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, a legend or explanatory notes would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Included as a footnote would be fine.

  8. The confidence intervals could be highlighted with different colors or shades.'
