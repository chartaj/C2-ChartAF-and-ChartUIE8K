initial_prompt: Create a Radar chart to visualize Africa's Living Planet Index over
  the years 1970, 1971, and 1972. Include axes for Living Planet Index, Upper CI,
  and Lower CI. Each year's data should be plotted to show the range between Upper
  and Lower CI values. Overall, demonstrate how the Living Planet Index and its confidence
  intervals have varied for Africa within these years. Make sure the radar chart is
  easy to read and visually engaging for understanding fluctuations in the Living
  Planet Index, while ensuring the biology aspect is emphasized.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the radar chart?

  2. Would you like specific markers or shapes for the data points on the radar chart?

  3. Do you prefer the axes to be labeled with full names or abbreviations?

  4. Should the chart include data value labels at each point for clarity?

  5. Do you want a legend included, and if so, where should it be positioned?

  6. Are there any particular styles for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed) or fill areas
  (e.g., transparency level) for the range between Upper CI and Lower CI values?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be visible on the radar chart for better readability?

  8. Should the radar chart include a title and/or subtitles? If yes, please specify
  the text.

  9. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart labels and
  titles?

  10. Would you like any annotations or callouts for significant variations or specific
  years?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer specific markers or shapes for the data points.

  3. Abbreviations for the axes would be fine.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please make gridlines visible on the radar chart.

  8. Yes, include a title: "Africa''s Living Planet Index (1970-1972)" and a subtitle:
  "Including Confidence Intervals".

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
