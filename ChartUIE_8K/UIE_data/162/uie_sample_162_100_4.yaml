initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the Living Planet Index data across
  different years for Africa. The columns should show the Year, Living Planet Index,
  Upper CI, and Lower CI. The heatmap should highlight ranges in these indices over
  time, with color gradients representing index values. This will help in easily identifying
  trends, spikes, or drops in the Living Planet Index. Also, ensure the heatmap is
  easy to interpret with a clear legend and labeling for context. We are focusing
  on biodiversity monitoring, so emphasize any patterns across the 47 years provided.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. What ranges should the color gradients represent?

  3. Do you want the years to be displayed on the x-axis or y-axis?

  4. Should the Living Planet Index, Upper CI, and Lower CI be shown in separate heatmaps
  or combined into one?

  5. Do you have a preference for the scale of the color gradient (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  6. Is there a specific format you prefer for the labeling of the axes?

  7. Would you like any specific annotations or markers to emphasize key patterns
  or trends?

  8. Should the legend be positioned in a particular area of the heatmap?

  9. Do you have a preferred style for the grid lines (e.g., dashed, solid) or want
  them to be hidden?

  10. How detailed should the tooltip information be if a user hovers over a specific
  cell in the heatmap?

  11. Should there be any specific threshold values highlighted, such as critical
  points in the Living Planet Index?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer the years to be displayed on the y-axis.

  4. Combine them into one heatmap if possible.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. I prefer solid grid lines.

  10. I do not need tooltip information as this is an image.

  11. I am not sure.'
