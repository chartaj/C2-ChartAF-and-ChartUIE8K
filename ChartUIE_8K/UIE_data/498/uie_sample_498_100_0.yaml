initial_prompt: Visualize a density plot for the data, showcasing columns 'x' and
  'y' to highlight data distribution and trends. Enhance specific data points with
  text annotations to draw attention to notable values. Use varying colors and sizes
  for key elements to emphasize particular areas and distinguish them from the rest.
  Ensure the plot is easy to interpret, considering no missing values and a good range
  of unique values. This will help in understanding the underlying patterns effectively.
  The visualization aims to provide valuable insights into data distribution for data
  science and analytics purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color palette or specific colors you would
  like to use for highlighting key elements?

  2. Are there any specific data points you want to be annotated with text?

  3. Would you like the density plot to have a gradient or solid color fills?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the size variations of key elements to emphasize
  particular areas?

  5. Are there any specific trends or patterns you are expecting to see and want to
  focus on in the visualization?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading to help interpret
  the plot?

  7. Do you have a preferred style for the text annotations (e.g., font size, color,
  typeface)?

  8. Is there a particular layout or aspect ratio you prefer for the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette; perhaps something visually distinct
  and clear.

  2. Yes, please highlight and annotate the data points at the coordinates (25, 50)
  and (75, 100).

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure, but noticeable differences in size would be good.

  5. No specific trends or patterns in mind to focus on.

  6. Grid lines would be helpful to interpret the plot.

  7. I do not have a specific preference for the text annotations'' style.

  8. No particular layout or aspect ratio preference.'
