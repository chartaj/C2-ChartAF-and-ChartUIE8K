initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the provided data. The dataset
  has columns 'x' and 'y', both of which are float values with no missing data. Add
  text annotations to highlight specific data points to draw attention. Include highlights
  to visually distinguish these points. The chart should help viewers focus on key
  elements before exploring others, providing context and visual clarity. The visualization
  can be used in data science and analytics to better understand trends and anomalies
  in the dataset. Make sure it is clear and impactful.
