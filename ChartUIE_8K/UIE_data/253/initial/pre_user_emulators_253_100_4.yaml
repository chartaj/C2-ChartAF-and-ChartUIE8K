- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n    \n3.\
  \ Highlights:\nDescription: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g.,\
  \ size, color) to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish\
  \ certain elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Heatmap that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Heatmap that utilizes
  all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a heatmap visualizing the volume of transactions for different cryptocurrencies
  over the period from 2018 to 2023. Each cell in the heatmap should represent the
  transaction volume on a specific date for a specific cryptocurrency. The x-axis
  should be the dates and the y-axis should be the different types of cryptocurrencies.
  The color intensity should represent the volume of transactions, with darker colors
  indicating higher volumes. This will help identify trends and patterns in transaction
  volumes over time. Please use the given data formats to generate the heatmap.
