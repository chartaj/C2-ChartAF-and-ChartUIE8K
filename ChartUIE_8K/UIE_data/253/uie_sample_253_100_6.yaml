initial_prompt: I want to create a histogram showing the distribution of closing prices
  for Tether USD from 2018 to 2023. The histogram should detail how often specific
  closing price ranges appear within this period. Ensure to include the number of
  missing values and provide separate histograms for each time period to visualize
  trends and fluctuations over time. This would help in understanding the volatility
  and stability of Tether USD prices over these years in the cryptocurrency market.
  Also, highlight any outliers or unusual spikes in closing prices.
questions: '1. What bin size or range would you prefer for the histograms?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color schemes or themes for the histograms?

  3. Should the separate histograms for each time period be displayed side-by-side
  or in a different layout?

  4. How would you like the outliers and unusual spikes to be highlighted (e.g., color,
  annotations)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences on the time period segmentation (e.g., yearly,
  quarterly, monthly)?

  6. Would you like any additional statistical information to be included (e.g., mean,
  median, mode)?

  7. Do you want any labels or annotations on the histograms (e.g., data labels, titles)?

  8. Are there any specific visual elements you want to include to display the number
  of missing values?

  9. Do you have a preference for axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?'
