initial_prompt: Please create a line chart comparing grain weight (GW) of two wheat
  genotypes (CV1 and CV2) over multiple samples.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the colors representing the two genotypes?

  2. Do you prefer to have gridlines in the background for better readability?

  3. Would you like the chart to have a legend identifying the two genotypes?

  4. Do you want data markers on the line chart to show individual data points?

  5. Should the chart display a title, and if so, do you have a preferred title?

  6. Do you want to include axis titles or labels for the X-axis and Y-axis? If yes,
  do you have specific labels in mind?
