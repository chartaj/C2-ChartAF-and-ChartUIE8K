initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing wheat grain weights for two genotypes,
  CV1 and CV2. Highlight significant differences between them with annotations. This
  will help in comparing the agricultural performance of these genotypes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include a title and, if so, what should it be?

  3. Should the axes have specific labels or units? If so, what should they be?

  4. Do you have any preference on the style or placement of the annotations highlighting
  significant differences?

  5. Would you like the chart to include gridlines or any specific background styling?

  6. Are there any specific statistical measures you would like to see included, such
  as mean or median?

  7. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the chart?

  8. Should outliers be displayed or hidden in the box chart?

  9. Would you like to see any additional markers or lines (e.g., average line) in
  the chart?'
