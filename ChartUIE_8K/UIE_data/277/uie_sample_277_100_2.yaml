initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart to visualize wheat grain weight (GW) from
  two genotypes (CV1 and CV2). Highlight the differences in weight between the two
  genotypes for easy comparison. Use text annotations to show specific weight values
  for some data points to emphasize key differences and notable values. The chart
  should draw the viewer's attention to the variation in GW between the two genotypes,
  helping to quickly identify any impactful trends or significant disparities. This
  will aid in understanding the agricultural performance of the different genotypes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the genotypes CV1 and CV2?

  2. Do you want a specific style for the text annotations (e.g., font size, color,
  or placement)?

  3. Should the y-axis be set to start from zero or adjust to the data range?

  4. Do you prefer the bars to be displayed with a particular width or spacing?

  5. Would you like to include a legend or specific labels for each genotype?

  6. Do you want to highlight any specific data points with distinct markers or colors?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Do you have a preferred title or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Are there any particular data points you want to ensure are annotated?

  10. Would you like to add any additional contextual information or notes to the
  chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Start from zero.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, include a legend for each genotype.

  6. Yes, highlight specific data points where GW differences are most notable.

  7. Yes, include gridlines.

  8. Title: "Wheat Grain Weight Comparison between Genotypes CV1 and CV2", x-axis:
  "Sample Points", y-axis: "Grain Weight (GW)"

  9. Yes, annotate the data points where the differences are the greatest and smallest.

  10. I do not know.'
