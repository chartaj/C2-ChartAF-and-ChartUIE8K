initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the grain weights (GW and
  GW.1) for two genotypes (CV1 and CV2). Add text annotations to highlight specific
  grain weight values for both genotypes. Use color highlights to distinguish between
  the two genotypes clearly. The chart aims to compare the average grain weights across
  the genotypes, drawing attention to the differences. Include axis labels and a legend
  for clarity. Given the context of agriculture and farming, this visualization helps
  in understanding grain yield differences between two genotypes, aiding in further
  research and decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for distinguishing between the
  two genotypes?

  2. What exact text annotations would you like to include for the grain weight values?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like the average grain weights to be displayed on the bars or near
  them?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels (e.g., font size, style)?

  6. Is there a particular format you would like the legend to follow?

  7. Should the chart have gridlines, and if so, in what style or color?

  8. Are there any additional data points or details that you want to emphasize or
  include in the chart?

  9. Would you like any additional titles or subtitles added to the chart for further
  context?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. The text annotations should include the specific grain weight values for GW and
  GW.1 for each genotype.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I would like the average grain weights to be displayed near the bars.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the axis labels.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I am not sure about the gridlines.

  8. No, I just want to emphasize the grain weight values.

  9. No additional titles or subtitles are needed.'
