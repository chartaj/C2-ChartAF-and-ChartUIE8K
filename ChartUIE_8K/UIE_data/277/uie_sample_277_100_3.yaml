initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the wheat grain weight for
  two different genotypes (CV1 and CV2) as shown in the given data. The x-axis should
  represent the 'Genotype' (either CV1 or CV2) and the y-axis should represent the
  'GW' (grain weight). Each point in the scatter plot should correspond to a data
  entry in the provided dataset, with different colors used for the two genotypes
  to easily differentiate them. This will help in comparing the grain weights between
  the two genotypes visually.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme used to differentiate
  the genotypes?

  2. Do you prefer any specific style or format for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like to add a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which genotype?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the title of the chart?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you prefer any specific size or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  7. Would you like to add any annotations or specific data points highlighted in
  the scatter plot?

  8. Do you have any preference for the marker style (e.g., circle, square) used for
  the data points in the scatter plot?

  9. Would you like to include axis lines or prefer a chart without them?'
