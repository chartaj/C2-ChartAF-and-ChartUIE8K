initial_prompt: Please create a line chart representing the Samsung stock prices over
  time using the dataset provided. The x-axis should show the 'Date' and the y-axis
  should represent the stock prices, displaying the 'Open', 'High', 'Low', 'Close',
  and 'Adj Close' columns. This will help us visualize the stock price movements and
  trends. Ensure each price type is distinguished with different colors or line styles
  to clearly compare their fluctuations over the given period. Label the axes and
  include a legend to make the chart readable. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing different stock prices?

  2. Would you prefer solid, dashed, or dotted line styles for distinguishing between
  different stock price types?

  3. Are there any specific date formats or intervals you would like the x-axis to
  display (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly)?

  4. Do you require any specific annotations or markers for significant events on
  the chart?

  5. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the axis labels and the legend?

  6. Should the y-axis display any specific range or scale (e.g., start from zero,
  logarithmic scale)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the chart background (e.g., white, gridlines,
  light shading)?

  8. Would you like to include a title or any additional text descriptions on the
  chart? If so, what should it be?

  9. Are there any additional elements you would like to see on the chart (e.g., moving
  averages, trend lines)?'
