initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'Close'
  prices from the Samsung Stock Price Dataset. Ideally, the x-axis should represent
  the 'Close' prices, with the y-axis displaying the frequency of these prices. Additionally,
  use a bin size that captures the overall range effectively, ensuring that the histogram
  reveals any patterns or trends in the closing prices over time. This visualization
  will help in understanding the variability and common price ranges within the dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins or the bin size?

  3. Would you like to add grid lines to the histogram for better readability?

  4. Do you want labels or annotations for specific ranges or values within the histogram?

  5. Would you like the histogram to include a title and axis labels? If yes, please
  provide the preferred text.

  6. Should the histogram display a normal distribution curve overlay?

  7. Do you have any preference for the font style and size for text elements (title,

  8. Would you like the histogram to include any reference lines, such as mean or
  median lines?'
