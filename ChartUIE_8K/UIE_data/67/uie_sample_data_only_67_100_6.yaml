02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing Samsung stock prices with columns for
  Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Could you please create a bar
  chart for me that shows the trading volume over time? Use the Date for the x-axis

  different dates. This will help me understand the trading activity and volume trends
  for Samsung stocks. Thank you!
