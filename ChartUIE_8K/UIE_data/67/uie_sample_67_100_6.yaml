initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing Samsung stock prices with columns for
  Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Could you please create a bar
  chart for me that shows the trading volume over time? Use the Date for the x-axis
  and the Volume for the y-axis. I'd like to see how the trading volume varies on
  different dates. This will help me understand the trading activity and volume trends
  for Samsung stocks. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the bar chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be solid or display patterns?

  3. Should the Date labels on the x-axis be formatted in a specific way (e.g., "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "MMM DD, YYYY")?

  4. Do you prefer gridlines to be shown or hidden on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include a title and axis labels? If so, please provide the
  title and labels.

  6. Do you want to show data values on the top of the bars?

  7. Is there a specific date range you want to focus on, or should the entire dataset
  be displayed?

  8. Do you prefer a vertical or horizontal bar chart?

  9. Should there be any specific markers or annotations on significant volume changes
  or dates?

  10. How detailed should the x-axis labels be (e.g., every day, every week, every
  month)?'
