initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Samsung stock prices with columns like Date, Open,
  High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Can you create a heatmap to visualize the
  relationship between these different stock price columns over time? Specifically,
  I am interested in seeing how the opening, closing, high, and low prices correlate
  with each other. Could you use a color gradient to show these relationships clearly?
  This would help me understand which stock prices move together and the overall market
  trend. Please make sure the heatmap is easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  heatmap?

  3. How would you like the dates to be displayed along the axis (e.g., specific intervals,
  date formatting)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradient?

  5. Is there a particular aspect ratio or size you prefer for the heatmap?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the grid lines or borders on the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap display values within each cell, or do you prefer a cleaner
  look without numbers?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette; you can choose what is most commonly
  used for stock heatmaps.

  2. I do not know if I need any specific labels or annotations.

  3. I would like the dates to be displayed in monthly intervals.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color gradient.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the aspect ratio or size.

  6. I do not have any preferences for grid lines or borders.

  7. I prefer a cleaner look without numbers in each cell.'
