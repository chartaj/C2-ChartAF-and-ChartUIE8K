initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that visualizes the data from the 473.csv file.
  The chart should display the 'date' on the X-axis and 'Value' on the Y-axis. I'd
  like the bars to represent each month from the dataset. The chart will help us understand
  the monthly value trends over the given period. Each bar should correspond to a
  data point from '2016/01' through '2016/12'. This visualization is crucial for our
  government project to track changes in values over time. Could you please make sure
  the chart is easy to read and visually appealing?
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars and the background
  of the chart?

  2. Would you like the values to be displayed on top of the bars?

  3. Should we include grid lines to enhance readability?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and title of the
  chart?

  5. Would you like to add any additional annotations or markers to highlight specific
  data points?

  6. Should the X-axis labels be rotated for better readability?

  7. Is there a specific way you want the data to be sorted on the X-axis?

  8. Do you have a preference for the width of the bars?

  9. Would you like to include a legend or any additional information on the chart?

  10. Do you want to add titles or subtitles to the chart for additional context?'
