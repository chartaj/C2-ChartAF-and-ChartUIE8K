  2. How would you like to handle the representation of peaks and troughs (e.g., specific
  colors or patterns)?

  3. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want on the heatmap (e.g., exact
  values, peak markers)?

  4. Do you want gridlines for each month and year to be visible on the heatmap?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color scale used in the heatmap?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should there be any reference lines (e.g., average value, threshold indicators)
  included on the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  9. Do you want to include a title or subtitle for additional context in the heatmap?

  10. Would you like the years to be displayed on the y-axis and months on the x-axis,
  or vice versa?'
