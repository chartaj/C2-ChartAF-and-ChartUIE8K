initial_prompt: I have a dataset detailing monthly values over multiple years with
  no missing data. I want a scatter plot to visualize the "Value" on the y-axis against
  the "date" (formatted as YYYY/MM) on the x-axis. The plot should illustrate any
  trends or patterns over time. Please ensure the dates are correctly formatted and
  evenly spaced on the x-axis for clarity. Add a title "Monthly Values Over Time,"
  label the axes appropriately, and include a legend if necessary. Ensure the points
  are clearly visible and distinct, preferably using different colors or markers for
  different years.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for distinguishing
  different years?

  2. What size and type of markers do you prefer for the scatter plot points?

  3. Should the legend specify each year or do you prefer another form of distinction?

  4. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the title and axis labels?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis have grid lines for better readability of the plot?

  6. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the date labels on the x-axis?

  7. Are there any specific data points or outliers you would like highlighted in
  the scatter plot?'
