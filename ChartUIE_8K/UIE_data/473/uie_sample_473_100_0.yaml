initial_prompt: Please create an area chart visualizing the data, displaying 'date'
  on the x-axis and 'Value' on the y-axis. Annotate specific data points to highlight
  significant values or trends. The chart should emphasize how values change over
  time, which is crucial for understanding temporal patterns in the data. Utilize
  text annotations to call out key data points that may indicate significant changes
  or milestones. Highlight these points by modifying their appearance to draw attention
  to them. This visualization will help in analyzing trends and making informed decisions
  based on the presented data.

  4. Do you have a preference for the style of text annotations (e.g., font size,
  color)?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart?

  6. Are there specific date intervals you prefer to display on the x-axis (e.g.,
  monthly, quarterly)?

  7. Do you want to include a legend on the chart? If so, where should it be placed?

  8. Should there be any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific style or format for tooltips on hover?

  10. Are there any additional elements or notes you want to include in the chart
  for context?'
