initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset with two columns: "date" and "Value." The "date"
  column consists of monthly data, and "Value" represents some numerical measurements.
  I want to create a heatmap to visualize how these values change over time. This
  data could be related to some economic indicator tracked by the government. Could
  you please develop a heatmap where the x-axis represents the months and the y-axis
  represents the years? The color intensity should indicate the "Value." Please ensure
  the heatmap is visually clear and informative. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a color legend to indicate the intensity of the values?

  3. Should we include grid lines for better readability of the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to display the exact values on the heatmap cells?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the orientation or layout of the axis labels
  (e.g., rotated labels)?

  7. Should we include annotations or markers to highlight specific time periods or
  values?

  8. Do you want to add a title to the heatmap? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  9. Do you require axis labels with detailed descriptions or just simple month/year
  indicators?

  10. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers for important thresholds
  or milestones in the data?'
