initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the data over time (t) for
  the bonds "bond 1-2" and "bond 1-14" along with the "tot energy / Eh". Annotate
  specific key points where significant changes or trends occur in the energy values
  using text annotations. Use different colors to distinguish between the bonds and
  energy lines. Highlight any trends or patterns using shape annotations like arrows
  or rectangles. The chart should aim to provide insights into the relationship between
  bond lengths and total energy over time. Ensure the visualization is easy to interpret
  and clearly labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  "bond 1-2", "bond 1-14", and "tot energy / Eh"?

  2. Is there a preferred style or format for the text annotations marking significant
  changes or trends?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape annotations (e.g., arrows or rectangles)
  to highlight trends or patterns?

  4. What level of detail do you prefer for the axis labels and titles to ensure the
  chart is clearly labeled?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the labels
  and annotations?

  6. Do you prefer to include grid lines, and if so, in what style or color?

  7. Would you like to incorporate a legend, and if so, where would you like it to
  be placed on the chart (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  8. Are there any specific points of interest or data ranges you want to be particularly
  emphasized in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the style or format for the text annotations; make sure they
  are clear and easily readable.

  3. I do not know; you can choose between arrows or rectangles based on what makes
  the trends most visible.

  4. Clear and concise labels and titles would be great.

  5. I do not have any preferences for fonts or font sizes.

  6. Including grid lines would be helpful, but I do not have a preference for style
  or color.

  7. Yes, please include a legend. I think the top right would be a good place for
  it.

  8. There are no specific points of interest; highlight the key trends and significant
  changes as you see fit.'
