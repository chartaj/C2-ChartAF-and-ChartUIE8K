initial_prompt: Create a histogram for each bond length ("bond 1-2" and "bond 1-14")
  and "tot energy / Eh" from the data provided. Ensure the histogram bins are set
  to properly capture the distribution of these values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Would you like the bin sizes to be consistent across all histograms or adjusted
  individually for each attribute?

  3. Do you have any color preferences for the histograms?

  4. Should the histograms include axis labels and titles? If so, do you have specific
  labels and titles in mind?

  5. Would you like the histograms to include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Should the histograms display any statistical information such as mean or median?

  7. Do you have a preference for the inclusion of a legend in the histograms?

  8. Would you like the histograms to show the frequency count or normalized probability
  density?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart''s overall style or theme?'
