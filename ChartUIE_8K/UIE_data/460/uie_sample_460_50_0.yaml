initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing 't' on the x-axis and 'tot energy / Eh'
  on the y-axis. Include annotations to highlight specific energy values at key time
  points. Focus on the trends in energy changes over time.
questions: '1. Do you have specific time points where you''d like annotations to be
  placed?

  2. What color scheme or palette do you prefer for the chart?

  3. Should the line have data markers for each point?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style for the line (solid, dashed, etc.)?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart? If yes, both axes or only one?

  6. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the labels and annotations?

  7. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific titles or labels beyond ''t'' and
  ''tot energy / Eh''?

  8. Do you need a legend for this chart, or is it unnecessary with only one line
  being plotted?

  9. Would you like axis limits to be set manually or automatically based on the data?

  10. Do you want to include a title for the chart? If yes, please specify the title.'
