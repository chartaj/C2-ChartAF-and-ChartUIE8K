initial_prompt: Please create a Box chart to visualize the summary statistics of bond
  lengths ('bond 1-2' and 'bond 1-14') and 'tot energy / Eh' from the dataset located
  in '../Extra_datas/data/460.csv'. Ensure that the chart highlights the distribution,
  median, and potential outliers for these columns. The x-axis should represent the
  different columns (bond lengths and total energy), and the y-axis should display
  their values. This will help us understand the spread and central tendency of the
  provided data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to add grid lines or background shading to the chart?

  3. Do you have any preference for the style of the median line within the boxes
  (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  4. Should the whiskers represent specific percentiles or extend to minima and maxima?

  5. Would you like to include notches in the box plot to indicate the confidence
  interval around the median?

  6. Do you prefer specific labels or annotations for the x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Would you like to customize the appearance of outliers (e.g., color, shape)?

  8. Would you prefer the chart to include a title or a subtitle? If yes, could you
  provide the text?

  9. Do you need any additional statistics displayed on the chart, such as mean or
  standard deviation?

  10. Are there specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for text elements
  in the chart?

  11. Would you like to include a legend in the chart? If yes, do you have preferences
  for its placement?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer the whiskers to extend to minima and maxima.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. I would like clear labels for the x-axis and y-axis, but no specific annotations.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include the title "Box Chart of Bond Lengths and Total Energy".

  9. No additional statistics are needed.

  10. I have no specific preference for fonts or font sizes.

  11. No, a legend is not necessary.'
