initial_prompt: Create a heatmap comparing bond lengths (1-2 and 1-14) over time,
  highlighting unique patterns. Use text annotations for minimum, maximum bond lengths.
  Include trend lines.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap have a specific color gradient to represent the bond lengths?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be visible on the heatmap?

  4. Is there a preferred style for the trend lines (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  5. Where would you prefer the text annotations for minimum and maximum bond lengths
  to be placed on the chart?

  6. Do you have a specific font style and size preference for the text annotations?

  7. Should the trend lines be color-coded to differentiate between bond 1-2 and bond
  1-14?

  8. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes and chart?

  9. Do you want a legend to indicate the meaning of different colors or patterns
  in the heatmap?'
