initial_prompt: I have a weather dataset covering various parameters across multiple
  locations. I want to create a line chart that visually represents temperature changes
  throughout the observation times for each location. The x-axis should display Observation
  Time, while the y-axis should show Temperature (°C). Different lines should represent
  different locations, allowing a clear comparison of temperature trends at each timestamp.
  Be sure to include labels for the x and y axes, and a legend to differentiate between
  locations. The chart should be clear and easy to interpret, considering users with
  minimal technical background.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  different locations?

  2. Would you like to include data markers on the lines to highlight individual data
  points?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend text?

  4. Should the gridlines be displayed on the chart to improve readability? If so,
  any specific preferences for the gridline style?

  5. Do you want the x-axis to display specific date and time formats for better readability?
  If yes, what format do you prefer?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure about specific color preferences, as long as different lines are
  easily distinguishable.

  2. Yes, I would like to include data markers on the lines to highlight individual
  data points.

  3. I do not know about font style or size preferences.

  4. Gridlines could be helpful for readability. I have no specific preferences for
  the gridline style.

  5. I am not sure about the specific date and time format for the x-axis; it just
  needs to be clear and easy to read.
