initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the Global Metropolis Weather
  Dataset, highlighting temperature variations across different locations, observed
  at specific times. Annotate key points to show temperature, feels like temperature,
  weather conditions, and wind speeds. This will help identify weather patterns and
  anomalies visually. Use color intensity to represent temperature differences and
  add markers for weather conditions. Ensure the map is clear and interactive for
  better user experience, focusing on distinguishing weather impacts across cities.
  This will aid in quick visual analysis of weather data and support informed decision-making.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing temperature variations
  on the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the key points (annotations) to be displayed in terms of size
  and style?

  3. Do you prefer specific symbols or icons for representing different weather conditions
  on the map?

  4. Would you like any particular labeling or legend placement on the heatmap?

  5. Are there any specific geographic regions or cities you want to prioritize or
  highlight more distinctly?

  6. Would you like to include a specific degree of opacity for the color intensity
  representing temperature differences?

  7. Do you have a preference for the base map style (e.g., satellite, terrain, street)?

  8. How would you like the wind speed to be represented—through color gradients,
  vector fields, or another method?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the exact color scheme, but please use something
  that clearly distinguishes different temperature ranges.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the size and style of the key points;
  just ensure they are readable and not too cluttered.

  3. I am not sure, but using common weather symbols (like sun, clouds, rain) would
  be fine.

  4. I do not know about specific labeling or legend placement; please place them
  where they can be easily seen.

  5. I would like to highlight major cities such as New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney
  more distinctly.

  6. I am not sure about the degree of opacity; use your best judgment.

  7. I have no specific preference for the base map style.

  8. I am not sure, but representing wind speed with vector fields sounds good to
  me.'
