initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to compare "Temperature (°C)" and "Feels
  Like (°C)" for different locations in the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''Temperature (°C)'' and ''Feels Like (°C)''?

  2. Would you like to display data labels on top of each bar to show the exact values?

  3. Do you prefer any particular order for the locations on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by temperature, custom order)?

  4. Should there be a legend indicating which color represents ''Temperature (°C)''
  and which represents ''Feels Like (°C)''?

  5. Is there a preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., should the axis range
  be fixed or dynamic based on the data)?

  6. Do you want to include grid lines to make it easier to read the values?
