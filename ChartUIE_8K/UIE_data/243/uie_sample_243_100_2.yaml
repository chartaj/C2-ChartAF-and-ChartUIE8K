initial_prompt: I would like a treemap visualization for the Global Metropolis Weather
  Dataset, specifically focusing on the 'Weather Condition' column to highlight different
  weather types across locations. Please use color variations to represent different
  weather conditions. Add text annotations to show details like 'Temperature (째C)'
  and 'Humidity (%)', and use highlights to emphasize areas with extreme weather patterns.
  The purpose is to visually compare weather conditions at a glance and identify patterns
  or anomalies across different locations on a given day. Include relevant insights
  with context, orientation, and editorial comments where necessary.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for representing different
  weather conditions?

  2. How would you like to categorize and code extreme weather patterns (e.g., specific
  colors or highlights)?

  3. What level of detail do you prefer for text annotations (e.g., font size, specific
  positioning within the treemap)?

  4. Should there be a legend or key to explain the color variations and highlights
  used in the treemap?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the treemap (e.g., vertical,
  horizontal)?

  6. Should the context, orientation, and editorial comments be displayed directly
  on the treemap, or would you prefer a separate section for these insights?

  7. Is there a specific threshold for temperatures or humidity levels that you consider
  extreme and want highlighted?

  8. Are there any specific locations or weather conditions that you want to prioritize
  in the visualization?

  9. Would you like to include any additional metadata or contextual information for
  each location (e.g., population, altitude)?

  10. How much contextual and editorial commentary do you want included with the visual
  insights?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer medium-sized fonts for readability; specific positioning isn''t crucial.

  4. Yes, a legend or key would be helpful.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Directly on the treemap would be good.

  7. Temperatures above 35째C and below -10째C, and humidity levels above 85% would
  be considered extreme for highlighting.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. A moderate amount of contextual and editorial commentary would be ideal.
