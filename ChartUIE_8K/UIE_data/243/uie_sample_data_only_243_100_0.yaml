02_initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the Global Metropolis
  Weather Dataset, highlighting temperature variations across different locations,
  observed at specific times. Annotate key points to show temperature, feels like
  temperature, weather conditions, and wind speeds. This will help identify weather
  patterns and anomalies visually. Use color intensity to represent temperature differences
  and add markers for weather conditions. Ensure the map is clear and interactive
  for better user experience, focusing on distinguishing weather impacts across cities.
  This will aid in quick visual analysis of weather data and support informed decision-making.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the exact color scheme, but please use something
  that clearly distinguishes different temperature ranges.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the size and style of the key points;
  just ensure they are readable and not too cluttered.

  3. I am not sure, but using common weather symbols (like sun, clouds, rain) would
  be fine.

  4. I do not know about specific labeling or legend placement; please place them
  where they can be easily seen.

  5. I would like to highlight major cities such as New York, London, Tokyo, and Sydney
  more distinctly.

  6. I am not sure about the degree of opacity; use your best judgment.

  7. I have no specific preference for the base map style.

  8. I am not sure, but representing wind speed with vector fields sounds good to
  me.'
