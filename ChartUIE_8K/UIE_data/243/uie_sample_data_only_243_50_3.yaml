07_questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different weather
  conditions?

  2. Would you like to include labels showing the percentage values directly on the
  pie slices?

  3. Should the legend be displayed, and if so, where would you prefer it to be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title or any specific wording you''d like
  to use?

  5. Would you like the pie chart to have outlines or borders around each slice for
  better distinction?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the chart labels and title?

  7. Should the weather conditions be ordered in any specific manner (e.g., alphabetical,
  by percentage)?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or additional information you want to be included
  in the pie chart?'
