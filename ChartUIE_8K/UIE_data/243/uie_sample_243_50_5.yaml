initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the temperature, feels like temperature,
  humidity, wind speed, cloud cover, and UV index for different locations and observation
  times from the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should we use a specific range for the color gradient (e.g., specific temperature
  range)?

  3. Would you like the locations to be displayed on the y-axis or x-axis?

  4. Is there a preferred time format for the observation times (e.g., 24-hour format
  vs. 12-hour format)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order of the data attributes (e.g., temperature
  first, humidity second)?

  6. Would you like the data values to be displayed within each cell of the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include any specific labels or titles for the axes?

  8. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and titles?

  9. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient?

  10. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would like to add to highlight
  certain data points or ranges?'
