initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the Temperature (°C), Feels Like (°C),
  and Humidity (%) over Observation Time from the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the lines representing ''Temperature
  (°C)'', ''Feels Like (°C)'', and ''Humidity (%)''?

  2. Would you like to include markers on the data points along the lines?

  3. Is there a specific line style (solid, dashed, dotted) that you prefer for any
  of the variables?

  4. Do you want to display grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Should the legend display specific labels for each line, and if so, do you have
  preferred labels?

  6. What degree of detail do you want on the x-axis (Observation Time); for example,
  every hour, day, or another interval?

  7. Do you have a preferred format for the date and time on the x-axis?

  8. Would you like the y-axes for ''Temperature (°C)'', ''Feels Like (°C)'', and
  ''Humidity (%)'' to be combined or separate?

  9. Should the chart have a title, and if so, what would you like it to be?

  10. Do you want to include any annotations or specific data points highlighted on
  the chart?'
