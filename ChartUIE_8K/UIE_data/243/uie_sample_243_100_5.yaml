initial_prompt: I need a heatmap for the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset showing
  the relationship between different weather parameters in various locations. Utilize
  data such as temperature, feels like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud
  cover. The heatmap should indicate where these parameters are more intense or correlated.
  Include labels for the observations and metrics on the axes, and use a color gradient
  to represent the intensity levels. Make sure the data is clearly distinguishable
  for easy interpretation, especially focusing on seasonal weather variations among
  different locations.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to use specific labels or abbreviations for the weather parameters
  on the axes?

  3. Should the data points be aggregated by a specific timeframe (e.g., hourly, daily,
  monthly) to highlight seasonal variations?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range for the color scale to highlight intensity levels
  (e.g., 0-100%, custom thresholds)?

  5. Are there any specific cities or locations you want to be prominently displayed
  or focused on in the heatmap?

  6. Do you prefer to display any statistical correlation values directly on the heatmap?

  7. Is there a specific layout or format you prefer (e.g., square grid, rectangular
  grid) for the heatmap cells?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference for labels or abbreviations.

  3. Yes, please aggregate the data monthly to highlight seasonal variations.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please display statistical correlation values directly on the heatmap.

  7. I have no specific preference for the layout or format.'
