initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing temperature vs. observation time
  for New York. Highlight points where weather condition is "Partly cloudy." Add text
  annotations for UV index. This will help understand daily weather patterns and UV
  exposure.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. How do you want the "Partly cloudy" points to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, shape, size)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape or style of the text annotations for UV
  index?

  4. Should the x-axis (Observation Time) be displayed in a specific format (e.g.,
  HH:MM, MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM)?

  5. Do you want any specific grid lines or axis labels to be included or modified?

  6. Would you like to add a legend to distinguish different elements on the scatter
  plot?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for text annotations and axis labels?

  8. Should the chart title include any additional information or specific wording?

  9. Do you want any specific range or limit for the x-axis (Observation Time) or
  y-axis (Temperature (°C))?

  10. Is there any additional information you would like to include in the chart (e.g.,
  a brief description, source of data)?'
