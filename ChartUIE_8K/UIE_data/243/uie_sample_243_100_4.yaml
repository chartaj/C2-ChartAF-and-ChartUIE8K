initial_prompt: Please create a box chart using the dataset from the Global Metropolis
  Weather Dataset. The chart should visualize data distribution for "Temperature (째C)",
  "Feels Like (째C)", "Humidity (%)", and "Wind Speed (kph)" across different locations.
  Each box plot should represent these values per location to observe variability
  and outliers. Ensure the labels are clear and legible, with Location on the x-axis
  and the corresponding metric on the y-axis. This visualization will help understand
  the range and consistency of weather conditions in various cities. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the box plots?

  2. Do you have a specific font style or size in mind for the labels and titles?

  3. Should we include grid lines in the background for better readability?

  4. Do you want the chart to display descriptive statistics (like mean, median) on
  the box plots?

  5. Are there any specific cities you want to highlight or focus on?

  6. Is there a specific ordering of the cities you would prefer on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If so, what
  should they be?

  8. Do you prefer any specific aspect ratio or dimensions for the chart?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers you''d like to see on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific font style or size in mind.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  4. Yes, please display descriptive statistics like mean and median.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I have no specific preference for the ordering of the cities.

  7. Yes, please include a title: "Weather Data Distribution Across Global Metropolises"
  and a subtitle: "Temperature, Feels Like, Humidity, and Wind Speed".

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions.

  9. I do not have any additional annotations or markers in mind.'
