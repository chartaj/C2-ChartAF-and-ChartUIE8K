initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize global weather conditions using
  temperature data from multiple locations. Highlight color gradients for temperature
  variations and include data on humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or gradient for visualizing temperature
  variations on the map?

  2. How would you like humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions to be represented
  on the map (e.g., icons, overlays, tooltips)?

  3. Should the map include any geographical boundaries or labels (e.g., countries,
  cities)?

  4. What level of detail are you expecting for the geographical regions (e.g., continents,
  countries, states)?

  5. Are there any specific regions or locations that you want to emphasize on the
  map?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color gradients and other data
  representations?

  7. Do you prefer a specific layout or size for the choropleth map?

  8. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to add to the map?'
