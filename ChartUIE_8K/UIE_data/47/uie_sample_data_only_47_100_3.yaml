02_initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the 2022 March Laptop data. I
  want the x-axis to show the different brands and the y-axis to represent the ratings.
  Use different lines to represent the star ratings, number of ratings, and the number
  of reviews for each brand. This chart will help visualize the user feedback on different
  laptop brands throughout the month. Ensure each line is clearly labeled and distinct
  colors are used for clear differentiation. This will help in analysis of consumer
  preferences and feedback trends in the computers-and-technology category.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
