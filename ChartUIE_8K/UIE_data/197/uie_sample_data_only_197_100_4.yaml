02_initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the "Favorite Music Genre" distribution
  among different genders from the given dataset. The X-axis should represent the
  music genres, and the Y-axis should represent the count of individuals preferring
  each genre. Use different colored bars to indicate the gender classification (e.g.,
  separate colors for 'F' and 'M'). This will help in understanding the correlation

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
