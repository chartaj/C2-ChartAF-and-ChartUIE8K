initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of favorite colors,
  favorite music genres, favorite beverages, favorite soft drinks, and gender. Highlight
  distinctive preferences such as the most favored color, music genre, and beverage
  among genders. Annotate key data points to focus attention on notable elements like
  the most and least preferred items within each category. This can help us understand
