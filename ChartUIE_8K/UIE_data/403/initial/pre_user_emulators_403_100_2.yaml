2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing the probability of rain across different
  regions using the provided data. Highlight areas with the highest and lowest probabilities
  using distinct colors to make them stand out. Include text annotations for certain
  regions to display their specific probabilities of rain and draw attention to those
  data points. This visualization will help in understanding weather patterns and
  identifying regions with varying rain probabilities. Ensure the map is clear and
  easily interpretable for viewers who want to focus on regions with significantly
  higher or lower chances of rain.
