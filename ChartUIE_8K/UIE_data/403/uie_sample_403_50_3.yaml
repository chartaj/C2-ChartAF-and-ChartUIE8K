initial_prompt: Please create a tile map to visualize the probability of rain across
  different states using the given data. Represent each state using its code, with
  tile colors indicating the probability of rain.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing different probabilities
  of rain?

  2. Should the tile colors represent probability ranges (e.g., 0-0.2, 0.21-0.4, etc.)?
  If so, do you have specific ranges in mind?

  3. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color coding of probabilities?

  4. Should the state codes be displayed within each tile, or would you prefer them
  to be shown in a separate legend?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout for the tile map (e.g., alphabetically by state
  code, geographically accurate layout)?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or labels on the map (e.g.,
  extreme values, notable weather patterns)?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like to include on the tile map?'
