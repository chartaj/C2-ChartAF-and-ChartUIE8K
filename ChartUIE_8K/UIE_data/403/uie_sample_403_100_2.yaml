initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap visualizing the probability of
  rain across different regions using the provided data. Highlight areas with the
  highest and lowest probabilities using distinct colors to make them stand out. Include
  text annotations for certain regions to display their specific probabilities of
  rain and draw attention to those data points. This visualization will help in understanding
  weather patterns and identifying regions with varying rain probabilities. Ensure
  the map is clear and easily interpretable for viewers who want to focus on regions
  with significantly higher or lower chances of rain.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight areas
  with the highest and lowest probabilities of rain?

  2. Are there specific color codes you would like to use for the highest and lowest
  probabilities?

  3. Which regions would you like to have text annotations for displaying their specific
  probabilities of rain?

  4. Do you have a preferred style for the text annotations (e.g., font size, color,
  font type)?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included in the heatmap for better clarity?

  6. Should the heatmap include boundary lines for different regions for easier identification?

  7. Do you have a specific geographic projection that you prefer for the heatmap?

  8. Is there a preferred map background (e.g., satellite, terrain, standard) that
  you would like to use for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like text annotations for major cities or regions with the highest and
  lowest probabilities of rain.

  4. I am not sure; just make it readable and noticeable.

  5. Yes, please include a legend for better clarity.

  6. Yes, boundary lines for different regions would be helpful.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
