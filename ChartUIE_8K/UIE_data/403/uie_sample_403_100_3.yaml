initial_prompt: Please create a tile map visualizing the probability of rain across
  various regions shown by codes in the dataset. Each tile should represent a different
  region and be color-coded based on the 'prob' value, with a gradient from low (light
  color) to high (dark color) probabilities. The region codes like 'ME', 'RI', and
  'VT' should be labeled on each tile. The map should highlight the geographical distribution
  of rain probability to easily interpret areas with higher and lower chances of rain.
  Make sure to include a legend and title to the map for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing low to high
  probabilities?

  2. What title would you like for the map?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font or style for the region codes labels on the tiles?

  4. Would you like any specific themes or styles applied to the map (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, etc.)?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the placement or style of the legend?

  6. Are there any specific regions you want highlighted or emphasized more than others?

  7. Would you prefer the tiles to be uniform in size or scaled based on some criteria?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color gradient.

  2. The title could be "Geographical Distribution of Rain Probability".

  3. I do not know, any readable font will do.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the themes or styles.

  5. I am not sure about the legend placement or style.

  6. I have no specific regions that need to be highlighted more than others.

  7. I would prefer the tiles to be uniform in size.'
