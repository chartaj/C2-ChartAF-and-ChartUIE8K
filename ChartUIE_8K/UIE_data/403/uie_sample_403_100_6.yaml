initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart using the data provided in the file location
  '../Extra_datas/data/403.csv'. The chart should visualize the probability of rain
  by different states. Each slice of the pie chart should represent a state, labeled
  by the 'code' column, and the size of each slice should be determined by the corresponding
  'prob' value. The chart should clearly show which states are more likely to experience
  rain based on the given probabilities. Ensure the chart is color-coded and has a
  legend for easier interpretation. The data is related to weather and emphasizes
  probabilities.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference on the specific color scheme to be used
  for the pie chart slices?

  2. Would you like the chart to include percentage values along with labels on the
  slices?

  3. Do you prefer a 2D or 3D representation for the pie chart?

  4. Should the pie chart include data labels with both the state code and probability
  values?

  5. Do you have any specific font preference for the labels and legend?

  6. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the chart
  (e.g., right, bottom, top)?

  7. Should the chart include a title? If so, what should the title be?'
