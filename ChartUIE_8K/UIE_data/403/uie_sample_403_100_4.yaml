initial_prompt: I'd like a bar chart that shows the probability of rain for each state.
  Use the 'code' field for the states and 'prob' for the probability values. The chart
  should clearly indicate how likely rain is in each state, from the least to the
  most. I'd like the y-axis labeled as "Probability of Rain" and the x-axis labeled
  as "State Code". Also, make sure the bars are color-coded for easy comparison. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be horizontal or vertical?

  3. Do you want to include data labels on each bar to show the exact probability
  values?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reading of values?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include data labels on each bar to show the exact probability values.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.'
