09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I would prefer the text annotations for the states with the highest and lowest
  probabilities to be in bold and in a contrasting color to the dots.

  3. I do not know, maybe medium-sized dots?

  4. I would like the states with the highest probability of rain to be highlighted
  in blue and the lowest in red.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the styling of non-data-driven annotations.

  6. I do not know.

  7. You could highlight which regions generally have higher chances of rain, perhaps
  mentioning the Pacific Northwest and Southeast for example.

  8. I would prefer the states to be ordered based on their probability values.'
