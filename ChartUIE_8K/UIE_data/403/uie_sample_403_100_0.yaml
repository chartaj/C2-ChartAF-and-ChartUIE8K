initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Visualize the probability of rain for different states using a choropleth map. Highlight
  states with the highest and lowest probabilities with distinct colors. Annotate
  selected states like ME, RI, and VT with their probabilities to draw attention and
  help viewers quickly identify key information. Ensure no data points are missing
  and double-check unique codes for accuracy. Aim to make the map easy to understand
  while clearly showing variability in rain probability across regions.

  <end of the instruction>'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the states with
  the highest and lowest probabilities?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding on the choropleth
  map?

  3. How would you prefer the annotation of selected states (ME, RI, VT) to appear?
  (for example, font size, color, placement)

  4. Is there a specific map projection you prefer for the choropleth map, such as
  Mercator or Albers?

  5. Would you like to include any additional information or labels on the map to
  enhance clarity and understanding?

  6. Are there any specific visual elements or styles you want to be avoided in the
  map design?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to include a legend.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I am not sure.
