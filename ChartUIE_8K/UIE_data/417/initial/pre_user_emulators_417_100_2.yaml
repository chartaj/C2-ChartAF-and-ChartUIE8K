2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between the number of babies named
  "Mia" and UFO sightings over the years. Use text annotations to highlight significant
  years and data points that show interesting trends or outliers. This will help in
  understanding any patterns or peculiar correlations between the two variables. Emphasize
  years with the highest UFO sightings or the most babies named "Mia" by using highlights.
  The purpose of this visualization is to explore the strange interplay between cultural
  phenomena and potentially paranormal events, based on the provided data.
