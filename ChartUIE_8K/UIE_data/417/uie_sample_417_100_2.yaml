initial_prompt: Create a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between the number
  of babies named "Mia" and UFO sightings over the years. Use text annotations to
  highlight significant years and data points that show interesting trends or outliers.
  This will help in understanding any patterns or peculiar correlations between the
  two variables. Emphasize years with the highest UFO sightings or the most babies
  named "Mia" by using highlights. The purpose of this visualization is to explore
  the strange interplay between cultural phenomena and potentially paranormal events,
  based on the provided data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like years with significant data points to be annotated on the
  heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer particular shapes or styles for highlighting the years with the
  highest UFO sightings or most babies named "Mia"?

  4. Should there be any specific thresholds for defining outliers or interesting
  trends that need to be highlighted?

  5. Do you have a preference for the scale or range of colors used to represent different
  correlation values?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or key to explain the correlation values and
  highlights used in the heatmap?

  7. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the text annotations?

  8. Should the text annotations only highlight the highest values, or would you like
  to see multiple significant points highlighted?'

  2. I would like significant years to be annotated clearly, perhaps with labels or
