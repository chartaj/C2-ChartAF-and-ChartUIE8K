initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the number
  of babies named "Mia" and UFO sightings from 1945 to 2010. Use text annotations
  to highlight significant data points, such as years with unusually high UFO sightings
  or spikes in the number of babies named "Mia." Apply highlights to emphasize these
  years for clearer analysis. This will help explore potential correlations or trends
  over time, making it easier for viewers to understand any possible influence of
  astrology on naming trends and UFO sighting reports. Text annotations will enhance
  the context around these highlighted points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot?

  2. Would you like specific shapes for the scatter plot markers?

  3. How would you like significant data points to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, larger size)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text annotations?

  5. Should the text annotations include any specific details besides the year and
  the value?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred placement for the legend (if needed) on the chart?

  8. How detailed should the axis labels and titles be?

  9. Should the chart include a trend line to visually depict the correlation?

  10. Do you prefer the axis scales to be linear or logarithmic?

  11. Would you like to include any introductory or concluding text on the chart?

  12. Are there any particular years or datapoints that you already know are significant
  and should be annotated?'
