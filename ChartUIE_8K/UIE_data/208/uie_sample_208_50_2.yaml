initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot chart using the provided Boston House Prices
  dataset. Highlight data points with high "MEDV" values. Annotate specific points
  showing "CRIM" versus "MEDV" relationships. Make sure to color-code by "CHAS". This
  should help in visualizing the impact of crime rate on median housing prices.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the positioning and style
  of the annotations on the chart?

  2. Do you have a particular color scheme in mind for distinguishing the "CHAS" variable?

  3. What threshold value would you like to use to define "high" for the "MEDV" values
  that need to be highlighted?

  4. Should the highlighted "MEDV" data points have a specific marker style or size?

  5. Do you prefer any specific fonts or font sizes for the labels and annotations?

  6. Would you like a legend included to explain the color-coding by "CHAS" and highlighted
  points? If yes, do you have a preference for its location on the chart?

  7. Is there a particular chart title or axis labels you would like to use?

  8. Do you have preferences for the range or scaling of the "CRIM" and "MEDV" axes?

  9. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be in a specific style
  or color?'
