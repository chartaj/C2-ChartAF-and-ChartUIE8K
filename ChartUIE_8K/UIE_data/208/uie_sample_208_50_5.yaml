initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the average 'NOX' and 'RM' levels for each 'RAD'
  value as a bar chart. This will help understand the distribution of these environmental
  and housing quality metrics across different accessibility to radial highways.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''NOX'' and ''RM'' levels?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be grouped or stacked for each ''RAD'' value?

  3. Do you have a preference for the chart title and labels for the axes?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the bars indicating the exact values?

  5. Should there be a specific order for the ''RAD'' values on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ascending, descending)?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between ''NOX'' and ''RM'' levels?

  7. Would you like to add any specific styling attributes, such as bar width or border
  color?

  8. Are there any particular thresholds or reference lines you want to include in
  the chart for context?

  9. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart text annotations?

  10. Would you like any additional information or annotations to be included in the
  chart for better context?'
