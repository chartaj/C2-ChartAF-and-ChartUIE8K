initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot for the SmartPhone Dataset from the computers-and-technology
  category. Please plot the discounted_price against the rating for different models.
  Make sure each brand_name has a distinct color. Use rom as the size of the points
  to highlight storage capacity. Include labelled axes and a legend to differentiate
  the brands. The chart should help visualize the relationship between price and customer
  rating, while also showing how storage varies across different models and brands.
  This visualization will aid in identifying value-for-money smartphones based on
  user ratings and available storage options.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for different brand names?

  2. Should the legend be placed at a specific location on the chart?

  3. Would you like the axis labels to have specific titles or formats?

  4. Do you prefer a particular size or range for the points to represent storage
  capacity (ROM)?

  5. Is there a specific style you prefer for the grid lines (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  6. Would you like to add any reference lines or trend lines to the chart? If so,
  where should they be placed?

  7. Do you have specific limits or ranges for the axes?

  8. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels, titles, or legends?'
