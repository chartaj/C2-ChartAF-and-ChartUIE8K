initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of discounted prices
  of smartphones, emphasizing the range and frequency of different price bands. Use
  text annotations to highlight the mean and median prices, purposefully focusing
  viewer attention on these statistics. Also, use highlights to distinguish between
