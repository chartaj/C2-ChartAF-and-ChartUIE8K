initial_prompt: "Create a heatmap for the Smartphone Dataset to visualize the percentage\
  \ of missing values across different features. This will help identify columns with\
  \ significant data gaps that might need attention. Highlight columns like rating,\
  \ reviews, and ram where you notice missing values. Additionally, distinguish common\
  \ attributes like brand_name, model_name, and battery to get an overall sense related\
  \ to completeness. This chart will help in assessing the data quality and determine\
  \ areas that require data cleaning or imputation. \n\n"
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to set a specific range for the color gradient in the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer showing the exact percentage values within each cell of the heatmap?

  4. How would you like missing values to be highlighted or annotated in the heatmap?

  5. Are there specific labels or titles you would like on the axes and heatmap itself?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to interpret the color scale used in the heatmap?

  7. Should the order of columns be based on the percentage of missing values or remain
  as per the dataset order?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  9. Would you like any additional annotations or markers to highlight specific columns
  such as ''rating'', ''reviews'', and ''ram''?'
