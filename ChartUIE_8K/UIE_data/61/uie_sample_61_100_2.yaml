initial_prompt: Please create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of unique
  smartphone brands in the dataset. Ensure the chart highlights the brands with the
  highest and lowest number of models. Include text annotations for the top three
  most common brands, displaying the number of models each has. The purpose is to
  quickly identify market leaders and less represented brands. Utilize highlights
  to distinguish the top brands by changing their slice colors to make them stand
  out. This visualization will provide insights into brand diversity within the smartphone
  market segment.

  in the donut chart?

  by number of models)?

  top three?'
