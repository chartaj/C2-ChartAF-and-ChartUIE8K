initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart comparing the different models of
  smartphones based on their discount rates. Use the discounted price and original
  price to calculate the discount for each model. Group the bars by brand names and
  stack them by model names. Ensure the chart clearly shows the discount percentage
  for each model within a brand so that we can easily compare different smartphone
  models. Also, make sure to include legends and labels for clarity. Thank you!
