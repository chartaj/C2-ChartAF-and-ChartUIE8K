initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of different 'Investment
  Types' in Indian startup funding. Use the provided data to show how each type, such
  as 'Private Equity Round', 'Series B', 'Series C', etc., contributes to the overall
  funding landscape. Label each segment clearly with the investment type and ensure
  the proportion of each type is visible. Include a legend for easy reference and
  use contrasting colors for each segment to distinguish them better. This can help
  in understanding which types of investments are most common in the startup ecosystem.
