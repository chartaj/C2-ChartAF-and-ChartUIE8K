2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a box chart using the 'price' data to visualize its distribution for
  the business dataset related to price and the number of purchasers. The chart should
  include data-driven text annotations highlighting the quartiles, median, and any
  outliers. Highlights should modify the appearance of outliers to make them stand
  out visually. The purpose is to identify the central tendency, spread, and any anomalies
  in the pricing data to better analyze purchasing trends. Ensure the annotations
  and highlights draw attention to key areas and provide a clear interpretation of
  the data distribution.
