initial_prompt: Create a density plot for the prices of business purchases. The x-axis
  should represent the price values and the y-axis should represent the density. Annotate
  the plot with data-driven text annotations, highlighting key price points to draw
  attention to specific values. Additionally, use highlights to emphasize certain
  price ranges, such as low, medium, and high prices. This chart should help in understanding
  the distribution of prices and identify common price points or anomalies. Please
  make sure to label the axes and include a legend to interpret the highlighted sections.
