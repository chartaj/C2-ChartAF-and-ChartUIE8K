initial_prompt: Please visualize the "price" data using a histogram to show the distribution
  of purchase prices in the business dataset. Use data-driven text annotations to
  highlight specific data points that represent the highest and lowest prices. Additionally,
  use highlights to emphasize the most frequent price range. This will help in quickly
  identifying price trends and outliers within the dataset. Given the business context,
  this visualization will be useful for understanding the pricing structure and potential
  pricing strategy adjustment.

  2. What bin size do you recommend for the histogram?

  3. How would you like the most frequent price range to be highlighted (e.g., color,
  border)?

  4. Do you have any preference on the placement and format of the text annotations

  specific wording in mind?

  6. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart text?

  7. Do you want any gridlines in the histogram? If yes, any preferences on their
  appearance?

  8. Should the chart include a legend, especially if multiple colors or highlights
  are used?'
