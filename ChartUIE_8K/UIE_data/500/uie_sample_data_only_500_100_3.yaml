  I have a dataset on squirrel sightings in NYC with geographic coordinates (latitude
  and longitude) and various squirrel behaviors. I envision a geographic heatmap of
  NYC showing the density of squirrel sightings. Different colors could represent
  the concentration of sightings, possibly segregated by primary fur color. We should
  also plot interactive points, where clicking a point reveals additional data such
  as specific squirrel behaviors observed at that location. This heatmap will help
  visualize where squirrels are most commonly found and highlight behavioral patterns.
  Can you create this map?
