initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the behaviors (running, chasing,
  climbing, etc.) of squirrels by their primary fur color. Highlight the squirrel
  IDs and dates for specific observations to emphasize trends. This helps understand
  the activity patterns and interactions among different fur colors in NYC parks.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for displaying different fur
  colors in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to show data labels with specific observation counts
  on each segment of the bars?

  3. How would you like to handle dates in the chart? For example, should they be
  aggregated by month, week, or displayed as individual dates?

  4. Do you prefer any specific order for the behaviors (running, chasing, climbing,
  etc.) within each bar segment?

  5. Would you like the primary fur colors to be sorted in any specific order, such
  as by frequency or alphabetically?

  6. How would you like to highlight the squirrel IDs and dates for specific observations?
  Would a tooltip, annotation, or color highlight be preferable?

  7. Is there any specific size or dimension preference for the chart to ensure readability
  and clarity?'
