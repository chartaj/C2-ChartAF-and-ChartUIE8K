initial_prompt: Create a heatmap showing the distribution of squirrel sightings in
  NYC across different locations (hectare) and times (shift). Highlight areas with
  high squirrel activity and use text annotations to spotlight key data points, such
  as unique squirrel IDs and primary fur colors. Emphasize interactions like running,
  climbing, and foraging behaviors. This visualization will help in understanding
  squirrel activity patterns and behaviors within various NYC boroughs.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for the heatmap to represent
  different levels of squirrel activity?

  2. Would you like to use specific shapes or icons for the text annotations representing
  unique squirrel IDs and primary fur colors?

  3. How would you like to differentiate between the interactions (running, climbing,
  foraging) on the heatmap?

  4. Do you prefer any particular fonts or styles for the text annotations?

  5. Are there any specific boroughs or areas within NYC that you want to highlight
  or focus on more prominently?

  6. Would you like the heatmap to include any specific legend or key to explain the
  color coding and interactions?

  7. Do you have a preference for how the time shifts (AM/PM) should be represented
  visually in the heatmap?

  8. How detailed should the geographic locations be? Do you want to include fine
  details like community districts or police precincts?

  9. Would you prefer to see additional statistical information, such as the count
  of sightings per hectare or shift, alongside the visual representation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have any specific preference.

  3. I would like to use different colors or icons to differentiate between running,
  climbing, and foraging.

  4. I have no specific preference for fonts or styles.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, I would like the heatmap to include a legend or key to explain the color
  coding and interactions.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Yes, I would prefer to see additional statistical information, such as the count
  of sightings per hectare or shift, alongside the visual representation.'
