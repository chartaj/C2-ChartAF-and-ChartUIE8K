initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between
  'Unit price' and 'Quantity' from the sales dataset. Each point should represent
  an invoice transaction. Color the points based on the 'Product line' to distinguish
  different product categories. Additionally, use different shapes to denote the 'Branch'
  to see how sales vary across different branches. The x-axis should be 'Unit price'
  and the y-axis 'Quantity'. Make sure to include a legend and appropriate axis labels
  for clarity. The plot will help analyze sales patterns for different products and
  branches.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for different
  ''Product line'' categories?

  2. Do you have any preferred shapes for the different ''Branch'' indicators?

  3. What font style and size do you prefer for the legend and axis labels?

  4. Are there any specific ranges or scales you would like for the x-axis (''Unit
  price'') and y-axis (''Quantity'')?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the plot? If yes, do you have a
  preference for their style or color?

  6. Do you need any annotations or reference lines added to the plot for better interpretation?

  7. Is there a specific layout or size requirement for the plot?

  8. Would you like a title on the scatter plot? If so, what should it be?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not have any specific preference.

  4. I am not sure about specific ranges or scales.

  5. Yes, grid lines would be helpful. I do not have a preference for their style
