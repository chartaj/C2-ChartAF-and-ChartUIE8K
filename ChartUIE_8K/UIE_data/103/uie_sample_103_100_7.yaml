initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to business sales with columns like 'Total',
  'Quantity', and 'Unit price'. I would like to visualize this data using a histogram
  to understand the distribution. Specifically, I am interested in seeing histograms
  for the 'Total' and 'Quantity' columns. The 'Total' column will show the distribution
  of the total sale amounts, and the 'Quantity' column will illustrate the distribution
  of quantities sold. This will help in identifying trends and patterns in the sales
  data. Please provide a histogram for each of these columns. Thank you.
questions: '1. What title would you like for each histogram?

  2. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  3. What color scheme would you prefer for the histograms?

  4. Should the axes labels be customized in any specific way?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the histograms?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text on the charts?

  7. Should the histograms include any annotations or additional information?

  8. Do you need a legend for the histograms?

  9. Would you like to overlay any statistical information, such as a normal distribution
  curve, on the histograms?

  10. Is there a specific layout or formatting style you prefer for presenting these
  histograms?'
