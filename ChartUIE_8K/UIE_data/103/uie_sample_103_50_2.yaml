initial_prompt: Create a line chart illustrating sales trends over time, focusing
  on "Total" sales amounts by "Date." Highlight significant peaks and add text annotations
  for highest and lowest points, specifying "City" and "Branch." Reflect how different
  payment methods affect sales using varying line styles.

  2. Which date format do you prefer on the x-axis (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY)?

  3. How would you like the significant peaks and troughs to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different color, marker)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) for
  different payment methods?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between different payment methods?

  6. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you want to include gridlines on the chart, and if so, in what style (e.g.,
  dashed, solid)?

  8. Would you like data points to be shown on the lines (e.g., markers at each data
  point)?

  9. Is there a particular font style and size you prefer for the text annotations?

  10. How would you like to handle overlapping annotations, if any (e.g., text rotation,
  use of connectors)?'
