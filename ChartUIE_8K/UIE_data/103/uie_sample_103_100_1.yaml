initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize the sales dataset. The
  chart should display sales by different product lines, grouped by branches. Highlight
  the total sales and gross income for each branch, using different colors for each
  product line. Include text annotations to show the total sales figures on top of
  each stacked column and call out the highest and lowest sales branches with comments.
  This will help us quickly understand which branches and product lines are performing
  best within our business.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for different
  product lines?

  2. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations on the chart?

  3. How would you like the highest and lowest sales branches to be highlighted or
  annotated?

  4. Do you prefer any specific layout or orientation for the chart (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal columns)?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you wish to include on the chart?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be displayed in
  a particular style?
