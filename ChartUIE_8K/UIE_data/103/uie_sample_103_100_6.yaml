initial_prompt: I want a bar chart comparing average unit prices of different product
  lines across the three branches (A, B, and C). Use data from 'Unit price' and 'Product
  line' columns, with separate bars for each branch within each product line. Label
  the x-axis with product lines and the y-axis with average unit prices. Ensure each
  product line category groups the bars by branch. This will help analyze pricing
  trends and differences in product categories sold in different branches to make
  strategic decisions. Highlighting the branches within each product line is crucial
  for this comparison.

  each branch?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you would like the product lines to appear
  on the x-axis?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to clearly identify the branches?

  8. Do you want data values to be displayed on top of the bars?
