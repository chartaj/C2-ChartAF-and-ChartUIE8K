02_initial_prompt: I would like to see a line chart that shows the trend over loan
  terms (loan_term) with different loan amounts (loan_amount), income yearly (income_annum),
  and loan status (loan_status) over time. I want to understand how the loan amount
  and income influence the approval or rejection status throughout different loan
  terms. Please plot the loan terms on the x-axis, and have multiple lines representing
  loan amounts, income, and statuses on the y-axis. This will help in visualizing
  trends in loan approvals based on financial metrics over time. Thank you!
