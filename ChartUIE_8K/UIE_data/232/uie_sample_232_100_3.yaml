initial_prompt: Please create a stacked column chart to visualize the Loan-Approval-Prediction-Dataset.
  The chart should show the distribution of loan statuses (Approved, Rejected) across
  different education levels (Graduate, Not Graduate). Use the X-axis to represent
  the education levels and the Y-axis to represent the number of each loan status.
  Each column should be stacked with sections representing the counts of Approved
  and Rejected loans for each education level. This will help us understand the correlation
  between education level and loan approval rates. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on each section of the stacked columns?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the loan statuses?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the axis labels and
  titles?

  itself?

  7. Should the chart include any titles or subtitles to provide additional context?

  on the X-axis?
