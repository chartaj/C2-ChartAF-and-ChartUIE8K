initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between income_annum
  and loan_amount. Use data points to represent loan_id. Highlight points based on
  loan_status with differing colors for 'Approved' and 'Rejected'. Add text annotations
  for data points where cibil_score is greater than 750 to draw attention to high
  creditworthiness. This will help in understanding the influence of annual income
  on loan amounts approved or rejected, considering the applicant's credit score.
  The primary purpose is to identify trends and patterns that could inform better
  business decisions in loan approval processes in a business context.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to highlight
  ''Approved'' and ''Rejected'' loans?

  2. How would you like the text annotations for high cibil score data points to appear
  (e.g., font size, color)?

  3. Do you prefer the data points to have a specific shape or size?

  4. Would you like a legend to be included in the scatter plot?

  5. Is there a specific title or subtitle you want for the scatter plot?

  6. Do you want to include axis labels? If so, do you have a preference for their
  text or style?

  7. Should there be gridlines on the scatter plot? If yes, do you have a preference
  for their styling?

  8. Is there a specific range you want for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the scatter plot
  (e.g., minimalist, detailed, corporate)?'
