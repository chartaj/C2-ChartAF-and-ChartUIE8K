initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart visualizing the appearance of X-men characters
  in Chris Claremont comics. The pie chart should show the distribution of different
  characters (from the 'character' column) across the issues (from the 'issue' column).
  Please ensure that each character's share of total appearances is clearly indicated.
  Each slice of the pie should represent a character, and the size should correspond
  to the number of issues in which they appear. Include labels or a legend for clarity.
  Use distinct colors for each character slice to differentiate them easily.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each character slice?

  2. Would you like the character names to be displayed directly on the slices or
  as part of a legend?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the labels or legends?

  4. Should the pie chart include percentage values alongside the character names?

  5. Do you prefer the pie slices to be presented in a specific order (e.g., descending
  order of appearances)?

  6. Would you like to add a title or subtitle to the pie chart for additional context?

  7. Are there any specific characters you would like to highlight or emphasize in
  the pie chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. As part of a legend.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, please include percentage values.
