initial_prompt: I have mutation data summarizing positions, reference and query codons,
  and mutation types. I need a box chart visualizing the spread of positions for each
  unique mutation type. This will help me understand how mutation positions vary across
  different mutation categories, like Missense Substitution and Silent Substitution.
  Also, ensure to highlight any data anomalies or unusual variances if present. Kindly
  make the chart user-friendly, with clear legends and labels. This visualization
  will assist in my biological research on DNA mutations. Let me know if any further
  details are needed. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for easier reference?

  3. Are there specific mutation types that you would like to highlight or distinguish
  more prominently?

  4. Do you prefer a horizontal or vertical layout for the box chart?

  5. Should the chart include data labels indicating specific position values or statistical
  summaries?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds for variances or anomalies that you would like
  to define?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and legends?

  8. Would you like to include annotations or comments on specific data points within
  the chart?

  9. Should the chart include a title or supplementary text for better understanding?
  If so, what should it say?

  10. Is there a specific format or style for outlier points you prefer in the box
  chart?'
