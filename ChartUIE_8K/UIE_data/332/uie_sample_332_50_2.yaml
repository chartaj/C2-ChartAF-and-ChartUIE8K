initial_prompt: Create a network diagram visualizing DNA mutations. Annotate critical
  nodes exhibiting significant mutations such as 'Missense Substitution.' Highlight
  nodes with unique mutation types, making them stand out. Use the data details for
  context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting critical nodes
  with significant mutations?

  2. How would you like the unique mutation types to be represented (e.g., specific
  colors, shapes, or sizes)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the layout algorithm of the network diagram (e.g.,
  force-directed, circular, hierarchical)?

  4. Would you like labels to be displayed for all nodes, or only for those with significant
  mutations?

  5. Should there be a legend explaining the node color and shape representations?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for annotations and labels?

  7. Are there any specific details or data elements you want to include in the annotations
  for the critical nodes?

  8. Do you need any additional context or reference information to be included in
  the diagram, such as a brief description of mutation types?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Only for those with significant mutations.

  5. Yes, a legend explaining the node color and shape representations.

  6. I do not have a preference.

  7. Yes, include the type of mutation and its potential impact.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
