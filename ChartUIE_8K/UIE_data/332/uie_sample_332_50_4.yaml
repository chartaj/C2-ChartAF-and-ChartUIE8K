initial_prompt: Please create a line chart showing the number of each Mutation_Type
  across different Reference_Codon positions, using data provided in the `332.csv`
  file about DNA mutations.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different Mutation_Types?\n\
  2. Should the x-axis be labeled with specific Reference_Codon positions or do you\
  \ have another preference?\n3. Do you want gridlines to be displayed in the background\
  \ of the chart for better readability? \n4. Would you like to include data labels\
  \ showing the number of mutations at each point on the line chart?\n5. Should the\
  \ legend be placed in a specific location on the graph?\n6. Do you have a preferred\
  \ style for the lines (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted) representing each Mutation_Type?\n\
  7. Would you prefer a specific font or size for the axis labels and title?\n8. Is\
  \ there a specific title or sub-title you would like to include on the chart?\n\
  9. Do you want to display any additional context or notes within the chart?"
