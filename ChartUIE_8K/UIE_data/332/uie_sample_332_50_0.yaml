initial_prompt: Create a bar chart illustrating the frequency of different Mutation_Types
  in the DNA mutations data. Highlight the most common mutation type to stand out
  visually. Include annotations that describe each mutation type for clarity and insight.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. How would you like the most common mutation type to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, bold outline)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the order of categories on the x-axis (e.g., sorted
  by frequency, alphabetical)?

  4. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any particular annotation styles you prefer for describing each mutation
  type (e.g., text size, font, placement)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend for the mutation types, or do you prefer annotations
  only?

  7. Do you have any specific size or aspect ratio requirements for the bar chart?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart for easier interpretation
  of values?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different color would be good.

  3. Sorted by frequency, please.

  4. X-axis: "Mutation Types", Y-axis: "Frequency"

  5. I am not sure.
