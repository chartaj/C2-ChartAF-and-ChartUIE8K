initial_prompt: Create a network diagram showing DNA mutations in different positions.
  Node size represents mutation frequency, and edges link positions with the same
  mutation type. Use text annotations to highlight key positions and their mutation
  types (e.g., missense or silent). Emphasize nodes with high mutation counts using
  colors or size. This visual will help understand mutation patterns and relationships,
  aiding in genetic research or medical studies. Include 3 sample positions (5, 44,
  81) with respective codons and mutation types to give context. This way, the viewerâ€™s
  attention is drawn to critical mutations and their distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting nodes with high
  mutation counts?

  2. Would you like to specify the font type and size for text annotations?

  3. Should the edges have different styles or weights depending on the mutation type?

  4. Is there a specific shape you prefer for the nodes other than circles?

  5. Do you want any additional legends or explanatory text included in the chart?

  6. Are there specific key positions, apart from the provided examples (5, 44, 81),
  that you would like to highlight?

  7. How detailed should the text annotations be for the highlighted key positions?

  8. Would you prefer a specific layout for the network diagram (e.g., circular, hierarchical)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, different styles or weights for edges depending on the mutation type would
  be great.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend or explanatory text.

  6. No, the provided examples (5, 44, 81) are fine.

  7. Detailed text annotations to provide context for the highlighted key positions
  would be helpful.

  8. I am not sure.'
