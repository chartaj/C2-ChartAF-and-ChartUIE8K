initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the mutation data. The chart should
  show the proportion of each Mutation_Type (e.g., Missense Substitution, Silent Substitution)
  in the dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the specific Mutation_Types and
  their percentages. The visualization aims to provide an overview of the types of
  DNA mutations present and their frequency, helping understand the mutation landscape.
  Highlight the most common mutation types. This will be useful for quickly grasping
  which mutations are predominant without delving into each individual data point.
  Keep it clear and focused on the mutation distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the different Mutation_Types?

  2. Would you like any particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  3. Should the most common Mutation_Types be highlighted in a unique way, such as
  bolded text or a different color?

  4. Is there a preference for where the legend should be positioned on the chart?

  5. Do you want the pie chart segments to be labeled with the percentage, the Mutation_Type,
  or both?

  6. Should the chart have a title or subtitle, and if so, what should it be?

  7. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the pie chart?

  8. Would you like to include any source or reference information on the chart?

  9. Should the chart have any borders or outlines around the segments?

  10. Are there any specific styles or themes you prefer for the overall design of
  the pie chart?'
