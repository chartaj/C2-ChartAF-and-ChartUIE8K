2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart to visualize the mutation data. The chart should show the proportion
  of each Mutation_Type (e.g., Missense Substitution, Silent Substitution) in the
  dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the specific Mutation_Types and their
  percentages. The visualization aims to provide an overview of the types of DNA mutations
  present and their frequency, helping understand the mutation landscape. Highlight
  the most common mutation types. This will be useful for quickly grasping which mutations
  are predominant without delving into each individual data point. Keep it clear and
  focused on the mutation distribution.
