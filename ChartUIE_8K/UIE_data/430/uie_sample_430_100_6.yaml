initial_prompt: I want to see a grouped bar chart that visualizes the number of weeks
  each top Christmas song from 1958 spent on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Group the
  bars by the song titles, with one bar each representing 'weeks on chart' and 'peak
  position'. This will help me understand how well each Christmas song performed.
  Make sure the chart is easy to read, with a clear legend and labels for both axes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the bars or the
  background of the chart?

  2. What specific format do you prefer for the legend? For example, ''weeks on chart''
  and ''peak position''.

  3. Would you like to add any specific labels or annotations to highlight particular
  songs or data points?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font type and size for the axis labels and title?

  5. How would you prefer the bars to be grouped? For example, side-by-side or stacked?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart''s dimensions or aspect ratio?

  7. Are there any particular songs or data points you would like to be emphasized
  or highlighted in the chart?'
