initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of 'weeks_on_chart'
  for songs in the Billboard Hot 100, explicitly highlighting Christmas songs. Use
  text annotations to highlight key points, such as the most extended charting weeks
  for a song. The chart should help identify how many weeks popular tracks, especially
  Christmas hits, stayed on the chart. This visualization will provide insights into
  the staying power of seasonal music versus regular releases, drawing attention to
  enduring holiday classics. Ensure the x-axis represents weeks and the y-axis shows
  the number of songs.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting Christmas songs
  versus regular songs?

  2. Would you like specific bins for the histogram or should we use an automatic
  binning method?

  3. Should the text annotations highlighting key points use a specific font size
  or style?

  4. Do you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the histogram?

  5. Would you like a legend included to distinguish between Christmas songs and regular
  songs?

  6. Is there a particular way you would like the x-axis and y-axis labeled or formatted?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement or styling of the title for the chart?

  8. Are there any specific Christmas songs you want to highlight within the text
  annotations?'
