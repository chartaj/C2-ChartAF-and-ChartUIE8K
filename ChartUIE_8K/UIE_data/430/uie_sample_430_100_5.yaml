initial_prompt: Please create a column chart using the provided data about Christmas
  songs charting on the Billboard Hot 100. The x-axis should represent the songs (distinct
  song titles) and the y-axis should represent the peak position each song reached
  on the chart. The chart should visualize how high each song ranked and indicate
  the performer of each song. Make sure the chart is clearly labeled and includes
  a legend for ease of understanding.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Would you like to see specific color coding for different performers?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the song titles on the x-axis be displayed horizontally or rotated at
  an angle for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer the columns to have specific widths or be auto-sized?

  6. Would you like the chart to include gridlines on the y-axis?

  7. Should the chart title include a specific phrasing or emphasis?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the legend placement (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, or right)?

  9. Would you like to display data values on top of each column bar in the chart?

  10. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include
  on the chart?'
