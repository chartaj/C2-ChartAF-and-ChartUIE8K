initial_prompt: Please create a spline chart that visualizes the performance of Christmas
  songs on the Billboard charts over time. The x-axis should represent the dates (weekid),
  and the y-axis should indicate the week_position of the songs. Use different colors
  to represent different songs so that we can easily compare their chart performance.
  Include a legend for clarity. Focus on highlighting how long each song stays on
  the chart (weeks_on_chart) and their peak positions. The chart should cover the
  full time span provided in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific annotations or markers for peak positions on the
  chart?

  3. How would you prefer the weeks on chart to be highlighted or indicated?

  4. Do you have a preferred date format for the x-axis labels (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY)?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you want to use for the chart labels
  and legend?

  6. Would you like the y-axis (week_position) to be inverted to show the top positions
  at the top of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific titles or labels you want for the chart axes and overall
  chart?

  8. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, do you have a preference for
  their style or color?'
