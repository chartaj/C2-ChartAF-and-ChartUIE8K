initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Christmas songs that have charted on the Billboard
  Hot 100. I'd like to create a visualization that shows the range of peak positions
  over time for the top-performing Christmas songs. The chart should include the song
  title, performer, and the peak position over the weeks on the chart. Make sure to
  highlight the changes in peak positions and the total weeks each song remained on
  the chart. Additionally, differentiate each song using colors and include a timeline
  on the x-axis that tracks the songs through the weeks of the year.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the type of chart (e.g., line
  chart, bar chart, scatter plot)?

  2. Do you prefer a particular color scheme for differentiating each song?

  3. Would you like the chart to include annotations for significant events or milestones
  in the data?

  4. How would you like the timeline on the x-axis to be formatted (e.g., weekly,
  monthly)?

  5. Do you have a preference for displaying the song title and performer (e.g., in
  a tooltip, legend, or on the chart itself)?

  6. Should the chart display only the top-performing songs or include all songs in
  the dataset?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labeling or formatting for the peak position values?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to help identify each song by its color?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Weekly format on the x-axis would be good.

  5. Display the song title and performer on the chart itself.

  6. Display only the top-performing songs.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, include a legend to help identify each song by its color.'
