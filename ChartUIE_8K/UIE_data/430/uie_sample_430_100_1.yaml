initial_prompt: I want a line chart that shows the weekly positions of Christmas songs
  on the Billboard chart over time. Use the data to plot the week positions for each
  song, making it easy to see trends. Highlight important songs like "RUN RUDOLPH
  RUN" and "JINGLE BELL ROCK" by using distinct colors or larger points. Annotate
  the peak positions to emphasize the highest rank each song achieved. The chart should
  visually narrate the journey of these songs during the holiday season, making it
  clear and engaging for the viewer at a glance.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the distinct colors
  used to highlight the important songs?

  2. Do you prefer a specific type of annotation for the peak positions (e.g., text
  labels, arrows, stars)?

  3. Are there any additional songs apart from "RUN RUDOLPH RUN" and "JINGLE BELL
  ROCK" that you would like to highlight?

  4. Do you have a preferred background color or theme for the chart (e.g., dark,
  light, festive colors)?

  5. Should the y-axis be inverted so that the highest positions are at the top, reflecting
  the best chart positions more intuitively?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to help identify the highlighted songs and
  their colors?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the labels and
  annotations on the chart?

  8. Should we include any gridlines for better readability of the chart, and if so,
  any specific style preferences?

  9. Do you prefer the chart to display data from a specific time period or cover
  all available data?

  10. Would you like the line chart to have markers at each data point, or should
  the lines themselves be sufficient?'
