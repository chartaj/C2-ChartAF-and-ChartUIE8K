initial_prompt: Create a box chart showing the distribution of peak positions for
  Christmas songs on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Use data from 1958, highlighting
  the week positions and peak positions. Differentiate the songs by performer and
  mark the instances where a song re-entered the chart. Include labels for quartiles,
  median, and any outliers. Highlight key performers like Chuck Berry and Bobby Helms.
  The X-axis should represent different songs while the Y-axis should show peak positions.
  The chart should help visualize how often and how high Christmas songs rank, providing
  insights into their popularity over time.
