  Create a bubble chart to visualize the imports and exports of dogs by state. Use
  the size of the bubbles to represent the ''total'' column, while the x and y axes
  represent ''exported'' and ''imported'' respectively. Highlight the bubbles for
  states with no missing values in ''imported'' to emphasize complete data. Include
  text annotations for the top 3 states with the highest ''total'' values to draw
  attention to significant data points. Ensure the chart distinguishes between states
  within the US and those outside using color variations.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
