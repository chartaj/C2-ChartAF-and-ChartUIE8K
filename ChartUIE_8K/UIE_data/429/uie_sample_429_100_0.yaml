initial_prompt: '<start of the instruction>

  Create a bubble chart to visualize the imports and exports of dogs by state. Use
  the size of the bubbles to represent the ''total'' column, while the x and y axes
  represent ''exported'' and ''imported'' respectively. Highlight the bubbles for
  states with no missing values in ''imported'' to emphasize complete data. Include
  text annotations for the top 3 states with the highest ''total'' values to draw
  attention to significant data points. Ensure the chart distinguishes between states
  within the US and those outside using color variations.
