initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart to visualize the imports and exports of
  dogs by state using the data. The x-axis should represent the states, and the y-axis
  should represent the number of dogs (both exported and imported). Plot two lines:
  one for the exported dogs and one for the imported dogs. Ensure that you include
  labels for each axis and a legend to differentiate between the exported and imported
  data. Make sure to illustrate the trend clearly over the states, highlighting any
  significant increases or decreases.'
