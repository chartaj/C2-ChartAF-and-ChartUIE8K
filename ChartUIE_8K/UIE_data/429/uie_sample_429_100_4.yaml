initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart that visualizes the imports and exports
  of dogs by state. Use the fields 'location', 'exported', and 'imported' from the
  provided data. The x-axis should represent the different states (location), and
  the y-axis should represent the quantities of dogs. Use two different colors or
  styles to differentiate between 'exported' and 'imported' numbers. Also, make sure
  to label the axes and provide a legend to distinguish between imported and exported
  dogs. This will help in understanding the distribution of dog trade across different
  states.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''exported'' and ''imported'' dogs?

  2. Do you prefer a specific style for the bars (e.g., solid, striped) to differentiate
  between ''exported'' and ''imported'' dogs?

  3. Would you like the states to be ordered alphabetically, by the quantity of exported
  dogs, or by the quantity of imported dogs on the x-axis?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to include data values directly on the bars, or in tooltips when
  hovered over?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have a title? If so, what should the title be?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be for the
  x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  8. Are there any specific design elements that should be included to make the chart
  more accessible or easier to interpret for your audience?'
