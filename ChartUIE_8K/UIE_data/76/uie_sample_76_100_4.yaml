initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of the 'quality'
  column from the Red Wine Quality dataset. I want to see how the different quality
  ratings (values) are spread out in terms of percentages. The dataset pertains to
  the chemistry of red wine, so focus on summarizing the quality ratings' proportions.
  The chart should make it easy to understand which quality ratings are more prevalent.
  Use different colors for each quality rating to make the chart visually appealing
  and clear. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different quality
  ratings?

  2. Should the percentage values be displayed directly on the pie chart slices?

  3. Do you prefer a legend or labels directly on the slices for indicating the quality
  ratings?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the quality ratings to be displayed
  (e.g., ascending, descending)?

  5. Would you like any additional text annotations or titles on the chart?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and title?

  7. Should there be any specific emphasis on certain quality ratings (e.g., highlighting
  top ratings)?

  8. Would you like a specific chart size or aspect ratio?

  9. Should the chart include any background or grid design preferences?'
