initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to compare the contribution of different
  chemical properties to the quality of red wine. Use annotations to highlight specific
  data points such as the highest and lowest volatile acidity, and the average for
  each property. Emphasize the quality distribution across different levels of alcohol
  and sulfur content. This visualization will help in understanding the importance
  of each chemical property in determining wine quality, providing insights for both
  winemakers and consumers. The purpose is to make it easy to identify key factors
  affecting wine quality and guide production improvements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for the different
  chemical properties in the stacked bar chart?

  2. What level of detail would you like for the annotations highlighting the highest
  and lowest volatile acidity and the average for each property?

  3. How would you like the quality distribution across different levels of alcohol
  and sulfur content to be emphasized?

  4. Do you prefer any specific order for displaying the chemical properties in the
  stacked bar chart?

  5. Would you like any particular style or font for the text annotations on the chart?

  6. Are there any specific labeling or axis preferences you would like to mention?

  7. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the annotations to be clear and easy to understand, but I do not
  need them to be overly detailed.

  3. I would like to see the quality distribution across different levels of alcohol
  and sulfur content through distinct color coding or labels.

  4. I do not have a specific order for displaying the chemical properties.

  5. I have no specific preference for the style or font for the text annotations.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart.
