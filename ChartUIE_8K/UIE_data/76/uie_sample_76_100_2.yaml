initial_prompt: Create a box plot to analyze the distribution of chemical properties
  affecting red wine quality. The y-axis should represent different chemical properties
  like fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, etc., and the x-axis should show
  their values. Highlight box plots of properties such as alcohol and pH levels to
  emphasize their role in wine quality. Add annotations to indicate unique or notable
  values and trends. This visualization aims to pinpoint key factors in wine quality,
  aiding in quality control and improvement processes. Provide a clear title indicating
  this is about red wine chemistry and quality.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Are there any specific statistics you would like to see annotated (e.g., mean,
  median, quartiles)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style of annotations (e.g., arrows, text boxes)?

  4. Would you like a legend included in the chart, and if so, where should it be
  placed?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the title''s font size or style?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines, and if so, do you prefer them to be light
  or dark?

  7. Do you want each chemical property listed on the y-axis to be color-coded?

  8. Are there specific ranges or thresholds you want highlighted within the box plots?

  9. Do you prefer box plots to be displayed horizontally or vertically?

  10. Would you like any additional notes or footnotes included in the chart for context?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I am not sure where it should be placed.

  5. I am not sure about the title''s font size or style.

  6. Yes, include grid lines, preferably light ones.

  7. I am not sure about color-coding each chemical property.

  8. I do not know about specific ranges or thresholds.

  9. I prefer the box plots to be displayed horizontally.

  10. I do not know if additional notes or footnotes are needed.'
