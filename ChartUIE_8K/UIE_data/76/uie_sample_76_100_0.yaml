initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of red wine quality.
  Use text annotations to highlight specific data points, such as the most common
  and least common quality scores. Highlight these scores and outliers in different
  colors to draw attention. This visualization will help understand the overall quality
  spread of the wines. Make sure to focus on the key elements that stand out in the
  data. This will be useful for quickly assessing the quality consistency and identifying
  any significant anomalies in red wine chemistry.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram and highlighted
  elements?

  2. Would you like a specific bin width or number of bins for the histogram?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for text annotations?

  4. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or style?

  5. Do you have specific labels or captions for the axes and title?

  6. Are there any specific values for quality scores that you want explicitly highlighted
  besides the most and least common ones?

  7. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding and annotations?'
