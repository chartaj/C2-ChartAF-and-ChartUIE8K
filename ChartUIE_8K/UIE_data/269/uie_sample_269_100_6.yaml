initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the populations of the top 10 countries
  in 2023 from the provided data. Each bar should represent one country, with the
  height corresponding to its 2023 population. The x-axis should list the countries
  (India, China, USA, etc.), and the y-axis should show the population numbers. Additionally,
  color-code the bars by continent to differentiate them easily. Include a legend
  indicating which color corresponds to which continent (Asia, North America, etc.).
  Title the chart "Top 10 Most Populated Countries in 2023."
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the chart title and
  axis labels?

  2. Would you like gridlines on the y-axis to improve readability?

  3. Do you prefer any specific color scheme for the continents?

  4. Should the bars have any particular thickness or spacing between them?

  5. Do you have any preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, angled)?

  6. Would you like to include data labels showing the population numbers on top of
  the bars?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, gridlines on the y-axis would be helpful.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Horizontal orientation for x-axis labels would be good.

  6. Yes, please include data labels showing the population numbers on top of the
