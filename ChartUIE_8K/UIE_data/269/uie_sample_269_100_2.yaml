initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the 2023 population against the
  area (km²) of different countries. Use data-driven annotations to display exact
  population values for the top 3 most populous countries (India, China, and the USA).
  Highlight these three countries using distinctive colors to emphasize their population
  size compared to others. Additionally, annotate the growth rate by coloring dots
  based on growth rate categories. This visualization should help in understanding
  population distribution related to land area, emphasizing significant population
  centers, and their growth trends. Designed for a social-science demographic study.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme used to highlight
  India, China, and the USA?

  2. How would you like to categorize the growth rates for coloring the dots?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the annotations displaying
  exact population values?

  4. Should the scatter plot include grid lines for better readability, and if so,
  any specific style?

  5. Do you prefer any specific dot shapes or sizes for representing the countries
  on the scatter plot?

  6. Would you like a legend to be included for the growth rate categories, and if
  so, where should it be positioned?

  7. Is there a preferred orientation or aspect ratio for the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the axes and overall
  chart?

  9. Should we include any borders or outlines around the highlighted countries?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the scatter plot?

  11. Would you like any additional annotations or notes to be included on the scatter
  plot for context?

  12. Are there any specific aspects related to data accessibility that we should
  consider?'
