initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the world population by country for 2023,
  highlighting the top 3 most populous countries (India, China, USA). Text annotations
  should display the population values and growth rates. The treemap should emphasize
  the relative size of the population across different continents, using color to
  distinguish the continents. Highlights should make the top 3 countries stand out
  prominently. The purpose is to provide a clear and engaging visual comparison of
  population distribution worldwide, serving as an educational tool for understanding
  global demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to distinguish
  between different continents?

  2. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations displaying population
  values and growth rates?

  3. Should the top 3 most populous countries have any special styling, such as bold
  text or a specific color highlight?

  4. Do you want tooltips to provide additional information when hovering over different
  countries?

  5. Would you prefer any specific layout or hierarchy settings for the treemap (e.g.,
  ordered by population, country name)?

  6. Are there any specific border styles or thicknesses you would like to apply between
  the countries or continents in the treemap?

  7. Do you want to include a legend to explain the color coding of the continents?

  8. Should the text annotations be positioned in a specific way (e.g., centered within
  each country''s block, or aligned to a certain corner)?

  9. Would you like to include any additional contextual information, such as continent
  names or regional divisions, in the visualization?'
