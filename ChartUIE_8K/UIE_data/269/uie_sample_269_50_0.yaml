initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the 2023 population data by country,
  continent-wise. Include text annotations to highlight the top three most populous
  countries. Use highlights to emphasize rapid growth and density variations within
  continents. The context revolves around understanding world population distribution
  for social science studies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the treemap?

  2. Should specific continents be represented with distinct colors?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the text annotations?

  4. Would you like to use specific shapes or borders to emphasize certain countries
  or regions?

  5. Is there a particular way you would like to highlight rapid growth and density
  variations within the continents?

  6. Do you prefer to see any specific patterns or textures within the treemap representation?

  7. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like included or customized
  in the visualization?

  8. Would you like the annotated text to include any additional information besides
  the top three most populous countries?

  9. How should the areas of low population density be represented in contrast to
  high population density areas?

  10. Would you prefer a particular layout or arrangement method for the treemap?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I would like to emphasize rapid growth with warm colors and high-density variations
  with bold borders.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Just the top three most populous countries is fine.

  9. I would like low population density areas to be represented with lighter shades.

  10. I do not know.'
