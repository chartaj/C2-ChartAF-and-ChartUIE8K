initial_prompt: Create an area chart illustrating the population growth of India,
  China, and the United States from 1970 to 2023. Use different colors to represent
  each country. The x-axis should display the years, while the y-axis should show
  the population count. Ensure the countries' area sizes are represented in the legend.
  The chart aims to highlight population trends and growth rates across these major
  world populations over the decades. Add clear labels and a title for better understanding.
  Keep the chart simple but informative for a quick comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for each country?

  2. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  3. Would you like any gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be on both
  the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Do you have a preference for the order of countries in the legend?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  6. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the y-axis to start from zero or to be scaled according to the
  data values?

  8. Would you prefer the x-axis labels to be displayed in a specific interval (e.g.,
  every year, every five years)?

  9. Is there a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  10. Do you prefer any specific style for the area fill (e.g., solid, gradient)?'
