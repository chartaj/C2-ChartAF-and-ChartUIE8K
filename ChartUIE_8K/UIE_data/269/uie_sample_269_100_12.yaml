initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map to visualize the 2023 population data for
  each country globally. Use different shades to represent the population densities,
  with darker shades indicating higher populations. Ensure each country is clickable
  to reveal the continent, area, and the population growth rate. Highlight Asia, as
  it contains the most populous countries. The map should also display world percentages
  for top countries. This visualization will be used for social-science research to
  analyze population distribution and growth trends geographically. Accurate representation
  is crucial for insights.
questions: '1. What color scheme preferences do you have for the Choropleth map?

  2. Do you have any preferred shading styles or gradient specifications for representing
  population densities?

  3. How would you like Asia to be highlighted on the map?

  4. What specific information would you like to display when a country is clicked
  (e.g., tooltips, side panel details)?

  5. Are there any preferred fonts or text sizes for labels and annotations on the
  map?

  6. Would you like to include any particular legends or keys for easy interpretation
  of the map?

  7. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the map?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, I have no specific color scheme preference.

  2. I do not know, I have no specific preference for shading styles or gradient specifications.

  3. I would like Asia to be highlighted with perhaps a border or a distinct background
  color to make it stand out.

  4. When a country is clicked, I would like to display a tooltip that shows the continent,
  area, and population growth rate.

  5. I am not sure, I do not have a specific preference for fonts or text sizes.

  6. Yes, I would like to include a legend or key for easy interpretation of the map.

  7. I do not know, I have no preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  map.'
