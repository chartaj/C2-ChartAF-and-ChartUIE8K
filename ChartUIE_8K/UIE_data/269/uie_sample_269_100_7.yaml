initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap to visualize the 2023 population
  data from various countries. Highlight the population density, growth rate, and
  world population percentage for each continent. Use different color intensities
  to represent population density and growth rate. Include a legend to explain the
  color coding. Ensure the map provides an intuitive comparison between regions such
  as Asia, North America, etc. Focus on major countries such as India, China, and
  the United States to illustrate population centers. Add interactive features to
  explore data points for individual countries.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for representing population density
  and growth rate?

  2. Do you have specific color intensities in mind for different ranges of population
  density and growth rate?

  3. Would you like to emphasize any particular continents or countries besides India,
  China, and the United States?

  4. How would you like the legend to be formatted? Do you prefer it to be positioned
  at a specific location on the map?

  5. Are there any specific labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  map for better clarity?

  6. Do you have any preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  etc.)?

  7. Would you like to include additional visual cues, such as markers or outlines
  for the major countries?'
answers: '1. I am not sure which color scheme to use.

  2. I do not have specific color intensities in mind for different ranges.

  3. I do not know if there are any other countries to emphasize.

  4. I prefer the legend to be positioned at the bottom right of the map.

  5. I am not sure about specific labels or annotations.

  6. I do not have any preference for the map projection type.

  7. Yes, please include markers or outlines for the major countries like India, China,
  and the United States.'
