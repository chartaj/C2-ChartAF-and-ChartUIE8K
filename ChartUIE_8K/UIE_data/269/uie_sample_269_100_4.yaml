initial_prompt: 'Create a grouped bar chart to compare the population growth of India,
  China, and the United States from 1970 to 2023. Use different bars to represent
  the years: 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015, 2020, 2022, and 2023. Place each
  country side by side for each year to make comparisons easier. Ensure the y-axis
  represents population in billions and label it clearly. Color code each country
  for distinction, and provide a legend. Title the chart "Population Growth Over Time
  by Country".'
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each country?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines for better visual alignment between bars?

  3. Do you want to display the exact population numbers on top of each bar?

  4. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the chart title, axis labels,
  and legend?

  5. Should the y-axis start at zero, or is it acceptable to adjust the scale to better
  visualize differences?

  6. Are there any specific design elements you want to include, such as annotations
  or reference lines?

  7. Would you like the chart to highlight specific years or milestones with different
  styling (e.g., bold or different color)?

  8. Is there a preferred layout for the legend (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?

  9. Should there be any additional labels or descriptions explaining the data sources?

  10. Are there any accessibility considerations we should take into account, such
  as colorblind-friendly palettes?'
