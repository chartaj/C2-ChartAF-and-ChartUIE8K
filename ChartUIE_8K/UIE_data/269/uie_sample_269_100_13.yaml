initial_prompt: I want a Population Pyramid chart for the World data population. Use
  historical population data from different years (1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, 2015,
  2020, 2022, 2023) across countries (India, China, United States). Structure the
  pyramid by continents (Asia, North America) for comparative analysis. Ensure the
  chart highlights population growth trends and age distribution over these periods.
  Include density (km²) and growth rate percentages for additional insights. Visualize
  how populations have expanded or contracted across continents and major countries.
  Make the chart colorful and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or color scheme for the
  chart?

  2. Is there a preferred layout for the population pyramid (e.g., side-by-side comparison
  for continents)?

  3. Should the chart focus more on age distribution or population growth trends,
  or balance both equally?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart''s age group intervals (e.g., 5-year or
  10-year intervals)?

  5. Would you prefer any specific labels or annotations on the chart for key data
  points or trends?

  6. Should the growth rates and density be displayed as overlays, or in separate
  sections of the chart?

  7. Would you like to see any particular emphasis on certain years or trends within
  the data?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart’s title and axis labels?

  9. Are there any additional statistical information or KPIs you would like to include
  on the chart?

  10. Do you prefer the chart to include a legend or any other specific details for
  better interpretation?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Side-by-side comparison for continents would be great.

  3. Balance both equally.

  4. 5-year intervals.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Overlays would be preferred.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No specific preferences.

  10. I do not know.'
