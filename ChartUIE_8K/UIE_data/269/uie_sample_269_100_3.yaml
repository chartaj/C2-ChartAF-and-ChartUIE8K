initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart visualizing the population growth rates across
  different continents from 1970 to 2023, based on the provided world population dataset.
  Please ensure the x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis indicates the population
  numbers. Different continents should be color-coded for clarity. We need to visualize
  trends over the decades to understand how the population growth rate varies for
  each continent. Please make sure the box chart includes data points for major population
  milestones and outliers for deeper insights into population dynamics over time.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used for different
  continents?

  2. Should the box plots for each continent be displayed separately or on a single
  combined chart?

  3. Do you prefer to show individual data points within the box plots?

  4. What major population milestones do you want to be specifically highlighted?

  5. How would you like the outliers to be marked or distinguished in the chart?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you want the continents to be displayed?

  7. Do you want to include any specific annotations or labels for certain data points
  or trends?

  8. Would you like to add any reference lines or bands to indicate significant population
  thresholds or events?

  9. Do you have any specific format or style preferences for the x-axis and y-axis
  labels?

  10. Should there be a title and subtitles on the chart? If so, do you have any specific
  text in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I prefer a single combined chart.

  3. Yes, I prefer to show individual data points within the box plots.

  4. Major population milestones like reaching 1 billion, 2 billion, etc., should
  be highlighted.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, please include a title. Something like "Population Growth Rates Across
  Continents (1970-2023)". Subtitles are not necessary.'
