initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the population growth of countries over
  the decades. Use columns 'country' and 'year' to map the population changes. Highlight
  countries with significant growth or decline. For clarity, ensure color gradients
  represent growth rates from 1970 to 2023. Also, include a legend explaining the
  colors. Provide an overall view of how populations have evolved continent-wise.
  Ensure the heatmap is granular enough to show differences at the country level but
  aggregated to continents for broader trends. This will help in analyzing global
  and regional demographic changes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes in mind for representing the
  growth rates?

  2. Should we include any specific annotations or callouts for countries with significant
  growth or decline?

  3. Do you prefer a particular range for the color gradients (e.g., green for growth,
  red for decline)?

  4. How many color intervals would you like the legend to have for better clarity?

  5. Would you like to include any reference lines or markers indicating specific
  years of interest?

  6. Should the heatmap display countries in any specific order (e.g., alphabetical,
  by growth rate, etc.)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  horizontal or vertical)?

  8. Would you like to see any additional context or overlays, such as population
  density or area size, included in the heatmap?

  9. Are there any specific continents or regions you want to highlight or focus on
  more prominently?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include annotations or callouts for countries with significant growth
  or decline.

  3. Green for growth and red for decline would be preferred.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. By growth rate would be preferable.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No additional context or overlays are needed.

  9. No, I have no specific preference.'
