  different continents from 1970 to 2023, based on the provided world population dataset.
  Please ensure the x-axis represents the years, and the y-axis indicates the population
  numbers. Different continents should be color-coded for clarity. We need to visualize
  trends over the decades to understand how the population growth rate varies for
  each continent. Please make sure the box chart includes data points for major population
  milestones and outliers for deeper insights into population dynamics over time.
