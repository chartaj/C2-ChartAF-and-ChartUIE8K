initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualizing the distribution of CO2 levels over
  the years. Please use the "CO2[ppm]", "seasonallyAdjusted[ppm]", "fit[ppm]", "seasonallyAdjustedFit[ppm]",
  "CO2Filled[ppm]", and "seasonallyAdjustedFilled[ppm]" columns from the dataset,
  and plot them against the "Yr" values to showcase variations and outliers in CO2
  measurements over the different years. The box chart should highlight any significant
  trends or anomalies in CO2 levels, considering environmental changes over time.
  Include appropriate labels for the x-axis (Year) and y-axis (CO2 levels [ppm]).
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you want the chart to include a title? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  4. Are there specific years or ranges of years you''d like to highlight in the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any particular style for the outliers (e.g., different colors,
  shapes)?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the various CO2 columns?

  7. Would you like to add annotations for certain significant trends or anomalies?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for axis labels and titles?

  9. Should the chart include data points overlaid on the box plots for more detailed
  insights?

  10. Do you want to set specific limits for the y-axis to manage the scale of CO2
  levels?'
