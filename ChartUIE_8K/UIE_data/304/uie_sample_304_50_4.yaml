initial_prompt: 'Create a box plot for CO2[ppm] vs year using the data from the Scripps
  CO2 program. Include seasonallyAdjusted[ppm] as a secondary box for comparison.
  Title: "CO2 Levels Over Time".'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plots?

  2. Would you like each year to have distinctly colored or patterned boxes for ''CO2[ppm]''
  and ''seasonallyAdjusted[ppm]''?

  3. Do you want any specific font style or size for the title, axes labels, and legend?

  4. Should the y-axis be labeled with specific units (e.g. ''ppm'')?

  5. Would you like grid lines or a specific background color for the plot area?

  6. Do you want to include any annotations or markers for significant data points
  or trends?

  7. Do you prefer a particular layout or spacing between the boxes for each year?

  8. Should the box plot include whiskers, and if so, what range should they represent
  (e.g., min/max, 1.5 IQR)?

  9. Would you like a brief summary or explanation text to accompany the chart for
  context?'
