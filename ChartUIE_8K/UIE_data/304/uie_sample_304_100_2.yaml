initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of CO2 levels (CO2[ppm])
  over time. The x-axis should represent the 'Date' with a granularity of years, and
  the y-axis should represent the frequency of CO2 measurements. Annotate the histogram
  with specific data points that have the highest and lowest CO2 levels to highlight
  extremes and trends. Use highlights to emphasize periods with significant changes
  in CO2 levels. This visualization will help understand the long-term trends and
  seasonal variations in CO2 levels as documented by the Scripps CO2 program.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the histogram bars and
  highlights?

  2. Would you like to see specific annotations or labels for data points with the
  highest and lowest CO2 levels, and if so, how detailed should they be?

  3. How would you prefer the axis labels and titles to be formatted?

  4. Do you have any preference for the style or appearance of the highlights used
  to emphasize periods with significant changes in CO2 levels?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  6. Would you like a grid to be displayed in the background of the histogram?

  7. Would you prefer any specific bin width for the histogram?

  8. Do you have a preference for the appearance of the histogram''s legend, if one
  is necessary?

  9. Is there a specific way you would like outliers or extreme values to be visualized?'
answers: '1. I don''t have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would like to see annotations for the highest and lowest CO2 levels. The
  details can be basic, indicating the date and the CO2 value.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have a preference for the highlights'' style or appearance.

  5. I do not have any specific preferences for fonts or font sizes.

  6. Yes, a grid would be helpful in the background.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not have a preference for the histogram''s legend appearance.

  9. I do not know.'
