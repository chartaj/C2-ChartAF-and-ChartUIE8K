2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart showing the trend of atmospheric CO2 concentration over the
  years using the "Date" and "CO2[ppm]" columns. Additionally, include seasonally
  adjusted CO2 values from the "seasonallyAdjusted[ppm]" column to highlight seasonal
  variations. Add annotations to emphasize key data points, especially where there
  are significant changes or deviations, by highlighting the relevant CO2 values.
  The purpose of this visualization is to analyze historical CO2 trends and understand
  seasonal fluctuations within the context of environmental science research. Use
  a clear legend to differentiate between actual and seasonally adjusted CO2 measurements.
