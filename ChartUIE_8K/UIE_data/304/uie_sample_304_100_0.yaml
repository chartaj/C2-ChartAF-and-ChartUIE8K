initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the trend of atmospheric CO2 concentration
  over the years using the "Date" and "CO2[ppm]" columns. Additionally, include seasonally
  adjusted CO2 values from the "seasonallyAdjusted[ppm]" column to highlight seasonal
  variations. Add annotations to emphasize key data points, especially where there
  are significant changes or deviations, by highlighting the relevant CO2 values.
  The purpose of this visualization is to analyze historical CO2 trends and understand
  seasonal fluctuations within the context of environmental science research. Use
  a clear legend to differentiate between actual and seasonally adjusted CO2 measurements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing actual and seasonally adjusted CO2 measurements?

  2. Are there any particular time intervals you would prefer on the x-axis (e.g.,
  yearly, quarterly)?

  3. Do you prefer specific styles or designs for the annotations used to emphasize
  key data points and deviations?

  4. Do you have a preferred format or style for the legend that differentiates between
  actual and seasonally adjusted CO2 measurements?

  5. Are there any specific font preferences for the chart labels, legend, or annotations?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability of data points?

  7. Would you like to include a title or subtitle for the chart? If so, please specify
  the text.'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color scheme.

  2. I do not know which time intervals would be best.

  3. I prefer simple and clear annotations for key data points.

  4. I have no specific preference for the legend format.

  5. I do not have any specific font preferences.

  6. Yes, include gridlines for better readability of data points.

  7. Yes, please include a title. The title could be "Historical Trends and Seasonal
  Variations in Atmospheric CO2 Concentration".
