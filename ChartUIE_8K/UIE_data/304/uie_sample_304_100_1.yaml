initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize CO2 concentration data over time.
  Use 'Date' on the x-axis and 'CO2[ppm]' on the y-axis. Highlight the bars where
  CO2 levels are abnormally high (above a certain threshold, e.g., 400 ppm) by changing
  their color. Add text annotations to these highlighted bars to display exact CO2
  values. This chart will help us track CO2 trends and identify significant spikes,
  emphasizing environmental concerns related to climate change as per the Scripps
  CO2 program data.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the bars representing normal
  CO2 levels?

  2. What color would you prefer for the bars indicating abnormally high CO2 levels?

  3. Would you like the background of the chart to be a specific color or remain plain?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations
  on the highlighted bars?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels have a specific font style or size?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, what style and color do you prefer
  for the gridlines?

  7. Do you want a legend included in the chart? If yes, do you have any specific
  preferences for its placement and style?

  8. Do you have a preference for the range of the y-axis, or should it be automatically
  determined based on the data?

  9. Do you have a preference for the date format on the x-axis (e.g., year only,
  month/year)?

  10. Should there be a title for the chart? If so, do you have a specific title in
  mind and any preferences for its font style and size?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. Red would be great for the bars indicating abnormally high CO2 levels.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, I would prefer gridlines. I am not sure about the style and color.

  7. Yes, please include a legend. I have no specific preferences for its placement
  and style.

  8. It can be automatically determined based on the data.

  9. Month/year format would be good.

  10. Yes, the title should be "CO2 Concentration Over Time". I have no specific preference
  for the font style and size.'
