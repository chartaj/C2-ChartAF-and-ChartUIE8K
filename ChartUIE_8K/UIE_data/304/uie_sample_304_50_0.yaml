initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize CO2 concentration changes from 1958
  to 2021, highlighting important points like first significant rise. Include annotations
  on seasonal adjustments, fits, and filled values. Provide context on environmental
  impact.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to differentiate the lines for raw data, seasonally adjusted data,
  and fitted values with distinct colors or styles?

  3. Should the chart have a title? If so, what title would you prefer?

  4. Do you have any specific labels in mind for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any particular points or events you want to highlight or annotate beyond
  the first significant rise?

  6. Do you have a preference for the placement or style of the annotations?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  9. Do you want the chart to include a trendline or moving average for better visualization
  of the trend?

  10. Are there specific intervals or units you prefer for the x-axis (e.g., yearly,
  monthly)?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, the title should be "CO2 Concentration Changes (1958-2021)".

  4. X-axis: "Year", Y-axis: "CO2 Concentration (ppm)".

  5. The first significant rise and maybe a notable peak or dip if available.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, include grid lines for better readability.

  8. I do not have a preference.

  9. Yes, include a trendline for better visualization of the trend.

  10. Yearly intervals.'
