initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the CO2 levels over time
  using the data from the Scripps CO2 program. Plot 'Date' on the x-axis and 'CO2[ppm]'
  on the y-axis. Highlight different years using different colors. Include trend lines
  for the 'fit[ppm]' data to indicate long-term trends. Add a legend, labels, and
  a title to give context to the data. Ensure that missing values (-99.99) are appropriately
  handled to maintain the integrity of the visual. The chart should help illustrate
  the changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations from 1958 onwards.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  2. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to distinguish different years?

  3. Should the trend lines be linear or would you prefer a different type (e.g.,
  polynomial)?

  4. Are there specific labels you would like for the x-axis (Date) and y-axis (CO2[ppm])?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If so, in which format
  (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  6. Do you prefer the legend to be positioned in a specific location (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  7. Should the scatter plot include markers for data points? If yes, do you have
  a preference for marker style (e.g., circles, squares)?

  8. Would you like to use a logarithmic scale for either axis?

  9. How would you like to handle missing values (-99.99)? Should they be removed,
  or would you prefer an alternative method (e.g., interpolation)?

  10. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. Linear trend lines would be fine.

  4. X-axis: Date, Y-axis: CO2[ppm]

  5. Yes, gridlines in solid format.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, include markers for data points. I have no specific preference for marker
  style.

  8. No, a logarithmic scale is not needed.

  9. Remove the missing values (-99.99).

  10. I am not sure.'
