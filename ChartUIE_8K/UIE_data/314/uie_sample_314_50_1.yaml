initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the distribution of possum
  populations by site, sex, and age. Include annotations for the maximum and minimum
  values to draw attention. Highlight unique populations and sites for clarity. The
  purpose of the visualization is to understand the demographic distribution of possums
  for ecological research.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you like the unique populations and sites to be highlighted (e.g.,
  different colors, patterns, or labels)?

  3. Do you prefer specific labels or annotations for the maximum and minimum values
  (e.g., arrows, text on the bars)?

  4. What level of detail are you expecting in the age categories (e.g., specific
  age ranges or exact ages)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend explaining the different categories (site,
  sex, age, and Pop)?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which the categories (site, sex, age,
  and Pop) should be stacked in the bars?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for labels and annotations
  on the chart?

  8. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, in what
  style?

  9. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the chart to provide
  context to the audience?'

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the order of categories.

  7. I do not know.
