initial_prompt: I need a line chart that shows the growth patterns in different physical
  attributes of possums based on the provided data. The X-axis should represent the
  age of the possums, while the Y-axis should show the measurements like head length
  (hdlngth), skull width (skullw), total length (totlngth), and tail length (taill).
  Can you plot separate lines for each attribute to compare their growth trends with
  respect to age? Highlight any missing values in the age data. Please ensure the
  chart is clear and easy to analyze the growth trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the lines representing
  each physical attribute?

  2. Would you like the lines to be solid, dotted, or dashed?

  3. Are there any specific marker styles you would like to use for the data points?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend, and if so, do you have a preferred location
  for it on the chart?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart, and if so, should they be both horizontal
  and vertical?

  7. How would you like missing values in the age data to be highlighted (e.g., with
  a different color, a specific marker, or annotations)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the range or scale of the Y-axis? For example, should
  it start at zero or be auto-scaled based on the data?

  9. Should the X-axis have specific intervals or ticks for the age values, or should
  it be auto-scaled as well?

  10. Would you like to add any specific annotations or reference lines to the chart
  for better context or analysis?'
