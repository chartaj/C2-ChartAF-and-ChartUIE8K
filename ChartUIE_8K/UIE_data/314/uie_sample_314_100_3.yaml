initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to "Possum Regression" with various measurements
  such as head length, skull width, total length, tail length, foot length, ear conch,
  eye size, chest size, and belly size. I'd like to visualize this data using a series
  of box plots. Can you create a set of box charts for each of these measurements
  to show the distribution across different sites? Please include separate plots for
  male and female possums and highlight any outliers. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box plots?

  2. Would you prefer the box plots to be arranged in a single chart or as individual
  charts for each measurement?

  3. Do you have a specific order in which the measurements should be displayed?

  4. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to include for the charts?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between male and female possums,
  or should it be displayed in another manner?

  6. Is there a specific way you would like the outliers to be highlighted?

  7. What axis labels and formatting would you prefer for the box plots?

  8. Do you have any preferred chart dimensions or aspect ratio?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences.

  2. Individual charts for each measurement would be preferred.

  3. I do not have a specific order.

  4. I do not have any specific labels or titles in mind.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to differentiate between male and female possums.

  6. I am not sure, but highlighting them clearly would be helpful.

  7. Basic axis labels indicating the measurement type and units would be good.

  8. I do not have any preferred dimensions or aspect ratio.'
