initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing information about Possum regression in
  zoology, including variables like skull width, head length, tail length, and others.
  I want to visualize the relationship between the head length (hdlngth) and the skull
  width (skullw) using a scatter plot. The x-axis should represent the head length
  and the y-axis should represent the skull width. Additionally, can you color-code
  the points by the sex (male or female) of the possums? This will help me understand
  any differences between male and female possums in terms of these two measurements.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing between male and
  female possums?

  2. Do you have a specific title for the scatter plot?

  3. Are there any particular labels or annotations you would like to include on the
  axes?

  4. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the legend?

  5. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preference for the size and shape of the scatter plot points?

  7. Would you like to include a trend line to highlight the correlation between head
  length and skull width?

  8. Are there specific axis ranges you would like to set for the head length (x-axis)
  and skull width (y-axis)?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text in the chart?

  10. Do you want to display any statistical measures (like correlation coefficient)
  on the chart?'
