initial_prompt: 'I have data on possums from a zoology study, including various measurements
  like head length, skull width, and total length categorized by different populations
  and sexes. I want to visualize the distribution of possum measurements to understand
  variations better. Please create a histogram for each of the following variables:
  ''hdlngth'' (head length), ''skullw'' (skull width), and ''totlngth'' (total length).
  Ensure the histograms show the frequency distribution of the measurements and are
  color-coded by sex. Also, indicate any missing values in the data.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for differentiating between
  sexes?

  2. Would you like the bins for the histograms to be of a specific width or number?

  3. Should missing values be indicated with a specific symbol or color in the chart?

  4. Do you want any additional annotations, such as mean or median lines, on the
  histograms?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you want the histograms to be displayed?

  6. Do you need specific labels or titles for each histogram?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the histograms for better readability, and if so,
  to what extent?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, indicate missing values with a specific color in the chart.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific order in mind.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, I would like gridlines for better readability.'
