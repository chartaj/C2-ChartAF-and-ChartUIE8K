initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the distribution of 'Pop'
  values across various 'site' and 'sex' categories from the provided possum dataset.
  Use annotations to highlight the specific counts of 'Pop' across different 'site'
  and 'sex' combinations to draw attention to significant patterns or outliers. The
  visualization should help in understanding demographic variations in the possum
  population. Make sure that the chart and annotations are easily readable, as this
  will enable quick insights into the demographic data.
