initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap visualizing possum populations, emphasizing
  differences by site and population type. Highlight locations with the most significant
  skull width variations. Add annotations for the top and bottom three locations for
  skull width. Use colors to distinguish population types and highlight unique site
  identifiers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between population
  types?

  2. Would you like the map to include a legend explaining the colors and symbols
  used?

  3. Do you prefer specific symbols or shapes to be used for unique site identifiers?

  4. How would you like the annotations for the top and bottom three locations for
  skull width to be displayed (e.g., text, markers)?

  5. Would you like to include any specific geographic boundaries or regions on the
  map?

  6. Are there any particular map styles (e.g., satellite, terrain) you prefer for
  the geographic heatmap?

  7. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the annotations and labels?

  8. Should the heatmap include a scale or intensity indicator for skull width variations?

  9. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for the heatmap (e.g., Mercator,
  Albers)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the map on the
  visualization?'
