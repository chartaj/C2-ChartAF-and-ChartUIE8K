initial_prompt: 'I need a line chart to visualize the stock performance of Quantum
  Computing Inc. (QUBT) over time. The x-axis should represent the date (from the
  column "Unnamed: 0"), and the y-axis should show the closing prices ("close"). Please
  ensure that each data point clearly indicates the data with no missing values or
  gaps. Also, include the volume of traded stock ("volume") as a secondary y-axis
  to depict trading activity alongside the closing prices. Make the chart interactive
  if possible, to allow zooming in on specific time periods and viewing more detailed
  data points.'

  closing prices and trading volume?

  circles, squares)?

  4. Do you prefer the axis labels to be in a specific format (e.g., date format on

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the closing prices
  and trading volume?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Would you like any annotations or markers for significant events or dates?

  8. Do you have any specific size or aspect ratio preferences for the chart?
