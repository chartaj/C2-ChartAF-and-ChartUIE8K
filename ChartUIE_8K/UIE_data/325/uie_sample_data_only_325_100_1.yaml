09_answers: '1. I am not sure about a preferred color scheme for significant price
  changes or trends.

  2. I would like annotated the dates when quarterly earnings were reported, major
  product launches, or significant stock price spikes/drops occurred.

  3. Short labels for the annotations would be fine.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  5. I think gridlines and a legend would be helpful.

  6. I am not sure about a specific date range.

  7. I have no specific preference regarding the overall style and design of the chart.'
