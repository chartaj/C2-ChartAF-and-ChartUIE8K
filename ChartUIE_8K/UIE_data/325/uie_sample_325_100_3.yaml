initial_prompt: Create a histogram for the stock price data of Quantum Computing Inc.
  (QUBT). The histogram should show the distribution of the 'close' prices. Make sure
  to label the axes properly, with the x-axis representing the closing prices and
  the y-axis representing the frequency of those prices occurring. Use appropriate
  bin sizes to ensure the histogram is readable and informative. Highlight the range
  of prices where the highest frequency occurs. Include a title for the chart that
  clearly states it is for QUBT stock closing price distribution.
