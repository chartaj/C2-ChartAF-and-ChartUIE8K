initial_prompt: 'I would like a heatmap to visualize the price movements of Quantum
  Computing Inc. (QUBT) over time. Specifically, the heatmap should show the correlation
  between the daily ''open'', ''high'', ''low'', ''close'', and ''adjclose'' prices.
  The x-axis should represent the dates (use ''Unnamed: 0''), and the y-axis should
  represent the different price types. Color intensity in each cell should reflect
  the price magnitude on each day. This heatmap will help me understand how these
  price types relate over the given period. Please ensure every date and price type
  is accurately represented.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme in mind for the heatmap?

  2. What range of dates would you like the heatmap to cover?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the dates on the x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis labels for different price types include any additional information,
  such as units or abbreviations?

  5. Would you like any annotations or highlights for specific dates or price types
  on the heatmap?

  6. Do you have any preference for the heatmap''s aspect ratio or size?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color intensities and their
  corresponding price magnitudes?

  8. Do you want any gridlines or borders between the cells for better visual separation?'

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the heatmap to cover the last 1 year.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the date labeling format.

  4. I am not sure about including additional information on the y-axis labels, but
  it should be clear that they are price types.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the aspect ratio or size.

  7. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color intensities and their corresponding
  price magnitudes.

  8. I do not know.
