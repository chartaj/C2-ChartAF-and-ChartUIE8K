initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the average per capita supply of
  calories by highlighting the data for Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy,
  United States, Hong Kong, and Australia. Use different colors for each country.
  Add text annotations for notable points, such as the highest and lowest calorie
  values, to emphasize these data points. The chart should be clear and focus on visualizing
  the trend of calorie supply among the countries over the given timeframe, helping
  to understand dietary patterns in different regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different countries to
  ensure distinction?

  2. Are there specific time intervals or granularity (e.g., yearly, monthly) that
  you want on the x-axis?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included for better readability? If so, should
  they be for both axes or just one?

  4. Is there a preferred style for the text annotations (e.g., font size, font color,
  placement)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if yes, where would you prefer it to be
  placed (e.g., top, bottom, side)?

  6. Are there specific labels or titles you want for the axes and the chart itself?

  7. Would you prefer the lines to have markers at each data point, or should they
  be smooth continuous lines?

  8. Is there a specific background color or theme you prefer for the chart?

  9. Do you want any specific point shapes for the highest and lowest values (e.g.,
  stars, circles)?

  10. Should the chart include data labels for each data point, or just the notable
  points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yearly intervals would be good.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, a legend should be included. I have no specific preference for its placement.

  6. Yes, label the x-axis as "Year" and the y-axis as "Average Calories per Capita".
  The chart title should be "Average Per Capita Supply of Calories by Country".

  7. Smooth continuous lines are preferable.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Stars for the highest and lowest values would be nice.

  10. Just the notable points should have data labels.'
