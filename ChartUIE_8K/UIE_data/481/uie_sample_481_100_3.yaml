initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the average per capita supply of calories
  from different components (total calories, carbohydrates, fat, animal protein) across
  the listed countries (Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy, United States,
  Hong Kong, Australia). Use the data for each country to show the distribution and
  range of calorie supply for each food component. This will help compare the nutritional
  intake profiles among the countries. Include all relevant countries and ensure each
  component is clearly labeled for comparison. The chart should help visualize variations
  and trends in dietary composition.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing between
  different food components?

  2. Would you like any specific countries to be highlighted in the chart?

  3. Do you prefer a particular order for the countries to be displayed on the chart
  (e.g., alphabetical, by continent)?

  4. Are there any specific labels or titles you would like to use for the axes and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to include any specific statistical annotations on the box chart
  (e.g., mean, median)?

  6. Do you have preferences for the style of the box plots (e.g., classic, minimalist)?

  7. Is there a particular font style or size you would prefer for the labels and
  titles?'
