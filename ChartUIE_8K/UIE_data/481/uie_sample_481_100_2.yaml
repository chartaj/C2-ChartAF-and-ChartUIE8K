initial_prompt: Create a radar chart visualizing the average per capita supply of
  calories, fat, carbohydrates, and animal protein across Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China,
  Germany, Italy, United States, Hong Kong, and Australia. Annotations should highlight
  key observations, such as countries with the highest and lowest values in each category,
  emphasizing specific health and nutritional trends. The chart should use color highlights
  to distinguish each country, making it easy to compare food supply data across different
  nations. This visualization will effectively communicate the nutritional landscape
  and comparative health metrics of various countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting each country?

  2. Is there a particular style you prefer for annotations (e.g., labels, callouts,
  tooltips)?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the radar chart have axis labels, gridlines, or both?

  5. Do you want specific legend placement or style for distinguishing countries?

  6. Is there a preferred way to handle overlapping text or data points?

  7. Do you have a preference for how the data scales are presented on the radar chart?

  8. Are there any specific highlights or insights you want to be particularly prominent?'

  2. Labels or callouts would be good, I am not sure.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.
