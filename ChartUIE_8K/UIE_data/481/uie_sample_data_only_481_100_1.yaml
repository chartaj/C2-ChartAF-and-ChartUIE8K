09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yearly intervals would be good.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, a legend should be included. I have no specific preference for its placement.

  6. Yes, label the x-axis as "Year" and the y-axis as "Average Calories per Capita".
  The chart title should be "Average Per Capita Supply of Calories by Country".

  7. Smooth continuous lines are preferable.

  8. I do not know.

  9. Stars for the highest and lowest values would be nice.

  10. Just the notable points should have data labels.'
