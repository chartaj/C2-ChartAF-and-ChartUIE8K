initial_prompt: 'Create a Choropleth map visualizing the average per capita supply
  of calories for Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy, United States, Hong
  Kong, and Australia. Use colors to highlight differences in calorie supply between
  countries. Important elements should be annotated, such as Rwanda’s low average
  and the United States’ high average. Highlights with different shades or colors
  should visually distinguish countries with the highest and lowest values. The map
  should serve a dual purpose: showing overall caloric distribution by country and
  focusing on significant exceptions or patterns in the data.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for highlighting the differences
  in calorie supply between countries?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or tooltips for each country''s value?

  3. Is there a particular map projection you prefer for the Choropleth map (e.g.,
  Mercator, Robinson)?

  4. Should the map include borders or demarcations of individual countries?

  5. Do you want a legend explaining the color gradients used in the Choropleth map?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the annotations?'
