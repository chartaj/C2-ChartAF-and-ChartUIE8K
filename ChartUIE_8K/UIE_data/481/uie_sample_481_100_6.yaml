initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart that displays the average per capita
  supply of calories for different countries. I want to compare the values for different
  types of nutrients like carbohydrates, fat, and animal protein across several countries
  such as Rwanda, Egypt, Niger, China, Germany, Italy, United States, Hong Kong, and
  Australia. Each bar group should represent a country, and within each group, there
  should be separate bars for carbohydrates, fat, and animal protein. This will help
  in visualizing the variations in nutritional supply among these countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  carbohydrates, fat, and animal protein?

  2. Would you like to include data labels on each bar for precise values?

  3. How would you prefer the countries to be ordered on the chart (e.g., alphabetically,
  by geographical region, by supply of a specific nutrient)?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for easier reading of the bar heights?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the chart''s title and
  labels?

  6. Would you like a legend to identify the different types of nutrients, and if
  so, do you have any specific preferences for its placement?

  7. Should any additional annotations or notes be included on the chart? For instance,
  specifying the data source.

  8. Do you require any specific margin or padding settings around the chart?

  9. Would you like to see error bars or confidence intervals included on the bars?

  10. Are there any other specific attributes or elements you would like to include
  or highlight in the chart?'
