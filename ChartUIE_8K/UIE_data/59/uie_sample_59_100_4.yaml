initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the historical stock prices of GameStop.
  The chart should include the distribution of open price, high price, low price,
  close price, and adjusted close price from the dataset. Ensure each box plot is
  properly labeled with outliers, median, and quartiles. The x-axis should represent
  the different types of prices (open, high, low, close, adj close), and the y-axis
  should show the price values. This will help in comparing the spread and central
  tendency of these prices over time. Use different colors for each box plot for better
  distinction.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for each box plot?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be marked with a specific symbol or shape?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the thickness of the lines in the box plot?

  4. Should the box plots include notches to indicate confidence intervals around
  the median?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the price categories (open, high, low,
  close, adj close) to be displayed in on the x-axis?

  6. Would you like any annotations or labels on the chart, such as highlighting specific
  historical events?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the labels and titles on the
  chart?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the entire chart?

  9. Are there any additional elements you would like to include in the chart legend?

  10. Do you have preferences for the background color or grid lines on the chart?

  11. Would you like to include a trend line or any other supplementary data in the
  chart?'
