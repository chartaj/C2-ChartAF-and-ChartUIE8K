2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a scatter plot visualizing GameStop's historical stock prices over
  time. The x-axis should represent the date, and the y-axis should show the closing
  prices. Highlight significant events where the stock had unusual spikes or drops
  in volume. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight dates with extreme high
  or low prices to direct attention to these points. This visualization will help
  in analyzing the price movement patterns and understand how specific events impacted
  stock performance over a period of time. Thank you!
