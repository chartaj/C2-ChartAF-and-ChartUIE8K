initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the distribution of different
  races across countries, highlighting demographic hotspots. Consider "race" and "country"
  columns as primary layers, depicting concentrations and diversity in the dataset.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or palettes for the heatmap?\n\
  2. Would you like to emphasize any specific countries or regions on the map?\n3.\
  \ Should the heatmap display absolute counts or normalized percentages for race\
  \ distribution?\n4. Do you prefer specific labeling or annotations for countries\
  \ or demographic hotspots?\n5. What level of granularity do you prefer for the geographic\
  \ regions (e.g., country level, state/province level)?\n6. Do you have a preferred\
  \ geographic projection for the map (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)? \n7. Would you like\
  \ to display any specific legends or key information about race distributions?\n\
  8. Are there specific thresholds for demographic hotspots that you would like to\
  \ define or highlight?\n9. Should the heatmap show race diversity within countries\
  \ as gradients or another form?\n10. Do you have any preferences for the style or\
  \ design of the map borders and background?"
