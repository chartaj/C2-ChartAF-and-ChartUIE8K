initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the relationship between "age"
  and "total years" for individuals in the dataset. The x-axis should represent the
  age groups (in intervals of 5 years), and the y-axis should represent the average
  total years. Differentiate bars by gender to see any gender-based trends or differences
  within each age group. Include labels and a legend for clarity. This chart will
  help understand how total lifetime years vary with age and gender in the context
  of Trolley Dilemma, ethics, and philosophy. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  different genders?

  2. How would you like the age group intervals (5 years) to be labeled on the x-axis
  (e.g., "20-25", "25-30")?

  3. Do you prefer a certain font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like to include error bars to show variability in the average total
  years?

  5. Is there a particular style or format you prefer for the legend?

  6. Are there any specific title or subtitle preferences for the chart?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, what style do you prefer for them?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the orientation of the labels on the x-axis (e.g.,
  horizontal, vertical, or angled)?

  9. Would you like to include data values on top of each bar for more precise information?

  10. Is there a specific layout or positioning you prefer for the chart and legend
  (e.g., legend at the top, bottom, or side)?'
