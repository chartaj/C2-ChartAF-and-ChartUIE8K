initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the aging and expected years
  left for individuals based on their gender. The X-axis should display the age, and
  the Y-axis should show the expected years left. Different lines should represent
  male and female genders. Add text annotations to highlight data points where the
  individual's total years exceed 50. Use highlights to differentiate between ages
  20-30 and ages 60-70 to compare how the expected years left changes in these age
  brackets. This chart should aid in understanding the impact of gender on life expectancy
  over different age ranges.

  male and female)?
