initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap for the Trolley Dilemma dataset. Emphasize age,
  expected_years_left, total_years, IQ, and health in the heatmap cells. Use text
  annotations for unique values in the columns like job, skill, race, and country.
  Highlight killer and contribution_to_humanity columns' values. This heatmap should
  aid in understanding the ethical and philosophical implications by focusing on the
  relation between demographics, mental and physical health, criminal behavior, and
  societal contributions. Keep the visualization clear and focused on differentiating
  the elements to explore ethical perspectives effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Should certain ranges of values for the variables be specifically color-coded?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for unique values to be formatted? (e.g.,
  font size, color, style)

  4. What specific method of highlighting would you prefer for the ''killer'' and
  ''contribution_to_humanity'' columns? (e.g., different color, bold borders)

  5. Are there any specific thresholds or categories in the ''killer'' and ''contribution_to_humanity''
  columns that should be emphasized more than others?

  6. Do you prefer to include a legend explaining the color scheme and highlights
  used in the heatmap?

  7. Would you like to add any particular titles, subtitles, or caption texts to the
  heatmap for better context?'
