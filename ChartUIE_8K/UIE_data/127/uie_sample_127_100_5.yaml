initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset of ramen reviews with columns like Review #, Brand,
  Variety, Style, Country, Stars, and Top Ten. I want to create a scatter plot to
  visualize the relationship between the ''Stars'' rated by users and the different
  ''Brands'' of ramen noodles. On the X-axis, plot the ''Stars'' ratings, and on the
  Y-axis, plot the different ''Brands''. Different colors can be used to represent
  various ''Styles'' of ramen (e.g., Cup, Pack). This will help in understanding which
  brands generally receive higher ratings and which style is most popular among users.'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different ''Styles''
  of ramen, or should we use a default palette?

  2. Would you like to include a legend that identifies the colors used for different
  ''Styles''?

  3. Is there a preferred order for displaying the ''Brands'' on the Y-axis (e.g.,
  alphabetical, based on average rating)?

  4. Are there any specific brands that you would like to highlight or annotate in
  the scatter plot?

  5. Do you prefer a logarithmic or linear scale for the ''Stars'' ratings on the
  X-axis?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  7. Are there any specific font preferences for axis labels and titles?
