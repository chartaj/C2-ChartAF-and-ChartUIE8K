initial_prompt: Create a box chart depicting the distribution of 'Stars' for different
  'Styles' of ramen across various 'Countries'. Highlight the median and any outliers.
  Annotate the highest and lowest 'Stars' for each 'Style' to draw attention. The
  visualization should emphasize the comparison of quality ratings for different ramen
  'Styles' within and between 'Countries'. Make sure to include a legend for 'Countries'
  and use different colors for different 'Styles'. This will help identify trends
  and outliers in ramen ratings, aiding in better consumer choices and market insights.

  of ramen?
