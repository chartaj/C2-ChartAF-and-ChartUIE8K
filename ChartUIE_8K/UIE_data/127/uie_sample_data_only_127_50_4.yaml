  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

  2. Should the heatmap include labels for each country, or rely solely on the color
  shading?

  3. How many different star rating ranges would you like to depict?

  4. Do you want the color legend to be displayed on the map itself or outside of
  the map?

  5. Are there specific countries you would like to ensure are prominently highlighted
  or labeled?

  6. Would you prefer a particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  7. Should we include additional data points like the number of reviews per country?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the default zoom level of the map (e.g., global
  view, focused on specific regions)?'
