initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot showing the changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide
  levels over time. Use the "Decimal Date" on the X-axis and "Carbon Dioxide (ppm)"
  on the Y-axis. Highlight key points with missing values and provide text annotations
  for the highest and lowest CO2 levels. This visualization will help understand trends
  and anomalies in atmospheric CO2 levels, which is crucial for environmental science.
  Make sure to include a legend and a title for clarity. The chart should be easy
  to understand for both experts and non-experts.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the scatter
  plot?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer specific symbols or shapes for the scatter plot points?

  4. Should the highlighted key points with missing values be marked in a distinct
  way?

  5. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. Would you like the legend to be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  7. Would you prefer a specific title format or specific wording for the chart''s
  title?

  8. Is there a specific scale or range you prefer for the X-axis and Y-axis?

  9. Do you want specific markers or lines to indicate the trends more clearly?'
