initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the trend of Carbon Dioxide levels
  (ppm) by year, highlighting significant changes. Add text annotations for notable
  peaks and dips, and use color highlights to emphasize these data points. Focus on
  the 1958-2023 range.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the line and highlighted
  data points?

  2. Are there any particular styles you prefer for the text annotations (e.g., font
  size, color, background)?

  3. How would you like significant changes to be highlighted? (e.g., markers, shaded
  regions)

  4. Do you prefer gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be on both axes?

  5. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or auto-adjust based on the data?

  6. Would you like to include any specific labels or headings on the chart?

  7. Do you prefer the chart to have a legend or should it be self-explanatory?

  8. Are there specific time intervals you want to be marked on the x-axis (e.g.,
  every 5 years, every decade)?

  9. Would you like to include a trend line along with the data points?

  10. Do you prefer the chart background to be a specific color or pattern?'
