initial_prompt: I would like a histogram visualization for the Carbon Dioxide Levels
  in the atmosphere. Use the data provided to plot the distribution of Carbon Dioxide
  (ppm) over the years. Also, include the Seasonally Adjusted CO2 (ppm) for a clearer
  analysis. Make sure to highlight any missing values in the dataset. The aim is to
  observe the trend and variability of CO2 levels from 1958 to the present. Include
  labels and a legend for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram bars and highlighted
  missing values?

  2. Should the x-axis represent individual years, or would you prefer to group the
  data by a specific time interval (e.g., decades, five-year periods)?

  3. Are there any specific fonts you would like to use for the labels and legend?

  4. Do you prefer a specific layout for the legend, such as horizontal or vertical
  orientation?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the data?

  6. Should the histogram include data labels that show the count of occurrences for
  each bar?

  7. Is there a specific style you prefer for highlighting missing values (e.g., color-coding,
  patterns)?

  8. Do you want any additional annotations or markers to indicate significant events
  or trends in the data?

  9. Are there any specific requirements for the title and subtitle of the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Group the data by decades.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, include grid lines.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Color-coding for missing values would be good.
