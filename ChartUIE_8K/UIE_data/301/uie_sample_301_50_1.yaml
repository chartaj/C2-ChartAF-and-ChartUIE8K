initial_prompt: Create a box chart highlighting monthly carbon dioxide levels from
  1958 to 2017. Include text annotations on key data points and use highlights to
  focus on significant trends. This visualization aims to emphasize the fluctuations
  and trends in atmospheric CO2 levels over time, relevant for environmental science
  research.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like the x-axis to display years, months, or a combination of both?

  3. Do you want specific data points labeled in any particular style or with any
