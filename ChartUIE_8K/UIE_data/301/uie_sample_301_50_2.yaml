initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the atmospheric carbon dioxide
  levels from 1958 to 2018. Highlight and annotate key data points and trends. Ensure
  the graph clearly shows seasonal adjustments and fits.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot and the seasonal
  adjustments/fits?

  2. How would you like the key data points and trends to be highlighted (e.g., different
  markers, colors, or sizes)?

  3. Should the x-axis represent ''Year'' or ''Decimal Date''?

  4. Do you have a specific format for annotations or any specific points you want
  to annotate?

  5. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Should the seasonal adjustments and fits be shown as lines, and if so, do you
  have preferences for their line styles (e.g., solid, dashed)?

  7. Is there a specific title or subtitle you would like for the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any specific axis labels or legends you prefer?

  9. Do you need grid lines on the chart, and if so, do you have preferences for their
  style?

  10. Would you like to have any reference lines or markers (e.g., average CO2 level,
  critical threshold) included in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Different markers for key data points would be nice.

  3. Year.

  4. I do not have a specific format or points in mind.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, lines are fine, but no specific preferences for their styles.

  7. "Atmospheric CO2 Levels (1958-2018)"

  8. No specific preferences.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, an average CO2 level line would be helpful.'
