initial_prompt: I need a step line chart to visualize the performance trends of different
  women's college basketball teams over the years. The x-axis should represent the
  'year' and the y-axis should show 'full_percent'. Different lines should correspond
  to different 'school' teams. Please use colors to distinguish between the teams
  and include a legend. Utilize the data columns like 'reg_w', 'reg_l', 'how_qual',
  and 'tourney_finish' to provide additional insights when hovering over the data
  points. Ensure the chart is interactive and provides a clear representation of how
  each team has progressed over time in terms of winning percentage.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between the
  teams?

  2. How would you like the x-axis to be labeled in terms of font size and style?

  3. What specific styling preferences do you have for the y-axis representing ''full_percent''?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style for the legend (e.g., position, font size)?

  5. How would you like the data points to be represented on the step line (e.g.,
  circles, squares)?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  7. Would you like gridlines to be included, and if so, how prominent should they
  be?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall chart background color?

  9. How should the additional insights like ''reg_w'', ''reg_l'', ''how_qual'', and
  ''tourney_finish'' be displayed when hovering over the data points (e.g., tooltip
  style)?

  10. Do you have preferences for how the step lines themselves should be styled (e.g.,
  line width, dash style)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I have no specific preference.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I prefer the legend to be placed at the bottom with a moderate font size.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, include gridlines but not too prominent.

  8. I am not sure.
