initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart that visualizes the tourney outcomes for
  different schools over the years. Use the 'school' as the x-axis and show tourney_w
  and tourney_l as stacked values. Each bar should represent a school, segmented by
  wins and losses. Use different colors for tourney_w and tourney_l to differentiate
  them. The chart should help quickly identify the performance of each school in the
  tournaments. Ensure the data is clearly labeled and includes a legend for easy understanding.
  The primary audience is sports enthusiasts analyzing women's college basketball
  performance.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the ''tourney_w'' and ''tourney_l''
  segments?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the width of the bars?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like any particular ordering for the schools on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  based on wins/losses)?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  6. Is there any specific formatting you want for the y-axis labels (e.g., percentage,
  count)?

  7. Are there any additional details you would like to include in the chart (e.g.,
  tooltips, annotations)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, maybe use vibrant contrasting colors
  for clarity.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the width of the bars.

  3. I have no specific preference for the fonts or styles, just make sure they are
  readable.

  4. I would like the schools to be ordered based on the total number of wins, from
  highest to lowest.

  5. A preferred title could be "Tourney Outcomes by School Over the Years."

  6. The y-axis labels should be in count format, showing the number of wins and losses.

  7. I do not need any additional details like tooltips or annotations.'
