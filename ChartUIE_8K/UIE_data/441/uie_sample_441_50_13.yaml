initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap showing the performance of women college
  basketball teams by their conference regions. Use regular season and tournament

  for each datapoint.

  map or in a separate legend?

  3. Is there a specific geographic region or map projection you prefer for the geographic
  heatmap?

  4. How many intervals or bins would you like for the winning percentages (e.g.,
  quintiles, deciles)?

  5. Do you want a specific threshold to highlight top-performing teams, such as those
  with winning percentages above a certain value?

  6. Should the regular season and tournament winning percentages be combined into
  a single metric or shown separately?

  7. Is there a particular way you prefer to represent the year data (e.g., as a range,
  individual years)?

  8. Would you like any specific annotations or notes on the map to highlight key
  findings or areas of interest?'
