initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing women's college basketball performance.
  Plot 'school' on the y-axis and 'reg_percent' on the x-axis. Annotate key data points
  to highlight top and bottom performing teams by 'reg_percent'. Use different colors
  to represent 'conference' to show diversity. Include highlights for schools with
  'reg_percent' above 90. Add textual annotations for specific schools that performed
  exceptionally well or poorly in 'tourney_finish'. This visualization will help compare
  team performances across different conferences and identify standout teams in regular
  and tournament play.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for representing different
  conferences?

  2. What style of annotations would you prefer for highlighting key data points (e.g.,
  arrows, labels, callouts)?

  3. Do you have any preferred threshold for highlighting ''reg_percent'' above 90,
  such as using a specific color or shape?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the schools to be sorted on the y-axis
  (e.g., alphabetically, by ''reg_percent'')?

  5. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for textual annotations?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color codes for different conferences?

  7. Is there a specific way you want to handle overlapping data points in the dot
  plot?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s background color or grid
  lines?

  9. Would you like any additional categorical variables to be indicated in the chart,
  such as ''seed'' or ''how_qual''?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the chart (e.g.,
  plotting horizontally or vertically)?'
