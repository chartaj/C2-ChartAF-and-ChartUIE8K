09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, maybe use vibrant contrasting
  colors for clarity.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the width of the bars.

  3. I have no specific preference for the fonts or styles, just make sure they are
  readable.

  4. I would like the schools to be ordered based on the total number of wins, from
  highest to lowest.

  5. A preferred title could be "Tourney Outcomes by School Over the Years."

  6. The y-axis labels should be in count format, showing the number of wins and losses.

  7. I do not need any additional details like tooltips or annotations.'
