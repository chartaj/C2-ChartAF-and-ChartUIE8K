  Plot 'school' on the y-axis and 'reg_percent' on the x-axis. Annotate key data points
  to highlight top and bottom performing teams by 'reg_percent'. Use different colors
  to represent 'conference' to show diversity. Include highlights for schools with
  'reg_percent' above 90. Add textual annotations for specific schools that performed
