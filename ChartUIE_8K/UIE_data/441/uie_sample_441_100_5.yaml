initial_prompt: Please create an area chart for women college basketball teams using
  the given data. The x-axis should represent the "year," and the y-axis should show
  "reg_percent" for regular season performance as different areas for each "school."
  Use different colors for each school to distinguish them. Highlight significant
  peaks and troughs, if any. Ensure the legend includes school names. This will help
  visualize trends over the years for regular-season performance. Thank you!
