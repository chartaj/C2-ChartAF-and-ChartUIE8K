initial_prompt: Create a chart using small multiples to visualize women's college
  basketball performance by year, school, and conference. Include annotations to highlight
  key stats like tournament wins and finishes. Use distinct colors to indicate different
  conferences and emphasize notable achievements, such as high winning percentages
  or unique qualifiers. Add data-driven text annotations to specific schools that
  achieved exceptional full-season win percentages. Ensure the design is reader-friendly
  to help viewers easily compare statistics across different schools and conferences,
  focusing on trends and standout performances in womenâ€™s college basketball.
