09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences for different teams.

  2. Solid lines for ''full_percent'' and dashed lines for ''reg_percent'' should
  work well.

  3. I am not sure about the style for the different teams; you can choose what looks
  best for distinction.

  4. Yearly granularity for the X-axis would be ideal.

  5. Yes, including grid lines for better readability would be good. I don''t have
  a specific preference for their style.

  6. Specific markers for data points on the spline chart would be helpful.

  7. Yes, please include titles and labels for the X-axis and Y-axis. X-axis: "Year",
  Y-axis: "Win Percentage".

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the font style and size for the legend
  and axis labels.

  9. I am not sure about annotations or highlights for specific events or milestones.

  10. No additional information or notes needed.
