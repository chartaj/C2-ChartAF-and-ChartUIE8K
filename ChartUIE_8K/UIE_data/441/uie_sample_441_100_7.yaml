initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing the performance of women's college
  basketball teams. Group by 'year' and 'school', showing bars for 'reg_w', 'reg_l',
  'tourney_w', and 'tourney_l' for each school. This will help visualize the number
  of regular season wins and losses compared to tournament wins and losses for each
  team across different years. Ensure the chart is color-coded by 'school' for clarity,
  and include a legend and axis labels for better understanding. This will be useful
  for comparing the regular season and tournament performances of various teams over
  the years.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you would like to use for different
  schools?

  2. What should be the range for the y-axis? Should it be set automatically or fixed?

  3. Do you have a preference for the bar width?

  4. Would you like to add any specific title to the chart?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  7. Should the axis labels include any additional information or units?

  8. Would you like to display the numerical values at the top of the bars?

  10. Are there any years or schools you would like to highlight or emphasize in the
  chart?'
