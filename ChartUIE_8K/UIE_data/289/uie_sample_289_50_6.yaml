initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the correlation between the various features
  of the cancer classification dataset, specifically focusing on the mean, error,
  and worst values across all measurements. Please include the benign/malignant classification
  for context.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap (e.g., specific
  colors for high and low correlations)?

  2. Would you like to include the actual correlation values as annotations on the
  heatmap cells?

  3. Do you prefer a specific layout or order for the features in the heatmap, or
  should they be organized based on correlation strength?

  4. Should we include any labels or legends to explain the color coding in the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any specific title or description you want to appear above the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific features or correlations within the
  heatmap for clearer emphasis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include the actual correlation values as annotations on the heatmap
  cells.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. No specific title or description.

  6. I do not know.'
