initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the data related to the cancer
  classification from the provided dataset. The chart should include various features
  like mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean area, mean smoothness, and
  others. Each feature should have its own box in the box chart to show the distribution
  and variability. Make sure to include the classification labels (benign or malignant)
  for better comparison. This visualization will help in understanding the spread
  and central tendency of these metrics, aiding in the identification of patterns
  related to cancer diagnosis. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Would you like to display any specific summary statistics (e.g., mean, median)
  on the chart?

  3. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  4. Should the classification labels (benign or malignant) be shown as different
  colors or markers?

  5. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes?

  6. Are there any specific gridlines or background elements you would like to include
  or exclude?

  7. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the chart labels and titles?

  8. Is there a particular way you would like to handle outliers in the data visualization?

  9. Would you like to include annotations or tooltips for additional data insights?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the axes (linear or logarithmic)?'
