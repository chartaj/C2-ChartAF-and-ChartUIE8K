initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart to compare the mean values of 'mean
  radius', 'mean texture', and 'mean area' for benign vs malignant cases in the cancer
  classification dataset.
questions: '1. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars representing benign
  vs malignant cases?

  3. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels?

  4. Do you want the mean values displayed on top of the bars?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the categories (''mean radius'', ''mean
  texture'', ''mean area'') to be plotted?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between benign and malignant
  cases?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the chart''s text
  elements?

  8. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability of the bar heights?

  9. Do you want the chart to have axis limits explicitly defined, or should they
  be auto-scaled based on the data?

  10. Is there a specific format for displaying the mean values (e.g., number of decimal
  places)?

  11. Would you like annotations or any additional notes on the chart for important
  insights or trends?'
