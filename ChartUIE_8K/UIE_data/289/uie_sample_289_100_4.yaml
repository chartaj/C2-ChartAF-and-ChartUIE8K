initial_prompt: 'Please create a line chart for cancer classification using the data
  provided in the format. I want lines representing the mean values of the following
  attributes over the sample data: mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, mean
  area, mean smoothness, and mean compactness. This will help visualize how each of
  these features varies across different samples. Make sure to clearly label the axes
  and provide a legend for each line to distinguish them. This chart will be used
  for a health-related analysis. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines?

  2. Would you like grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a specific title you would like to use for the chart?

  4. How would you prefer the legend to be positioned (e.g., right, bottom, top, left)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like to use for the labels and
  legend?

  6. Would you like data markers to indicate each data point on the lines?

  7. Should the lines be smooth or should they connect each data point with straight
  segments?

  8. Do you have a preferred style for the axes (e.g., color, thickness)?

  9. Is there any specific information you would like to include in the chart''s subtitle?'
