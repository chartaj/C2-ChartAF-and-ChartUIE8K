initial_prompt: I have data related to cancer classification, specifically with features
  like 'mean radius', 'mean texture', and more. I'd like a Beeswarm chart to visualize
  the distribution and differences of these features between benign (0) and malignant
  (1) cases. This will help to identify which features are most significant in differentiating
  between the two classes. Can you please create that Beeswarm chart for me, ensuring
  all key features are represented? Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different classes
  (benign and malignant)?

  2. Would you like a legend included in the chart to distinguish between benign and
  malignant cases?

  3. Do you prefer any specific ordering of the features on the Beeswarm chart?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  5. Would you like a title and labels for the axes? If so, do you have any specific
  titles or labels in mind?

  6. Do you want to display summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) on the Beeswarm
  chart?

  7. Is there a particular range or scale you prefer for any of the features on the
  axes?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like a legend included in the chart to distinguish between benign
  and malignant cases.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the ordering of the features.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, I would like a title and labels for the axes. Please use "Cancer Feature
  Distribution" for the title, "Features" for the x-axis, and "Value" for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.'
