initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showing sample data for "mean radius," "mean texture,"
  and "mean perimeter." Highlight differences in "benign_0__mal_1" classification.
  Annotate data points to emphasize "mean area" variations. Ensure readability and
  clarity for cancer classification analysis.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for highlighting differences in "benign_0__mal_1"
  classification?

  2. Do you have any preference for the bar orientation (horizontal or vertical)?

  3. How would you like the data points to be annotated for "mean area" variations
  (e.g., numeric value, percentage)?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for ensuring readability and clarity?

  5. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, please specify your
  preference.

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included for better data readability?

  7. Is there a preferred legend placement for the bar chart to enhance clarity? (e.g.,
  top, bottom, left, right)

  8. Do you require any additional elements (e.g., tooltips, reference lines) to be
  included in the chart for better analysis?

  9. Should the differences in "benign_0__mal_1" classification be represented using
  distinct shapes or patterns in addition to colors?

  10. Are there any particular software tools or libraries you would like the bar
  chart to be created with?'
