initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the cancer classification data where the
  x-axis represents 'mean radius' and the y-axis represents 'mean smoothness'. Annotate
  specific data points with their values and highlight malignant cases in red and
  benign cases in blue. This will help in visualizing the correlation between 'mean
  radius' and 'mean smoothness' for different cancer classifications. Focus on displaying
  both the distribution of points and the classification differences. Make sure to
  include a legend that identifies the benign and malignant cases.
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color shades of the data points
  for malignant and benign cases?

  2. How many data points would you like to annotate, and do you have specific criteria
  for selecting them?

  3. Do you prefer any particular style or format for data point annotations (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  4. Would you like to customize the title or labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  5. Are there any specific requirements for the legend''s placement or styling?

  6. Do you have a preferred range or scale for the x-axis and y-axis?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines or any background patterns?

  8. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size requirement for the scatter plot?

  9. Are there any additional elements or annotations you would like to include beyond
  the specified data points?

  10. Would you prefer to highlight any trends or lines of best fit in the scatter
  plot?'
