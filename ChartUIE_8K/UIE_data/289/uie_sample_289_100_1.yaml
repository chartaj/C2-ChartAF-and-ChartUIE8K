initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the classification of cases as either
  benign (0) or malignant (1) using the 'benign_0__mal_1' column data. Annotate specific
  data points, such as the mean radius, mean texture, and mean perimeter for each
  class. Highlight the column bars by altering the color based on the classification
  to make it visually clear. This will help in focusing on cancer diagnostic patterns,
  aiding in understanding the distribution and characteristics of the mean values
  for each class and identifying which features are prominent in malignant cases.
  This chart is essential for health data analysis and cancer research.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific preference for the color scheme to distinguish
  between benign and malignant cases?

  2. Would you like the bar chart to be oriented horizontally or vertically?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the font size or style for the annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a legend explaining the color scheme for the classifications?

  5. Are there any specific values or thresholds you''d like to highlight within the
  chart?

  6. Do you prefer a specific labeling style for the axes (e.g., scientific notation,
  decimal, percentage)?

  7. Is there a preferred title or subtitle you would like to include on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the background color or gridlines within the
  chart?

  9. Would you like to include error bars to indicate variability in the data, such
  as standard deviation?

  10. Should the chart include data labels directly on the bars showing the mean values?'
