initial_prompt: Create a dot plot visualizing the mean radius against the benign or
  malignant classification. Ensure each point is color-coded by classification for
  clarity.

  (benign and malignant)?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the dot plot for easier value reference?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the size of the dots in the plot?

  4. Should the axis labels include specific units or additional descriptive text?

  5. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If so, please provide the desired

  6. Do you want to include any specific annotations or data labels on the plot?

  7. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Would you prefer a specific order for the categories (benign/malignant) on the
  x-axis?

  9. Do you want the axis scales to be linear or logarithmic?

  10. Is there a specific range or limit you would like to set for the axes?'
