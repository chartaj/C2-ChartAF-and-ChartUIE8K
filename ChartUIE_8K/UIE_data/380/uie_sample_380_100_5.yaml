initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualizing the height distribution by country
  and gender. The data includes columns for Height (in float), Gender (Male/Female),
  and Country (United States, Canada, Mexico). I want to see how the height values
  are distributed across different genders and countries. No missing values are present
  in the dataset. Use distinct colors to differentiate between various heights, and
  ensure that the heatmap clearly shows the comparisons and patterns in height across
  the groups. The visualization should be easy to interpret and provide meaningful
  insights into height distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to be used in the
  heatmap?

  2. What range of height values would you like the heatmap to focus on, if any specific
  range is preferred?

  3. Is there a specific order in which you would like countries and genders to be
  displayed on the axis (e.g., alphabetical order or any other logical sequence)?

  4. Do you prefer to include labels or annotations on the heatmap cells to show the
  actual height values or percentages?

  5. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color scale used for different
  height values?

  6. Are there any specific gridlines or separators you prefer between different countries
  or gender categories?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or dimensions of the heatmap
  (e.g., square, rectangular)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Alphabetical order would be fine.

  4. Yes, please include labels on the heatmap cells to show the actual height values.

  5. Yes, include a legend explaining the color scale used for different height values.

  6. I do not have any specific preference.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
