initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map to visualize height distribution by country
  and gender. Use text annotations to highlight key statistics like average height.
  Employ highlights to distinguish between genders and different countries. The visualization
  should aid in understanding height variations across regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the choropleth map?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color scale and highlights?

  3. Should the text annotations for key statistics be displayed within the map or
  as a separate section?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for text annotations?

  5. Do you have any specific preferences for the geographic projection of the map?

  6. Would you like to include supplementary information, such as population size
  or density, in the map?

  7. Do you have any specific countries or regions that you want to be particularly
  emphasized?

  8. How would you prefer the height data to be categorized (e.g., specific height
  ranges or statistical quantiles)?

  9. Is there any specific software or tool you prefer for creating this choropleth
  map?

  10. Are there specific examples of choropleth maps you like that can guide the design
  of this visualization?'
