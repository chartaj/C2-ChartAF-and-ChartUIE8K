initial_prompt: Please create a histogram that visualizes the distribution of heights
  grouped by country and gender. The data includes height measurements, gender (Male
  or Female), and country (United States, Canada, United Kingdom). Ensure the histogram
  has separate bins for each gender within each country, showing the height distribution
  across these categories. Highlight the height variation and differences between
  genders for the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The x-axis should
  represent height ranges, while the y-axis should indicate the number of individuals
  within each range. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different genders and
  countries?

  2. What height range intervals (bin width) would you like to use on the x-axis?

  3. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes and legend?

  4. Should the histogram display counts or percentages on the y-axis?

  5. Do you prefer any specific layout for the grouping (e.g., side-by-side bars for
  genders within each country)?

  6. Are there any specific themes or styles you would like applied to the histogram
  (e.g., minimalist, detailed, professional)?'
