initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the height distribution by country,
  segmented by gender. The map should highlight differences in average height between
  the United States, and other countries. Use text annotations to mark key data points
  for each country, especially where significant height differences exist. The purpose
  of this visualization is to provide insights into health and nutritional factors
  across different populations. Highlights should distinguish between genders using
  different colors. This will make it easier to spot patterns and any anomalies. Make
  sure to include all given annotations for additional context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing between
  genders?

  2. Are there any specific countries, aside from the United States, that you would
  like to highlight?

  3. How detailed would you like the text annotations to be? For example, do you want
  the exact average heights or just indicators of significant differences?

  4. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Robinson,
  Winkel Tripel)?

  5. Are there any specific regions or countries you want to be more prominent or
  zoomed-in on the map?

  6. Would you like to include any additional contextual information or legends explaining
  the height ranges and color coding?

  7. Do you have preferences for the font style or size of the text annotations?

  8. Should the choropleth map include country borders or other geographical features
  for additional context?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Exact average heights would be preferred.

  6. Yes, include additional contextual information or legends explaining the height
  ranges and color coding.

  7. No specific preference.

  8. Yes, the choropleth map should include country borders or other geographical
  features for additional context.'
