initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the data from '472.csv'. The heatmap
  should show the change in data values between the years 2000 and 2020. Columns include
  'Country Name', the values for '2000' and '2020', and the 'group'. Highlight East
  Asia & Pacific countries. Emphasize differences between the two years with distinct
  color gradients. Ensure the heatmap is easy to interpret and visually appealing.

  for highlighting the differences between the years 2000 and 2020?

  specific color or shade?

  3. Should the heatmap show the exact data values within each cell or just the color
  intensity?

  by value difference)?

  heatmap?

  the heatmap to assist with interpretation?'
