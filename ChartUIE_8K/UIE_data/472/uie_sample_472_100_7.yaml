initial_prompt: Please create a slope chart using the data from the CSV file. The
  chart should show the change in values for each country between the years 2000 and
  2020. Include all the countries listed in the "Country Name" column, and use different
  colors to indicate the "group" each country belongs to. Make sure the x-axis represents
  the years 2000 and 2020, and the y-axis shows the values. Highlight any significant
  changes or trends observed from the data. This chart will be used for a government
  report, so accuracy and clarity are crucial.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used to indicate different
  ''groups'' each country belongs to?

  2. Should the countries with the most significant changes be highlighted in a particular
  way (e.g., different line thickness, labels)?

  3. Would you prefer the chart to include data labels showing the exact values for
  each country at both years (2000 and 2020)?

  4. Do you have any specific font or style preferences for the text and labels on
  the chart to ensure clarity?

  5. Is there a particular order in which you would like the countries to be displayed
  (e.g., by value magnitude, alphabetical order)?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart to improve readability, and if so, how
  prominent should they be?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or explanatory notes that you would like to
  include on the chart to enhance understanding?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart to fit within the
  government report?'
