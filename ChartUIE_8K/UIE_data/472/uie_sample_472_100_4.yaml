initial_prompt: Please create a Dumbbell chart that visualizes the change in values
  from the year 2000 to 2020 for different countries, grouped by their regions. The
  chart should clearly show the 2000 and 2020 values positioned at either end of the
  dumbbells, with countries on the y-axis and the years on the x-axis. Use different
  colors to highlight the grouping regions (East Asia & Pacific). This will help compare
  the growth or decline in values over 20 years for each country in distinct regional
  groups. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret for a government-focused audience.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting different regions?

  2. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact values for the years 2000
  and 2020?

  3. Do you want any specific annotations or highlights for particular countries or
  regions?

  4. Should the y-axis be sorted in a specific order, such as alphabetically or by
  the magnitude of change?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the style or thickness of the lines connecting
  the 2000 and 2020 values?

  6. Would you like to include any additional text or titles to provide context or
  explanations in the chart?

  7. Should the chart have a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be placed?

  8. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart''s text elements?

  9. Are there any specific design elements or aesthetics you want to include to ensure
  the chart is suitable for a government-focused audience?

  10. Would you like to include any background grid lines to make the chart easier
  to read?'
