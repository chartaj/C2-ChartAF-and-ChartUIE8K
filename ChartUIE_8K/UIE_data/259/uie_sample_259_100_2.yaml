initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing planetary mass (y-axis) against
  the orbital period in days (x-axis) from the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. Highlight
  planets discovered using the RV method and annotate points like 'HD 143761 b' and
  'KOI-1843.03' with their mass and period values. Make sure to use different colors
  for planets listed as 'Confirmed' and 'Controversial.' This chart will help focus
  on the relationship between mass and orbital period while identifying discovery
  methods and categorization.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific size or dimensions in mind for the scatter
  plot?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between ''Confirmed''
  and ''Controversial'' planets?

  3. How would you like the highlighted planets (discovered using the RV method) to
  be marked on the plot?

  4. Would you prefer annotations for the specific points to be in a particular format
  or style?

  5. Do you have any preferences for axis labels or title fonts and styles?

  6. Should the plot include a legend explaining the different colors and markers
  used?

  7. Do you prefer data points to be clustered in a certain way or spaced out evenly?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I''m not sure how exactly, maybe change their colors or use a different marker
  shape.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please include a legend explaining the different colors and markers used.

  7. I do not have a preference for how data points should be clustered or spaced.'
