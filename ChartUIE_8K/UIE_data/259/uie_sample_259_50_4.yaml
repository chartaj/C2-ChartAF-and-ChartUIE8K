initial_prompt: Create a histogram depicting the distribution of exoplanetary mass
  (PlanetaryMassJpt). Use bins to show the frequency of different mass ranges. Label
  the x-axis as "Planetary Mass (Jupiter Masses)" and the y-axis as "Frequency". Title
  the chart "Distribution of Exoplanetary Masses".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred number of bins for the histogram?

  2. Would you like to apply any specific binning techniques (e.g., equal-width bins,
  equal-frequency bins)?

  3. Do you have any preferences regarding the color of the bars in the histogram?

  4. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and title?

  6. Should the chart include any specific annotations or markers for significant
  mass ranges?

  7. Do you have any preferences on the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?

  8. Would you like to see any specific range of values highlighted on the x-axis
  or y-axis?

  9. Are there any specific styles or themes you prefer for the histogram (e.g., classic,
