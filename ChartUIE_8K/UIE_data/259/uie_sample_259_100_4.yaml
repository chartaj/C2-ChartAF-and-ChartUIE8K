initial_prompt: Create a histogram using the "Open Exoplanet Catalogue" dataset for
  the "DiscoveryYear" column. The histogram should show the frequency of discovered
  exoplanets per year. Use the year values on the x-axis and the number of exoplanets
  on the y-axis. This will help visualize the trend in exoplanet discoveries over
  time. Ensure the chart is clear, with labeled axes and a title reflecting its content,
  such as "Exoplanet Discoveries Per Year". Exclude any missing data in the "DiscoveryYear"
  column to keep the histogram accurate.
