initial_prompt: I want to create a Choropleth map using the given exoplanet data to
  visualize the distribution of discovered exoplanets based on their Right Ascension
  and Declination (coordinates). Each point should be color-coded depending on the
  discovery method (RV, transit, etc.). Additionally, include hover text showing the
  Planet Identifier, Discovery Year, and Discovery Method when I move the mouse over
  points. This will help in identifying any patterns regarding discovery techniques
  and their locations. Use a realistic and practical approach to represent the data
  from Open Exoplanet Catalogue accurately.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different discovery
  methods (RV, transit, etc.)?

  2. What geographical projections do you prefer for the Choropleth map, if any?

  3. Do you have a preferred range of years to focus on for the Discovery Year attribute?

  4. Would you like any specific visual markers or symbols for different discovery
  methods?

  5. Do you prefer a particular style or theme for the map (e.g., dark, light, satellite)?

  6. Are there any additional labels or legends you would like to include on the map?

  7. Would you prefer the size or shape of points to vary based on any specific data
  attribute?

  8. Are there any specific regions or coordinates you would like to highlight on
  the map?

  9. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the hover text?

  10. Would you like the map to provide any filters or categories for users to explore
  specific subsets of data?'
