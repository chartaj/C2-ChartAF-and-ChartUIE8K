initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of the 'RestaurantLessThan20'
  column from the in-vehicle coupon recommendation dataset. This data shows how often
  individuals frequent restaurants where the average meal price is less than $20.
  The histogram should highlight the different frequency ranges (e.g., 'never', 'less
  than once a month', '1-3 times a month', '4-8 times a month', 'more than 8 times
  a month'). This will help us understand the dining habits of passengers within this
  price range to better tailor our in-vehicle coupon offerings. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. Should the bars be labeled with the exact frequency counts?

  3. Do you want gridlines in the background of the histogram?

  4. Would you like to include a title or caption for the histogram? If so, what should
  it be?

  5. Is there a specific format for the axes labels you prefer (e.g. horizontal, angled)?

  6. Should there be any annotations or highlights on specific frequency ranges?

  7. Do you prefer the bars to have a specific width or spacing?

  8. Should the histogram have a legend, even if it only shows one data attribute?

  9. Do you want to include any additional textual information directly on the histogram?'
