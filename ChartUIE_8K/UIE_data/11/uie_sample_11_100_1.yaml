initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart visualizing the number of people
  who redeem in-vehicle coupons based on their destinations, categorized by gender.
  Use annotations to highlight key data points such as the most popular destination
  for coupon redemption. The chart should also indicate how factors like age and marital
  status influence redemption rates. This will help in understanding the behavioral
  patterns of automobile passengers regarding in-vehicle coupon usage. Highlight elements
  such as 'CoffeeHouse' and 'RestaurantLessThan20' to show variation in preferences.
  Include text annotations for any outliers or noteworthy trends.

  and outliers be positioned in a specific way?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for text annotations and labels?

  6. Should the x-axis display all categories of destinations even if they have zero

  the x-axis?

  8. Is there a preferred format for displaying the influenced factors like age and
  marital status (e.g., grouped, side-by-side)?
