initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap visualization for the in-vehicle coupon recommendation
  dataset. Highlight the correlation between variables like age, income, and coupon
  usage (Y). Use text annotations to indicate standout values, like high coupon uptake
  among certain age groups or income levels. Ensure to depict missing values distinctly
  and emphasize key relationships such as weather, education, and the likelihood of
  coupon redemption. The purpose is to help us understand patterns and target demographics
  for targeting in-vehicle coupon campaigns effectively, within the context of automobile
  usage and passenger behavior.

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the scale or range of the heatmap values?


  5. Would you like any specific labels or titles for the axes and legend?


  6. Are there any specific relationships or comparisons that you want to be especially
  emphasized?


  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering or clustering of the variables in the heatmap?


  8. Should any specific age or income brackets be used in the heatmap?


  9. Do you have any preferences for the size or dimensions of the heatmap?


  10. Would you prefer any other chart elements like grid lines, borders, or tooltips
  to be included or excluded?'
