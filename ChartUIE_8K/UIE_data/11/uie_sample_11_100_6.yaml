initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot for the "in-vehicle coupon recommendation"
  dataset. Plot "income" on the x-axis and "age" on the y-axis. Differentiate points
  by the "Y" column to show whether the coupon was accepted or not. Use different
  colors for accepted (Y=1) and not accepted (Y=0) coupons. Include labels and a legend
  to identify these groups.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors you prefer to use for the accepted
  and not accepted coupons?

  2. Do you prefer specific label names for the axes or should they be ''Income''
  and ''Age'' as per the data attributes?

  3. Is there a preferred format for the legend or should we use the default setting?

  4. Do you want to include gridlines in the scatter plot for better readability?

  5. Would you like a title for the scatter plot? If so, do you have any specific
  title in mind?

  6. Do you want to display data points with any specific markers or symbols for better
  differentiation?

  7. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?'
