initial_prompt: I'd like a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between 'Fresh'
  and 'Delicassen' purchases across different 'Regions' for wholesale customers. Please
  annotate specific data points to highlight significant outliers or unique trends.
  The purpose of this visualization is to understand how buying patterns between these
  two categories vary regionally, helping to identify potential market insights. Additionally,
  use different colors or sizes for the data points to distinguish between regions
  and make the chart more intuitive. The annotations should help focus on key insights
  without overwhelming the viewer.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for distinguishing between different
  regions?

  2. Would you like to use different shapes or sizes for the data points to represent
  regions, or just colors?

  3. How would you like the annotations to be displayed—next to data points, as tooltips,
  or at the bottom of the chart?

  4. Are there specific outliers or trends you already know of that should be annotated,
  or should they be determined based on the data analysis?

  5. Would you like trend lines or best-fit lines added to further illustrate the
  relationship between ''Fresh'' and ''Delicassen'' purchases?

  6. Do you have any preference for the axis scales—linear or logarithmic?

  7. Is there a specific title and axis label format you prefer for the scatter plot?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or explanatory note to help interpret the
  color or size variations?

  9. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the annotations
  and labels?

  10. Do you prefer data points with a higher opacity or a more transparent look to
  help visualize overlapping points?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe colors would be good.

  3. Next to the data points would be fine.

  4. I do not know specific outliers or trends.

  5. Yes, adding trend lines would be helpful.

  6. I prefer linear axis scales.

  7. I have no specific preference for titles or axis labels.

  8. Yes, please include a legend or explanatory note.

  9. I do not have any particular preference for fonts or font sizes.

  10. Higher opacity data points would be better.'
