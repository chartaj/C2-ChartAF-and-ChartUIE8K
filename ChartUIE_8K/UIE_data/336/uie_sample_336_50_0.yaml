initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlations among 'Fresh', 'Milk',
  'Grocery', 'Frozen', 'Detergents_Paper', and 'Delicassen'. Highlight areas with
  strong correlations. Use annotations to emphasize any significant correlations or
  interesting patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. What range of colors would you like to use for indicating different levels of
  correlation?

  3. Are there specific thresholds you want to use for differentiating strong, moderate,
  and weak correlations?

  4. How would you like significant correlations to be annotated (e.g., with correlation
  values, symbols, or text)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations?

  6. Should the heatmap include a color bar legend to interpret the correlation values?

  7. Are there any particular labels or titles you want to include for the heatmap
  and its axes?

  8. Would you like the correlation values to be displayed within the heatmap cells?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. With correlation values.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, include a color bar legend.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, display the correlation values within the heatmap cells.'
