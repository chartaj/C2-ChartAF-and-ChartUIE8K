09_answers: 'I am not sure about the color scheme for the regions.


  Please label the time by quarter.


  I do not know about the line style preference.


  I am not sure if the data points should be marked with symbols on the lines.


  I do not know about including gridlines in the chart.


  I would prefer the legend to be at the right.


  Yes, please include a title for the chart and axes. The title could be "Trends of
  Milk, Grocery, and Detergents_Paper Sales Over Time by Region." For the axes, "Time
  (quarters)" for the x-axis and "Sales" for the y-axis.


  I do not know if the chart should include any annotations or specific markers.


  I do not have a preference for the font style and size for labels and titles.'
