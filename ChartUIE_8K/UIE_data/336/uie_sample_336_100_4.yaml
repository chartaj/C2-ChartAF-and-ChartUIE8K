initial_prompt: I want a grouped bar chart that shows the comparison between different
  regions in terms of the average spending in categories like Fresh, Milk, Grocery,
  Frozen, Detergents_Paper, and Delicassen. Each group should represent one category,
  and within each group, I want bars for each region to see how spending patterns
  differ. This will help me analyze which regions spend more on specific items and
  identify trends or anomalies in the wholesale customers' purchasing behavior.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different regions?

  2. Do you want the average spending values to be displayed on the bars?

  3. Would you prefer the regions to be labeled on the x-axis or in a legend?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the categories or regions to be displayed?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use?

  7. Do you need grid lines to be shown on the chart?

  8. Should the y-axis be labeled with specific units (e.g., currency)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the bar spacing within each group?

  10. Is there any additional information or annotations that you would like to be
  included in the chart?'
