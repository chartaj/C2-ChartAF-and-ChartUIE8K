  This will help understand the distribution and variability in spending across different

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between
  "Channel" and "Region"?

  2. Would you like the box plots for "Milk" and "Grocery" to be displayed side by

  statistics) on the box chart?

  4. Should the chart have grid lines for easier reading, or do you prefer a cleaner
  look without them?

  5. Is there a specific order in which you would like the "Channel" or "Region" categories
