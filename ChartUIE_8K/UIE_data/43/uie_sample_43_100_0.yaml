initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the Blood Dataset focused on health
  data. Ensure the histogram highlights the distribution of 'Recency', 'Frequency',
  'Monetary', and 'Time' values. Use text annotations to highlight maximum, minimum,
  and average values for each attribute. Add visual highlights to the 'Class' variable
  to show how different classes are distributed across the dataset. This visualization
  aims to uncover patterns or outliers in the blood donation data, which can be useful
  for health insights and decision-making. Make it engaging and easy to interpret.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for highlighting different\
  \ 'Class' variables?\n2. Would you like any specific bins or ranges for the histogram\
  \ values?\n3. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal histograms for the data attributes?\n\
  4. For text annotations, do you have a preferred font size or style?\n5. Do you\
  \ want any specific color highlights for maximum, minimum, and average values?\n\
  6. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for displaying the values of maximum,\
  \ minimum, and average?\n7. Do you have a preference for the arrangement or layout\
  \ of the histograms for each attribute?\n8. Would you like grid lines to be included\
  \ in the histograms for better readability? \n9. Do you have any specific title\
  \ or labels in mind for the charts and axes?\n10. Are there any additional annotations\
  \ or markers you would like to include?"
