initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the Blood Dataset. Use text annotations
  for peak points to highlight values, and color highlights to distinguish between
  different classes. Focus on trends over time and emphasize the relation between
  Recency, Frequency, and Monetary elements.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting different
  classes?

  2. Would you like to have grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if
  so, in which style (solid, dotted, etc.)?

  3. What preferred styles or formats do you have for text annotations on peak points
  (e.g., font size, color, background)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed)
  representing ''Recency'', ''Frequency'', and ''Monetary'' elements?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Do you want to include legends, and if so, where would you prefer them to be
  placed (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like the Time axis to be formatted (e.g., in
  months, years)?

  8. Do you prefer any particular range for the axes, or should they be automatically
  scaled based on the data?

  9. Would you like to include any additional annotations or markers apart from the
  peak points and trend lines?'
