initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the blood donation data, focusing
  on Recency, Frequency, Monetary, Time, and Class. Label the columns and highlight
  key data points for clear comparison. Use text annotations to emphasize important
  values and trends, such as the highest frequency or monetary contributions over
  time. Ensure the Class variable is represented to distinguish categories. This chart
  will help health organizations analyze donation patterns and target specific donor
  segments effectively. Please make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret
  for better decision-making regarding blood donation strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like to use specific colors to represent different ''Class'' categories?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for annotations and labels?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate ''Recency'', ''Frequency'',
  ''Monetary'', and ''Time'', or do you have another preference?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, what style or density do you prefer
  for the gridlines?

  6. Do you have any preferences regarding the placement or orientation of text annotations
  (e.g., at the top of each bar, inside each segment)?

  7. Is there a specific way you want the x-axis and y-axis to be labeled?

  8. Would you like the chart to display average or median values for ''Recency'',
  ''Frequency'', ''Monetary'', and ''Time'', in addition to the individual data points?

  9. Do you prefer to have data points represented in a specific order (e.g., ascending
  or descending)?

  10. Any specific trend lines or markers you would like to add to emphasize important
  data points or trends?'
