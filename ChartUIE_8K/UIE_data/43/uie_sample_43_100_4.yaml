initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the Blood Dataset health data. Use
  the 'Class' column to represent the different classes on the x-axis. For each class,
  create bars for 'Recency', 'Frequency', 'Monetary', and 'Time' to show the average
  value of each metric. Ensure the y-axis reflects these values clearly. Add appropriate
  labels and a legend to distinguish the different metrics. This will help in comparing
  the characteristics of each class. This visualization aims to facilitate understanding
  of blood donation patterns and behaviors over time and by different user classes.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the bars representing
  ''Recency'', ''Frequency'', ''Monetary'', and ''Time''?

  2. Would you prefer a stacked bar chart or grouped bar chart to display the data?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Are there any specific axis label formats you would like (e.g., prefixing a unit,
  specific decimal places)?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison, and if so, in which
  style (dashed, solid)?

  6. Do you prefer the legend to be placed inside or outside the chart area?

  7. Are there any particular chart title or subtitle preferences that you have?

  8. Would you like to highlight any specific class or metric within the chart?

  9. Should the y-axis be set to start from zero, or should it be flexible based on
  the data range?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the chart area or the
  space around the chart?'
