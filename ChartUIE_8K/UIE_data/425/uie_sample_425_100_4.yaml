initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the annual revenue of the
  top media franchises. The x-axis should represent the year created, and the y-axis
  should display the revenue in billions. Each bar should be segmented by revenue
  category (e.g., Book sales, Box Office, Home Video/Entertainment). Use different
  colors for each revenue category to show their contributions to the total revenue.
  Include a legend to identify each revenue category. Also, make sure to highlight
  franchises with the highest total revenues for clear comparison. Title the chart
  "Annual Revenue Breakdown of Top Media Franchises."
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different revenue categories?\n\
  2. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability? \n3. Would you prefer\
  \ a specific font style or size for the chart title and labels?\n4. How would you\
  \ like the franchises with the highest total revenues to be highlighted (e.g., different\
  \ border color, bold labels)?\n5. Should the chart include data labels to show the\
  \ exact revenue values on each segment of the bars?\n6. Do you prefer the x-axis\
  \ labels to be displayed vertically, horizontally, or at an angle?\n7. Do you have\
  \ a specific order for displaying the revenue categories in the stacked bars?\n\
  8. Should the legend be placed in a specific location on the chart (e.g., right,\
  \ bottom, top)?"
