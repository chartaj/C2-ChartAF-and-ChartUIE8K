initial_prompt: Please create a line chart to visualize the annual revenue for each
  media franchise listed in the dataset. The x-axis should represent the years when
  the franchises were created, and the y-axis should show the revenue amounts. Each
  line should represent a different franchise to compare their revenue trends over
  time. Make sure to distinguish between different revenue categories like Book sales,
  Box Office, and Home Video/Entertainment. This will help in understanding how each
  franchise's revenue evolved and which revenue streams contributed the most.
