initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualizing the annual and total revenue
  of media franchises. The chart should have franchises on the x-axis and revenue
  in billions on the y-axis. Highlight the franchises with the highest revenues using
  different colors. Include text annotations to show revenue amounts above each bar,
  especially for the top three franchises. This will help in quickly identifying which
  franchises are the most financially successful. Make sure the chart is easy to read
  and visually appealing to ensure it captures the attention of the viewers effectively.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the franchises\
  \ with the highest revenues?\n2. Would you like the bars to be sorted in any particular\
  \ order (e.g., descending order of revenue)?\n3. Do you prefer any particular font\
  \ style or size for the text annotations above each bar?\n4. Are there any specific\
  \ dimensions or aspect ratios you would prefer for the chart?\n5. Do you have any\
  \ preferences for the background of the chart (e.g., a specific color or gradient)?\n\
  6. Would you like a legend included in the chart to explain the color coding?\n\
  7. Do you want gridlines to be present or absent in the chart?\n8. Are there any\
  \ specific labeling conventions you would like for the x-axis and y-axis?\n9. Do\
  \ you have a preference for the appearance of the bars (e.g., solid, gradient, or\
  \ patterned fill)? \n10. Would you like to include any additional annotations or\
  \ labels other than revenue amounts above each bar (e.g., year created or original\
  \ media)?"
