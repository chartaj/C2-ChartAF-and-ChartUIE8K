initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the annual and total revenue data
  for various media franchises. Plot each franchise's annual revenue on the Y-axis
  and the year created on the X-axis. Highlight franchises with the highest revenue
  to make them stand out. Add data-driven text annotations to highlight the highest-grossing
  franchises, focusing on those with unique media origins or notable creators. Use
  different colors or sizes for bubbles to represent different revenue categories,
  such as "Box Office," "Book Sales," and "Home Video." This will help compare the
  financial success of franchises over time and across different revenue streams.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred colors for different revenue categories?\n\
  2. Would you like specific shapes for bubbles representing different revenue categories,\
  \ or is size differentiation sufficient?\n3. Do you have a specific preference for\
  \ how the franchises with the highest revenue should be highlighted (e.g., color,\
  \ size, shape)?\n4. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the\
  \ annotations?\n5. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend on the\
  \ chart?\n6. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability, and if so,\
  \ in which style (e.g., dashed, solid)? \n7. Should the chart include a title and\
  \ axis labels, and do you have preferences for their text?"
