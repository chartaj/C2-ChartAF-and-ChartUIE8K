initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of slopes (Beginner,
  Intermediate, Difficult) across different resorts and countries in the European
  Ski Resorts dataset. Use text annotations to highlight the resorts with the highest
  total slopes and lift capacities, and distinguish these entries with a distinct
  color. The purpose is to help users quickly identify which resorts offer the most
  extensive skiing options and the best facilities. Additionally, use highlights to
  indicate resorts with snowparks and night skiing, emphasizing their recreational
  offerings.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How significant should the color differentiation be for resorts with the highest
  total slopes and lift capacities?

  3. What style and size of text annotations do you prefer for highlighting resorts?

  4. Would you like distinct markers or icons used for snowparks and night skiing
  highlights?

  5. Do you prefer the resorts to be sorted by country or by some other criteria on
  the heatmap?

  6. How detailed should the text annotations be for each resort?

  7. Is there a specific background or grid style you would like for the heatmap?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font type for the text annotations?

  9. Should the highlight colors for snowparks and night skiing be different from
  each other?

  10. Would you like to include any specific legends or labels on the heatmap?'
