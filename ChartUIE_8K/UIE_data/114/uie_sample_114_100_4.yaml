initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showing European Ski Resorts. Color-code countries
  based on the average DayPassPriceAdult. Use the provided data to highlight ski resorts
  in each country, indicating locations with markers or icons. Display tooltip information
  for each resort including Resort name, TotalSlope, Snowparks, NightSki options,
  and LiftCapacity. The map should give a quick visual cue of skiing costs across

  map interactive for user engagement.
