initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing GHG Emissions across different countries
  for Wheat & Rye (Bread). Use highlights for highest GHG values and annotations for
  specific elements to show exact emissions values. The chart should focus on environmental
  impact by countries and products.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the highlights and bars?

  2. What style of annotations do you prefer for displaying exact emission values?

  3. How would you like the highest GHG values to be visually distinguished? (e.g.,
  bold colors, different shading, special markers)

  4. Do you have a specific order preference for how countries should be displayed
  on the chart?

  5. Would you like to include any specific labels or legends on the chart?
