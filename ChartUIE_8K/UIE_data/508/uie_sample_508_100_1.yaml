initial_prompt: 'Create a matrix chart visualizing the environmental impact of different
  bread products using the given data columns. Highlight the columns: "Land Use (m2*year)",
  "GHG Emissions (kg CO2eq)", and "Water Use (L)". Annotate specific data points for
  "Wheat bread" in Australia and France to emphasize differences in environmental
  impact. Use color coding to distinguish between bread types and countries. Ensure
  the chart serves to compare the sustainability of bread production across regions.
  Provide textual annotations on highlighted cells to draw attention to key differences
  or insights in environmental metrics.'
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for different bread types and countries?

  2. Are there any specific color palettes you prefer for representing environmental
  metrics like ''Land Use'', ''GHG Emissions'', and ''Water Use''?

  3. Would you like the annotations to be displayed inside the chart or outside for
  better clarity?

  4. Do you have a specific preference for the font style and size for the annotations?

  5. Should the chart have gridlines for easier comparison between the regions and
  bread types?

  6. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the matrix (e.g., bread
  types on the x-axis, countries on the y-axis)?

  7. Is there a specific range or scaling you''d like to apply to the environmental
  metrics for better visualization?

  8. Would you like to include any legends or keys to explain the color coding and
  annotations used in the chart?

  9. Are there any additional metrics or columns you would like to include in the
  matrix chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific preference.

  3. Inside the chart.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines.

  6. Bread types on the x-axis, countries on the y-axis.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include legends or keys.

  9. No, just the highlighted columns I''ve mentioned.'
