initial_prompt: I want a bar chart that visualizes the environmental impact of different
  bread types across countries. Use "Product details" on the x-axis and "GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" on the y-axis. Highlight the bars for each
  country with different colors. Annotate bars with values for "Land Use (m2*year)"
  to show additional environmental impact. The chart should help in understanding
  how different bread production impacts the environment across various countries.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette to be used for different
  countries?

  2. Should the bars have any specific style or pattern to differentiate between bread
  types besides colors?

  3. Do you want the y-axis to start at zero, or should it be adjusted based on the
  data range?

  4. Do you have any preference on the font style and size for the annotations and
  labels?

  5. Would you like gridlines to be shown on the chart to aid in reading values, and
  if so, should they be major, minor, or both?

  6. Do you prefer any specific positioning or styling for the chart legend?

  7. Should there be any title or subtitle added to the chart? If so, what should
  it be?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the x-axis labels to ensure
  readability (e.g., slanted or horizontal)?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the chart margins or spacing between bars?

  10. Should the chart include any specific footnotes or sources of data?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, I would like gridlines to be shown. Both major and minor.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. Yes, the title should be "Environmental Impact of Bread Production Across Countries".
  No subtitle needed.

  8. I have no specific preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, please include the sources of data at the bottom of the chart.
