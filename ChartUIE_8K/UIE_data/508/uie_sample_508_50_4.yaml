initial_prompt: Create a histogram showing the frequency distribution of "GHG Emissions
  (kg CO2eq, IPCC2013 incl CC feedbacks)" for different "Product id" categories. Highlight
  specifically the ranges and frequency of emissions to see which products have higher
  environmental impact.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the histogram, especially for
  highlighting specific ranges of emissions?

  2. Do you have a preferred number of bins for categorizing the frequency distribution?

  3. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations within the histogram
  to emphasize particular data points?

  4. Are there any particular categories of "Product id" you would like to focus on
  or separate from others in the visualization?

  5. Do you prefer a specific layout or aspect ratio for the histogram (e.g., horizontal
  vs. vertical orientation)?

  6. Should any additional summary statistics (mean, median, etc.) be displayed on
  the histogram?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you would like used for the text in the
  visualization?

  8. Do you want a legend included, and if so, how would you like it to be displayed?

  9. Is there any specific title or subtitle you would like for the histogram?

  10. Would you prefer gridlines or other background elements to be included or left
  out of the chart?'
