initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of "Country" for
  the product type "Wheat & Rye (Bread)" in the "jp_lca_dat" dataset within the "food-and-drink"
  category. Use the "Country" column to segment the pie chart and represent the proportions
  of each country where "Wheat & Rye (Bread)" products are sourced. The pie chart
  should accurately reflect the relative frequency of occurrences of each country
  in the dataset. Label each segment with the respective country's name and its percentage
  share of the total. The chart should be legible and clearly labeled.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the pie chart segments?

  2. How would you like the country labels to be positioned (inside the segments or
  outside with leader lines)?

  3. Would you like to include a legend in the pie chart? If so, where should it be
  placed?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and percentages?

  5. Should the chart include any specific title or subtitle?

  6. Do you have a preferred angle for where the first segment starts (e.g., top,
  right)?

  7. Would you like the percentages to be shown as whole numbers or to include decimal
  places?

  8. Is there a specific slice ordering preference (e.g., largest to smallest, alphabetical)?

  9. Do you want to apply any particular data transformation or filtering, such as
  excluding countries with very low percentages from the chart?

  10. Should the background of the chart be a specific color or pattern?'
