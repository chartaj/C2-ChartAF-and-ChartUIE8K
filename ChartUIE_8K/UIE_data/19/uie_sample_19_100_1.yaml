initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the User Ratings of Amazonâ€™s Top 50
  Bestselling Books from 2009 to 2019, separating Fiction and Non Fiction genres.
  Highlight books with exceptionally high or low ratings and add text annotations
  for any outliers to provide context. This will help identify trends in user preferences
  over the years. Ensure the chart distinctly categorizes each year to show changes
  in rating distribution over time. Also, use different colors to differentiate between
  Fiction and Non Fiction genres for better visual clarity.
