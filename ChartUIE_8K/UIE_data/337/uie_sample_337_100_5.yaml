initial_prompt: Please create a Choropleth map to visualize the distribution of our
  customers across the United States. Use the "State" and "Sales" columns from the
  data provided to represent the total sales in each state. This map will help us
  identify the states with the highest and lowest sales, enabling us to optimize our
  supply chain management for car sales in different regions. Attach the map to the
  report, including a color legend to represent sales magnitude accurately. Additionally,
  ensure the tooltips show state names and corresponding sales figures for user interaction.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the color legend depicting sales
  magnitude?

  2. Would you like specific color ranges such as blue to red, green to yellow, etc.?

  3. Should the color gradient be linear or logarithmic?

  4. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the map (e.g., minimalistic,
  vibrant, professional)?

  5. Should the map include state borders or other geographical details?

  6. Are there any specific labels or additional information you would like to see
  apart from state names and sales figures in the tooltips?

  7. Do you have any preferences regarding the font type or size for the map and legend
  labels?

  8. Would you like the sales data to be displayed in absolute numbers or as percentages
  of total sales?'
