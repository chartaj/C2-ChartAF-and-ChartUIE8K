initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the supply chain management for car
  makers by plotting the CarPrice over OrderDate. Use different colored lines for
  various CarMakers and CarModels to distinguish them. Include annotations such as
  trend lines for each CarMaker, highlight significant price changes, and use shapes
  to enclose outlier data points. Make sure to emphasize the CarPrice fluctuation
  trends for better insights into pricing strategies over time. The chart should help
  in understanding the market trends and customer preferences based on the supplied
  data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to distinguish different
  CarMakers and CarModels?

  2. What kind of trend lines would you prefer for each CarMaker (e.g., linear, moving
  average, polynomial)?

  3. How would you like significant price changes to be highlighted (e.g., with specific
  symbols, different colors, or annotations)?

  4. Do you have any specific symbols or shapes you would like to use to enclose the
  outlier data points?

  5. Would you like to add any labels or titles to the axes? If so, what should they
  be?

  6. Is there any specific date range you would like to focus on within the OrderDate
  data?

  7. Are there any additional annotations or specific data points you would like highlighted
  for better insights?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, but something visually distinct for each CarMaker and
  CarModel would be good.

  2. Linear trend lines for each CarMaker, please.

  3. Different colors for significant price changes.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, "Order Date" for the x-axis and "Car Price" for the y-axis.

  6. I am not sure, maybe the entire date range available.

  7. No, I have no specific preference.'
