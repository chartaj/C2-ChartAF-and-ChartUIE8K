initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total sales of different
  car makers over various years. Each car maker should be a distinct color within
  the stack, and the years should be on the x-axis. Highlight car makers that have
  significantly higher sales with brighter colors. Use annotations like arrows or
  rectangles to spotlight major trends, such as peaks or drops in sales for specific
  car makers. Place the car price on the y-axis and separate bars for each year. This
  visualization should help compare how different car makers perform over time in
  sales.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the distinct colors representing
  each car maker?

  2. How would you like the brighter colors to distinguish car makers with significantly

  or drops during particular years?

  4. Would you like any specific styling or placement for the annotations (arrows
  or rectangles)?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the car makers to be displayed within the
  stacks?

  6. Do you want any particular labels or legends to be highlighted?

  7. Is there a preferred font or style for the text in the annotation and axis labels?

  8. Would you like gridlines or background shading to be included in the chart for
  better readability?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Focus on peaks and significant drops in sales during specific years.

  4. Arrows pointing at peaks, and rectangles around significant drops would work.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Please highlight the legends for clarity.

  7. I do not have a preferred font or style.

  8. Gridlines might help with readability.'
