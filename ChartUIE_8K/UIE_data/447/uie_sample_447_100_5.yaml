initial_prompt: I have a dataset that compares the millions of dollars earned by women
  and men in a business context. The dataset has no missing values and contains multiple
  unique entries for both categories. I would like to create a stacked column chart
  to visualize the data. The chart should have two columns for each category, with
  one showing the earnings of women and the other showing the earnings of men. The
  x-axis should represent different years or segments, while the y-axis should represent
  the amount in millions of dollars.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the columns representing women''s
  and men''s earnings?

  2. Would you like to include labels or annotations showing exact values on the columns?

  3. How would you like the years or segments to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g.,
  tilted, rotated, or horizontal)?

  4. Is there a specific range or scale you want to use for the y-axis?

  5. Would you like a legend to indicate which columns represent women’s and men’s
  earnings?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the font style or size for the axis labels
  and chart title?

  7. Would you like to include a grid for the y-axis to enhance readability?'
