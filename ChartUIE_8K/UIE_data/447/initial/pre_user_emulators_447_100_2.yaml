2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing "Woman's millions of dollars" versus "Men's millions
  of dollars" from the dataset. Emphasize the top three data points with text annotations
  displaying their values. Use different colors to highlight the positions of women's
  and men's salaries on the scatter plot. The purpose is to clearly compare the salary
  distribution between genders in a business context, focusing on significant outliers.
  This visualization will help in highlighting salary disparities and provides a visual
  context for understanding gender pay gaps within the dataset.
