initial_prompt: Please create a bubble chart to visualize the ECG of Cardiac Ailments
  Dataset. Use "RRmean" for the x-axis, "PPmean" for the y-axis, and "SDRR" for the
  bubble size. Differentiate the bubbles by the "ECG_signal" category to show variations
  between different cardiac conditions. Make sure to label the axes and include a
  legend to indicate what each bubble color represents. This will help in understanding
  the relationship between these measurements and how they vary with different ECG
  signals.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  "ECG_signal" categories?

  2. What specific title would you like to use for this bubble chart?

  3. Would you prefer any specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range or scale (linear or logarithmic) for the
  x-axis (RRmean)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the range or scale (linear or logarithmic) for the
  y-axis (PPmean)?

  6. Should there be any specific annotations or markers on certain data points that
  are of particular interest?

  7. Do you have a preference for the transparency level of the bubbles?

  8. Would you like gridlines to be displayed on the chart, and if so, in what style?

  9. Are there any specific guidelines or standards we should follow due to the medical
  nature of the data?

  10. Should there be any margin or padding specifications around the chart area?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. "ECG Cardiac Conditions: RRmean vs PPmean"

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Linear scale is fine.

  5. Linear scale is fine.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, I would like gridlines, but I do not have a specific style in mind.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not know.'
