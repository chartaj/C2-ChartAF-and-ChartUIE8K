initial_prompt: I want an area chart that visualizes the heartbeats per minute (hbpermin)
  over time for the ECG of Cardiac Ailments dataset. The x-axis should represent the
  RECORD number, and the y-axis should represent the hbpermin. It should show the
  variations in heartbeats over different records. The area under the curve should
  be shaded to make it visually appealing. Ensure to label the axes and provide a
  legend if necessary. Use different colors if there are multiple conditions like
  'ARR' in the ECG_signal. Please make it interactive for detailed analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different conditions
  in the ECG_signal?

  2. Is there a specific style you prefer for the area shading (solid, gradient)?

  3. Do you have preferences for the labels on the axes (font size, style)?

  4. Would you like to see any additional annotations or markers on the chart, such
  as maximum and minimum values?

  5. Are there any specific gridline preferences (e.g., color, thickness) for the
  chart?

  6. Would you prefer a specific legend placement (top, bottom, side) on the chart?

  7. Do you have any specific title or subtitle you''d like to include on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific aspects of the data you want emphasized, such as certain
  ranges or thresholds?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a gradient?

  3. I do not have specific preferences.

  4. Yes, I would like to see maximum and minimum values annotated.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not have a preference for legend placement.

  7. I have no specific title or subtitle in mind.

  8. Emphasize any significant variations or patterns, such as sharply increasing
  or decreasing heartbeats.'
