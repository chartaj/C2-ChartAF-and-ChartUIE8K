initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the "ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset".
  The chart should plot the 'RECORD' on the x-axis to represent the record number,
  and 'hbpermin' on the y-axis for the heartbeat per minute. Additionally, plot 'QTseg'
  and 'STseg' on the second y-axis to show the QT and ST segments over the same 'RECORD'
  values. Include a legend to differentiate the three lines. This will help in analyzing
  the heartbeat variations and ECG segment durations together over different records.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the three lines representing
  ''hbpermin'', ''QTseg'', and ''STseg''?

  2. Would you like to set specific ranges for either of the y-axes?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)
  for each data attribute?

  4. Is there a particular title you would like for the chart?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font styles and sizes for the title and legends?

  6. Should gridlines be included in the chart, and if so, do you have a preference
  for their style and color?

  7. Would you like to annotate any specific points or patterns in the data? If so,
  please specify.

  8. Are there any specific labels or notes you want to include on the axes?'
