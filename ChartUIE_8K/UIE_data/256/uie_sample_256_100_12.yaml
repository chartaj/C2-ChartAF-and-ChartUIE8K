initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart visualizing the mean values of selected
  ECG measurements like 'hbpermin', 'QRSseg', 'QTseg', and 'RRmean' for the first
  few records. Separate bars should represent the measurements, and different stacks
  within each bar should represent different records. Include labels for each segment
  and a legend. Title it "Mean ECG Segments Comparison". Ensure each bar segment has
  a distinct color. This visualization will help compare the ECG metrics across different
  patients. Analyze any visible trends or outliers. Please make the chart concise
  and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the distinct segments
  in the stacked column chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  4. Should the chart include data labels for each segment showing the mean values?

  5. How many records do you want to include in the visualization (e.g., first 5,
  first 10)?

  6. Do you have a preference on the order of the records displayed in the stacks
  (e.g., ascending or descending)?

  7. Would you like to customize the y-axis range or leave it to be determined automatically
  based on the data?

  8. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size you prefer for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  2. Yes, I would like the chart to have gridlines for better readability.

  3. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  4. Yes, the chart should include data labels for each segment showing the mean values.

  5. Please include the first 5 records in the visualization.

  6. I do not have a preference on the order of the records displayed in the stacks.

  7. Leave the y-axis range to be determined automatically based on the data.

  8. I do not have a specific aspect ratio or size preference for the chart.'
