initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the proportion of different ECG signals
  in the dataset. Highlight key segments and use text annotations to indicate the
  percentage and type of each signal (ARR). This helps understand the distribution
  of ECG patterns related to cardiac ailments. Make the chart clear and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different segments
  of the pie chart?

  2. How would you like the key segments to be highlighted (e.g., different shades,
  borders, or increased size)?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations indicating
  the percentages and types of each signal?

  4. Would you like the pie chart to include a legend, or should all the information
  be contained within the text annotations?

  5. Should the chart include a title, and if so, do you have any specific wording
  in mind for it?

  6. Is there a particular placement preference for the text annotations on the pie
  chart (e.g., inside the segments, outside, or a combination)?

  7. Are there any specific labels or descriptions you would like to accompany the
  chart to further explain the data?

  8. Would you like to see the raw percentage values or rounded figures for clarity
  in the text annotations?

  9. Do you prefer any specific layout for the chart (e.g., compact, spacious) in
  terms of spacing and arrangement of elements?

  10. Should there be any emphasis or special styling for the largest or most significant
  segments in the chart?'

  5. Yes, include a title. "Distribution of ECG Patterns Related to Cardiac Ailments"

  6. Inside the segments.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Rounded figures for clarity.

  9. I am not sure.
