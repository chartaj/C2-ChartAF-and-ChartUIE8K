initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the average heart rate per
  minute (hbpermin) from the ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset. Highlight the mean for
  better comparison. Add text annotations for minimum and maximum values to draw attention
  to these specific data points. This visualization aims to quickly convey the heart
  rate distribution among the patients and identify outliers. The focus is on the
  mean heart rate to assess overall cardiac health trends within the dataset. Additionally,
  use colors to differentiate between the highlighted points and the rest of the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the mean and
  the extreme values (minimum and maximum) on the chart?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for the rest of the data bars in the
  column chart?

  3. How would you like the mean heart rate to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  dashed line, etc.)?

  4. What font style and size would you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart? If so, how should they be
  styled?

  6. Should the chart have a title, and if yes, what should it be?

  7. Do you want axis labels, and if so, how would you like them to be labeled?

  8. Do you prefer any specific layout for the legend, if needed?

  9. Would you like to include any additional descriptive text or notes on the chart?
  If yes, please specify.'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Different color for the mean heart rate.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, the title should be "Average Heart Rate Per Minute (hbpermin) Distribution".

  7. Yes, the X-axis labeled as "Patient ID" and the Y-axis labeled as "Heart Rate
  (hbpermin)".

  8. I do not know.

  9. No specific additional descriptive text or notes.'
