initial_prompt: Create a dot plot using the ECG of Cardiac Ailments Dataset. Visualize
  "hbpermin" and "RRmean" on the x-axis and y-axis, respectively, with one dot per
  record. Differentiate points by "ECG_signal" type. Include a legend and axis labels
  detailing the heart rate in beats per minute and the mean RR interval duration.
  Highlight any missing data points with a distinct color or marker.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for different ECG_signal types?

  2. How would you like the missing data points to be highlighted (color or specific
  marker)?

  3. Do you prefer the x-axis and y-axis to have a specific range or should they automatically
  adjust based on the data?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines? If yes, do you have a preference for their
  style or color?

  6. Do you require any specific annotations or markers on certain data points?

  7. Would you like the dots to have varying sizes based on another attribute, or
  should they all be the same size?

  8. Is there a particular title you would prefer for the chart?

  9. Do you have any preference for the overall aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  chart?'
