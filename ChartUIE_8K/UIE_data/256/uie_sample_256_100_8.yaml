initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of heartbeats
  per minute observed in the ECG of Cardiac Ailments dataset. The x-axis should represent
  the heartbeat range, and the y-axis should represent the frequency of records falling
  within each heartbeat range. Highlight any noticeable trends or outliers. Ensure
  the histogram is well-labeled and easy to interpret. Use appropriate bin sizes for
  a clear visualization of the data variation. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for the bars in the histogram?

  2. Would you like specific colors or styles to highlight trends and outliers?

  3. Do you have a preferred number of bins or bin size for the histogram?

  4. Are there any specific x-axis or y-axis limits you want to set?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?

  6. Would you like to include a legend or annotations in the histogram?

  7. Do you have any preference for the labeling format on the x-axis (e.g., specific
  range intervals)?

  8. Should the histogram include grid lines or a specific background style for better
  interpretability?'
