initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to ECG of Cardiac Ailments. Could you please
  create a grouped bar chart showcasing the average values of `hbpermin`, `QTseg`,
  `RRmean`, `PPmean`, `PQdis`, and `PTdis` for the first 10 records? Use different
  colors for each category to distinguish them clearly. This will help us visualize
  the distribution and comparison of these critical ECG measurements across a small
  sample. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different categories?

  2. Would you prefer to have gridlines in the background for better readability?

  3. Do you need axis labels to be rotated for better visibility, especially if they
  are long?

  4. Should the chart include a title and subtitle for better context?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to clarify the different categories?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size that you prefer for the chart labels
  and title?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the categories or the data points?'
