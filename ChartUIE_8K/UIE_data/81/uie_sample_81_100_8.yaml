initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between subscriber
  numbers and video views for YouTube channels in the Global YouTube Statistics 2023
  data. Label the x-axis as 'Subscribers' and the y-axis as 'Video Views'. Use different
  colors to differentiate the 'category' of YouTube channels (e.g., Music, Film &
  Animation, Entertainment). Include data points for 'MrBeast', 'T-Series', and 'YouTube
  Movies'. Ensure that the plot includes a legend, and set an appropriate title such
  as "Subscribers vs Video Views by Category". Include trend lines for each category
  if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the categories
  of YouTube channels?

  2. What specific markers or symbols would you like to use for the data points representing
  ''MrBeast'', ''T-Series'', and ''YouTube Movies''?

  3. How detailed would you like the legend to be? Should it include sample data points
  or just category names?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style or type of trend lines (e.g., linear,
  polynomial) for each category?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels, title,
  and legend?

  6. Would you like the background of the scatter plot to be white, or do you prefer
  a different background color?

  7. Do you want grid lines on the plot? If so, how would you like them to be styled
  (e.g., dotted, solid)?

  8. Would you like the chart to have any specific annotations or highlights for outliers
  or significant data points?

  9. Do you have a preferred format or style for displaying the axis tick labels (e.g.,
  scientific notation, commas for thousands)?

  10. Any specific requirements for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?
