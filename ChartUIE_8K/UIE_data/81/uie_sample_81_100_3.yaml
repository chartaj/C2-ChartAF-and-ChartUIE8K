initial_prompt: 'I need a grouped column chart visualizing the top 3 YouTubers by
  ''subscribers'' and ''video views''. Highlight ''subscribers'', ''video views'',
  and ''video_views_for_the_last_30_days'' for each Youtuber. Include data from ''category''
  and ''Country'' to differentiate groups. Title the chart "Top YouTubers Statistics
  2023". Use different colors for each Youtuber and respective metrics for clarity.
  Ensure all labels are clear for easy understanding. Include a legend and axis titles
  for completeness. Reference: Global YouTube Statistics 2023 and ../Extra_datas/data/81.csv.'
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating between YouTubers
  and metrics?

  2. Do you have any specific font preferences for the labels and titles?

  3. How would you like the Youtubers to be ordered in the grouped column chart?

  4. Are there any particular styles or themes you would like the chart to have?

  5. Do you prefer particular shapes or styles for the data markers/columns?

  6. Would you like the data values to be displayed on top of the columns?

  7. Do you have specific preferences for the axis gridlines (e.g. no gridlines, light
  gridlines)?

  8. How detailed should the legend be? Should it include individual metrics or just
  Youtuber names?

  9. Do you prefer to highlight any specific data points differently?

  10. Should we use any annotations or call-out boxes to provide additional context
  for certain values?

  11. Would you prefer a specific design for the axis labels or titles, such as bold
  or italic text?'
