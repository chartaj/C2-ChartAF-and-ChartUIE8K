initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the top 10 YouTube channels by
  number of subscribers. Each column should represent a YouTube channel, with the
  height indicating the number of subscribers. Additionally, color-code the columns
  by category for better differentiation. X-axis labels will be the channel names,
