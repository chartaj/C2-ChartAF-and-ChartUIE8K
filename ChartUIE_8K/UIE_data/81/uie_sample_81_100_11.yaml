initial_prompt: I have data on the top YouTubers globally in 2023 and some country
  statistics. I'd like to create a dot plot visualizing the relationship between YouTuber's
  subscribers and their video views. For the Y-axis, please plot 'subscribers' and
  for the X-axis, use 'video views'. Also, differentiate the dots by 'category', and
  use different colors for each country (based on 'Country' data). Include axis titles
  and a legend for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the countries?

  2. Would you like the categories to be represented by specific shapes or just standard
  dots?

  3. What title would you like for the chart?

  4. Should there be specific labels or annotations for any of the data points?

  5. Do you prefer a specific style for the legend (e.g., positioned at the top, right,
  left, bottom)?

  6. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the axes (X and Y)?

  7. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the axis titles and
  legend?

  9. Should outliers be highlighted in a specific way?

  10. Would you like to display data tooltips when hovering over the data points?'
