initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the global YouTube statistics from 2023,
  focusing on subscribers, video views, and country data. Highlight top YouTubers
  like T-Series, YouTube Movies, and MrBeast to emphasize their dominance. Use annotations
  to display specific figures such as subscriber count and total video views. The
  heatmap should show various metrics like earnings and rankings across different
  countries. Add contextual annotations to explain trends and notable differences
  between categories. This visualization will help in understanding the distribution
  and comparison of YouTube channels on a global scale. Use a color gradient to represent
  different levels of data density effectively.
