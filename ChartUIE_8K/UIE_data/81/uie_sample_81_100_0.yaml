initial_prompt: Visualize the Global YouTube Statistics 2023 with a geographic heatmap
  highlighting YouTube channels' popularity worldwide. Use the country-wise distribution
  of data such as subscribers, video views, and urban population. Provide text annotations
  for top-performing channels in each region to highlight key metrics like subscribers
  and video views. Apply highlights on countries with extreme values to emphasize
  outliers. This allows for an intuitive geographic comparison of YouTube presence
  and influencers' impact globally. This chart can aid in understanding YouTube's
  regional dominance and the correlation with urban population and other socio-economic
  factors.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?\n2. Would you\
  \ like to include a legend to explain the color gradients?\n3. Do you prefer a specific\
  \ style for text annotations (e.g., font size, color)?\n4. Should the annotations\
  \ be placed inside or outside the geographic regions on the map?\n5. Is there a\
  \ preference for how outliers should be highlighted (e.g., outline, different color)?\n\
  6. Would you like to see any additional metrics or data points displayed on the\
  \ map?\n7. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for the map (e.g.,\
  \ Mercator, Robinson)?\n8. Do you have any constraints on the size or aspect ratio\
  \ of the map?\n9. Should the map include country names or abbreviations by default?\
  \ \n10. Are there any specific regions or countries you would like to focus on or\
  \ highlight more prominently?"
