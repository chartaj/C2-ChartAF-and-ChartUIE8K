initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the "Wavelength" over "p position"
  for the "Lyman Series" in the dataset. Highlight key data points and add annotations
  for specific values to enhance clarity.
questions: '1. Do you prefer any specific color schemes for highlighting the key data
  points?

  2. Are there any particular values or thresholds you would like annotated on the
  chart?

  3. Do you have a preference for the style of line (e.g., solid, dashed) used in
  the chart?

  4. Should the annotations include additional information like units (e.g., ''nm''
  for Wavelength)?

  5. Do you want gridlines to be present on the chart? If so, should they be major,
  minor, or both?

  6. Would you prefer the data points to be marked with shapes (e.g., circles, squares)
  or just highlighted in a different color?

  7. Do you require a legend or key to explain the annotations and highlighted points?

  8. Should the axes include descriptive labels (e.g., ''Wavelength (nm)'') and if
  so, how detailed should they be?

  9. Is there a preferred position for the annotations (e.g., above the point, beside
  the point)?

  10. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, do you have any specific
  title in mind?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please annotate the key points where significant changes occur in the wavelengths.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, please include units like ''nm'' for Wavelength.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Highlight the data points in a different color.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include descriptive labels like ''Wavelength (nm)'' and ''p position''.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, title it ''Wavelength vs. p Position for the Lyman Series''.'
