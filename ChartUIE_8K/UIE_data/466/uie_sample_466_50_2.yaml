initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing the 'Series' and 'Wavelength' data. Use
  text annotations to highlight unique 'l position' and 'p position' values, emphasizing
  differences. The goal is to illustrate spectral lines' distribution in physics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the treemap?

  2. Should the treemap include a specific layout or arrangement style?

  3. Would you like the size of the rectangles in the treemap to represent the frequency
  of ''Series'' or another data attribute?

  4. Do you have any specific font preferences or sizes for the text annotations?

  5. Should the text annotations for ''l position'' and ''p position'' be positioned
  in a particular way on the treemap?

  6. Would you like to include any legends or keys to help explain the categories
  within the treemap?

  7. Do you have a preference for the overall dimensions or aspect ratio of the treemap?

  8. Should there be any specific labeling or titling conventions used for the treemap?
