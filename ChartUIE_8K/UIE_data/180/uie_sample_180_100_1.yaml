initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap illustrating the distribution of the top
  5000 albums based on artist origins. Highlight regions with high concentrations
  of top-rated albums. Use annotations to provide details about notable albums, such
  as their ranking, artist names, and average ratings. The purpose is to visualize
  the global impact of music across different genres and periods. This will help in
  understanding how certain regions contribute to the music scene and highlight influential
  albums.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the geographic heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to show the scale of album concentrations?

  3. How would you like the regions with high concentrations of top-rated albums to
  be highlighted (e.g., brighter colors, larger markers)?

  4. Do you have a preference for the type of annotations used to provide details
  about notable albums (e.g., tooltips, labels)?

  5. Should the annotations include more information beyond ranking, artist names,
  and average ratings, such as release dates or genres?

  6. Would you prefer to see the map focused on specific regions or displayed globally?

  7. Are there any specific geographic regions or countries you want to emphasize
  more in the heatmap?'
