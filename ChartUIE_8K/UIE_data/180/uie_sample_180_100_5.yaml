initial_prompt: I have a dataset of the top 5000 albums of all time. I want to visualize
  the correlation between the genres and descriptors present in these albums. Can
  you please create a heatmap for me? It should show how frequently different genres
  and descriptors occur together in the dataset. For instance, how often "Progressive
  Rock" and "melancholic" appear together, compared to other genre-descriptor pairs.
  This will help me understand the common characteristics and overlaps in music styles
  and themes. Ensure that the heatmap is clear and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the genre and descriptor names to be displayed on the axes clearly
  and in full form?

  3. Should certain genre-descriptor pairs be highlighted or emphasized?

  4. Do you have a preferred level of granularity for the frequency count (e.g., whole
  numbers, percentages)?

  5. Would you like a legend or key to explain the color intensity on the heatmap?

  6. Is there a particular format or styling you prefer for the text labels on the
  axes?

  7. Should the heatmap include any annotations or additional information on hover?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?'
