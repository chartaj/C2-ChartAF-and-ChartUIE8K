initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart that visualizes the Top 5000 Albums
  of All Time dataset. The chart should break down the genres of the top 10 albums
  and their average ratings. Annotate the chart to highlight the top 3 rated albums
  and mention their average ratings. Use different colors for each genre to make it
  visually attractive and clear. The purpose is to quickly understand the genre distribution
  among highly-rated albums. Include textual annotations to provide insights about
  the top-rated albums and their distinctive genres.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the genres?

  2. How do you want the top 3 rated albums to be annotated (e.g., circles, arrows)?

  3. Would you prefer the average ratings to be shown as data labels on the columns
  or in a separate legend?

  4. Do you have any preference for the order of genres in the stacked columns?

  5. Is there a specific style or font you prefer for the textual annotations?

  6. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have any specific
  text in mind for these elements?

  7. Do you want the chart to include gridlines or any specific background color?

  8. How detailed do you want the legends to be? Should they include both genre and
  average rating information?

  9. Do you have preferences for the spacing between columns and the width of columns
  in the chart?

  10. Should the genres be categorized in any specific way (e.g., primary and secondary
  genres) in the chart?'

  2. I am not sure, maybe arrows or circles could work?

  Genre Distribution with Average Ratings," and the axis labels could be "Albums"
  and "Average Ratings."

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.
