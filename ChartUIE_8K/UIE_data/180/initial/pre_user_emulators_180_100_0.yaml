2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing the "Average Rating" vs. "Number of Ratings" for
  the Top 5000 Albums of All Time. Use text annotations to label data points for albums
  with the highest and lowest ratings. Highlight the top 10 albums with a distinctive
  color to emphasize their importance. The purpose is to quickly understand the distribution
  of album ratings and identify standout records. The data context is music, aiming
  to provide insights into which albums are highly rated versus frequently rated by
  listeners. Ensure the visualization is clear and informative.
