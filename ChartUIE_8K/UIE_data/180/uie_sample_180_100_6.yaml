initial_prompt: I need a bar chart showing the "Average Rating" for the top 10 albums
  from the "Top 5000 Albums of All Time" dataset. The x-axis should display the album
  names, and the y-axis should represent their average ratings. Use different colors
  for each bar to make it visually appealing. Also, include the artist's name under
  each album name on the x-axis. This chart will help me quickly identify which albums
  have the highest average ratings among the top 10. Please ensure the chart is clear
  and easy to read.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred font type or size for the text on the chart?\n\
  2. Would you like gridlines to be included on the chart for better readability?\n\
  3. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars?\n4. Should the bars have\
  \ a specific width or spacing between them?\n5. Do you want the y-axis to start\
  \ at zero, or should it be adjusted to better display the differences in ratings?\n\
  6. Would you like to include data labels on top of the bars showing their exact\
  \ average ratings?\n7. Is there a specific chart title or subtitle you would like\
  \ to add? \n8. Do you prefer any specific type of legend or key for the different\
  \ colors used in the bars?"
