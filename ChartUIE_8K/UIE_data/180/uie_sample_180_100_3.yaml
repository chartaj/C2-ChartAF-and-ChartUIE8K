initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the distribution of average ratings
  for the top 5000 albums of all time. The x-axis should represent the average rating
  ranges, and the y-axis should indicate the frequency of albums in each rating range.
  Ensure that the bins are set to capture the nuances in rating variations effectively.
  The histogram should help us understand how common different rating levels are among
  the top albums, making it easier to identify trends or patterns in album ratings
  within the music industry dataset. Please use the 'Average Rating' data for this
  visualization.
