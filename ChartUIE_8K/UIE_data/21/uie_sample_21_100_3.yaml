initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart using data from '../Extra_datas/data/21.csv'
  to visualize the mean frequency, median, and mean fundamental frequency values for
  male voices. Use different colors to represent each parameter. Label each stack
  with their respective values and use a legend to differentiate them. The x-axis
  should show the different sample data points and the y-axis should display the frequency
  values. This chart is for a project on Gender Recognition by Voice for the arts
  and entertainment industry. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the mean frequency,
  median, and mean fundamental frequency values?

  2. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the labels on each stack in
  the bar chart?

  3. Should the x-axis display sample data points as labels, numerical values, or
  in another specific format?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style or format for the legend?

  5. Are there any specific title or axis labels you would like to include in the
  chart?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the overall dimensions or aspect ratio of the
  chart?

  7. Is there any specific way you would like the data points ordered on the x-axis
  (e.g., chronologically, by value, etc.)?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the specific font styles or sizes.

  3. I do not have any particular format in mind for the x-axis labels.
