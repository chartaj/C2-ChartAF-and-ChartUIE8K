initial_prompt: I want to create a bubble chart using the Gender Recognition by Voice
  dataset. The x-axis should represent 'meanfreq', the y-axis should represent 'median',
  and the bubble size should be determined by 'sd'. Different bubble colors should
  indicate 'label' (male or female). Make sure the chart clearly distinguishes the
  two genders and make the bubble sizes proportional to the spreading of the frequencies.
  Can you help me set up this visualization to effectively compare the frequency distributions
  between male and female voices?
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used to distinguish
  male and female voices?

  2. What size range do you prefer for the bubbles to ensure they are easily distinguishable
  yet proportional to the data?

  3. Would you like any specific axis limits or scaling for the x-axis (''meanfreq'')
  and y-axis (''median'')?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart''s title or any labels for the axes?

  5. Should grid lines be included in the background to enhance readability?

  6. Would you like to include any legend positioning preferences?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include grid lines.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
