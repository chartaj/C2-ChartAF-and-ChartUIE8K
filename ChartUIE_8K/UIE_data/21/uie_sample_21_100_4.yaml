initial_prompt: I would like a scatter plot to visualize the gender recognition data
  by voice. Specifically, please plot ‘meanfreq’ on the X-axis and ‘meanfun’ on the
  Y-axis, and use different colors to represent the 'label' (gender). Include data
  points for all the sample data provided. The plot should help differentiate between
  male and female speakers based on these attributes. Make sure the axes are labeled
  appropriately and include a legend to distinguish between genders. The title of
  the scatter plot can be "Gender Recognition by Voice." Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme to represent different
  genders?

  2. What font type and size do you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  3. Do you want the scatter plot markers to have a specific shape or size?

  4. Are there any specific grid line preferences for the X and Y axes?

  5. Would you like to include any additional text annotations or data point labels
  in the scatter plot?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the range limits of the X and Y axes?

  7. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the scatter plot?

  8. Are there any specific styles or themes you prefer for the overall appearance
  of the scatter plot?'
