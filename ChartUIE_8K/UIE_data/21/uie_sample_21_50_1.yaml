initial_prompt: Create a bar chart that compares the mean frequencies of different
  voice samples categorized by gender. Highlight significant statistical features
  such as meanfun, skew, and kurt for each bar. Annotate the chart with the sample
  data values to emphasize key points. This will help in gender recognition through
  voice features.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the bars representing
  different genders?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked?

  3. Do you prefer a particular style for annotating the sample data values (e.g.,
  inside the bars, above the bars, or as callouts)?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, horizontal, vertical, or both?

  5. Is there a preference for the type of font and its size for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to denote statistical features, or should they
  be directly annotated on the bars?

  7. How detailed should axis labels be (e.g., simple ''Male'' and ''Female'' labels
  or more descriptive)?

  8. Do you have a desired order for categories (e.g., placing ''Female'' first)?

  9. Should the mean, skew, and kurtosis values be highlighted differently, perhaps
  with different shapes or colors for annotations?

  10. Would you like error bars to be included to show variability or confidence intervals?'
