initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the "Gender Recognition by Voice"
  dataset. Focus on the average ('mean') values of features such as 'meanfreq', 'sd',
  'median', 'Q25', 'Q75', and 'meanfun' for male and female speakers. Use different
  colors to highlight male and female categories to show the comparison clearly. Include
  text annotations for key data points, such as the highest and lowest 'meanfreq'
  values, and use highlights for the 'meanfun' feature to emphasize its relevance
  in gender recognition. The chart should help in understanding gender differentiation
  based on voice features.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the specific colors used to differentiate
  male and female categories?

  2. Would you like a specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific font preferences for text annotations or labels?

  4. How would you prefer the data labels to be formatted for the highest and lowest
  ''meanfreq'' values?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or scales you prefer for the y-axis?

  6. Do you want gridlines to be displayed in the background of the chart? If yes,
  do you have any specific preference for their style?

  7. Is there a preference for where you would like the legend to be placed?

  8. Do you want tooltips to appear when hovering over the bars?'
