initial_prompt: I have a dataset titled "Gender Recognition by Voice" which falls
  under the arts-and-entertainment category. I'd like to visualize the gender distribution
  using a pie chart. Please create a pie chart showing the proportion of 'male' and
  'female' entries from the dataset. Use the 'label' column to determine gender count.
  The chart should clearly display percentages and be easily readable, ideally with
  distinct colors for each gender. This will help in understanding the gender ratio
  in voice data, which is essential for my research on voice characteristics. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors to represent ''male''
  and ''female''?

  2. Would you like the chart to include labels with the exact percentage values,
  or just the segments with color distinction?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style and size for the chart labels?

  4. Would you like the chart to have a title? If yes, please specify the title.

  5. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying percentages (e.g., one decimal
  place, no decimals)?

  6. Do you wish to include any additional information or legend within the chart?

  7. Should the pie chart include only the primary categories ''male'' and ''female'',
  or is there a need to represent any potential ''other'' or undefined categories
  if they exist?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like the segments to appear (e.g.,
  ''male'' first, or ''female'' first)?'
