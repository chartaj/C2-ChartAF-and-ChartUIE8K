initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between different features
  in the "Gender Recognition by Voice" dataset. Include all columns such as 'meanfreq',
  'sd', 'median', etc. Use different colors to represent the intensity of correlations.
  Highlight features that might indicate gender differences clearly. Make sure the
  color gradient helps identify strong and weak correlations easily. This will help
  in understanding which features have a significant relationship with each other
  and could potentially impact gender classification. Ensure the heatmap is clear
  and easy to read.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should the color gradient be diverging (e.g., from blue to red) or sequential
  (e.g., from light to dark)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific value range for the color gradient to emphasize strong
  and weak correlations?

  4. Would you like any specific annotations or labels on the heatmap cells?

  5. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  6. Should any specific features be highlighted more prominently in the heatmap?

  7. Is there any specific correlation threshold you want to highlight (e.g., correlations
  greater than 0.8)?

  8. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the heatmap to distinguish between
  cells?

  9. Is there a particular order in which you''d like the features to be displayed
  (e.g., hierarchical clustering)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Sequential (e.g., from light to dark).

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, labels on the heatmap cells would be helpful.

  5. I do not have a specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Correlations greater than 0.8 would be good to highlight.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I have no specific preference.'
