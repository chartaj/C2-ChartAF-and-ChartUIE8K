  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart to visualize the gas mileage and engine displacement across different
  automobiles. Annotate specific data points to highlight notable variations and ensure
  clear visual distinction for comparative analysis. This will help in understanding
  the relationship between engine displacement and fuel efficiency in vehicles.
