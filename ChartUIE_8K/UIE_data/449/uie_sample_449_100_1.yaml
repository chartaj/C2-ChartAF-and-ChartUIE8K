initial_prompt: 'Create a histogram for "Gas Mileage (mpg)" from the automobile data,
  with bins representing different mileage ranges. Highlight data points representing
  "Engine Displacement (cc)" to show correlation. Add text annotations for the bins
  with highest frequency, and those correlated with specific engine displacements.
  Purpose: To analyze the distribution of gas mileage among automobiles and its relation
  to engine displacement. This will help in understanding fuel efficiency trends based
  on engine size. Use vibrant colors for highlights to make important data stand out
  and make the histogram visually engaging.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the vibrant highlights?

  2. How many mileage ranges (bins) would you like to have on the histogram?

  3. Which specific engine displacement values should be highlighted and annotated?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font type or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like any additional titles or labels for the histogram?

  6. Should the histogram display grid lines? If yes, what style?

  7. Are there any specific preferences for the layout or orientation of the histogram?'
answers: "1. I do not have a specific preference.\n2. I am not sure. \n3. I do not\
  \ know.\n4. I have no specific preference.\n5. Yes, please add a title \"Gas Mileage\
  \ Distribution and Engine Displacement Correlation\" and labels for the x-axis \"\
  Gas Mileage (mpg)\" and y-axis \"Frequency\".\n6. Yes, display grid lines. I have\
  \ no specific preference for the style.\n7. I do not know."
data_attributes:
- Gas Mileage(mpg)
