  their engine displacement, gas mileage, acceleration from 0-60 mph, power in kilowatts,
  and weight. I'd like to create a violin plot that visualizes the distribution of
  engine displacement against gas mileage. This plot should reflect the variations
  and density of engine displacement across different gas mileage values. Please use
  the provided data format to accurately represent the distribution and spread of
  these variables. Ensure the plot clearly shows how engine displacement influences
  gas mileage. Thank you!

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
