initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart highlighting engine displacement,
  gas mileage, power, weight, and acceleration for automobiles. Annotate notable data
  points, specifically those with extreme gas mileage and engine displacement values,
  to compare their performance visually. Use different colors to differentiate the
  various data attributes.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to differentiate the
  various data attributes?

  2. What specific colors would you like to use for annotating notable data points?

  3. How would you prefer these extreme values to be annotated (e.g., using specific
  symbols, labels, or tooltips)?

  4. Do you have a preferred layout or aspect ratio for the parallel coordinates chart?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like to use for the text annotations
  and labels?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to explain the colors used for different data
  attributes?

  7. Do you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for connecting
  the data points in the parallel coordinates chart?

  8. Is there any specific order in which you would like the data attributes to be
  displayed on the axes?

  9. Would you like to highlight any other specific data points or ranges apart from
  those with extreme gas mileage and engine displacement values?

  10. How would you prefer the axes to be scaled (e.g., normalized to the same range
  or to their individual data ranges)?'

  6. Yes, please include a legend to explain the colors used for different data attributes.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.

  9. No, just the extreme gas mileage and engine displacement values are fine.

  10. I am not sure.'
