initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing information about automobiles, specifically
  their engine displacement, gas mileage, acceleration from 0-60 mph, power in kilowatts,
  and weight. I'd like to create a violin plot that visualizes the distribution of
  engine displacement against gas mileage. This plot should reflect the variations
  and density of engine displacement across different gas mileage values. Please use
  the provided data format to accurately represent the distribution and spread of
  these variables. Ensure the plot clearly shows how engine displacement influences
  gas mileage. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the violin plot?

  2. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the plot?

  3. Do you have any specific preference for the axis labels and title of the plot?

  4. Would you like to add any statistical summary or extra information (e.g., mean
  or median markers) within the violin plot?

  5. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the plot (vertical or horizontal)?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the text elements in
  the plot?

  7. Do you want to add grid lines to the background for better readability?

  8. Is there any additional contextual information or notes you would like to include
  on the plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, please include labels for engine displacement and gas mileage.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like to add mean markers within the violin plot.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please add grid lines to the background for better readability.

  8. I do not know.'
