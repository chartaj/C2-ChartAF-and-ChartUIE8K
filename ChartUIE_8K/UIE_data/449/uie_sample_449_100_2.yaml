initial_prompt: Create a parallel coordinates chart to visualize the automobile dataset,
  focusing on attributes like 0-60 mph, gas mileage, power, weight, and engine displacement.
  Use text annotations to highlight specific data points, such as vehicles with the
  best and worst gas mileage. Emphasize unique values and trends by modifying colors.
  The goal is to identify relationships between different attributes, such as how
  engine displacement correlates with weight and performance. Highlight outliers and
  patterns to provide insights on how these variables compare and contrast among different
  automobiles. Ensure the chart is visually clear and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme to emphasize
  unique values and trends?

  2. Are there specific color codes you would like us to use for highlighting best
  and worst gas mileage vehicles?

  3. Would you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Are there specific data points or vehicles besides those with the best and worst
  gas mileage that you want annotated?

  5. Do you have any preferred line styles or widths for the parallel coordinates
  chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the arrangement or order of the attributes on the
  parallel coordinates chart?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have a preference for the arrangement or order of the attributes.'
