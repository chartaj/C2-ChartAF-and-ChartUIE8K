initial_prompt: Create a histogram chart using the provided data about state-sponsored
  cyber operations from 2005 to present. The histogram should show the frequency of
  cyber operations over time, categorized by year, to identify trends and peaks in
  these activities. Use the 'Date' column to extract the year for the x-axis. The
  y-axis should represent the number of operations recorded each year. This will help
  visualize the temporal distribution of the cyber operations. Ensure each bar represents
  one year's worth of data for clear insights on yearly activities.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the bars in the histogram?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines in the background for easier reading of
  the values?

  3. Do you prefer the histogram bars to have spacing between them or to be directly
  adjacent?

  4. How would you like the x-axis to be labeled (e.g., Year, Year of Operation)?

  5. Would you like to include data labels showing the exact count of operations on
  top of each bar?

  6. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the axis labels and
  title?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Do you prefer a legend to be included in the histogram, even though it may not
  be necessary since it''s a single category?

  9. Do you want the y-axis to start from zero or auto-scale based on the data range?

  10. Should the histogram include annotations for significant peaks or notable years?'
