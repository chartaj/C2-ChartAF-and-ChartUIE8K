initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot visualizing state-sponsored cyber operations
  from 2005 to the present. Use the data provided to plot each incident based on its
  Title and Date. Highlight points by modifying their size or color to distinguish
  different Types and Categories of operations. Annotate specific data points with
  their Description and Sponsor to draw attention to significant events. The purpose
  of the chart is to illustrate patterns and trends in cyber operations over time,
  focusing on the varied types and categories of attacks. Ensure the annotations provide
  contextual details to aid viewer understanding.

  of operations?

  5. Are there any specific dates or ranges that you want to pay particular attention
  to?
