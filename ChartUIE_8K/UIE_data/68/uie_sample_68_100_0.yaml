initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the frequency of various cyber operations
  types over time, highlighting state-sponsored attacks. Annotate significant incidents
  of espionage, denial-of-service, and targeting of civil society. Emphasize key sponsors
  (Ghana, Belarus, Ukraine) and impacted sectors (government, private sector). Use
  highlights to distinguish between different categories such as political, government,
  and civil targets. The visualization should help identify patterns and trends in
  cyber operations from 2005 to present, drawing attention to noteworthy events and
  actors, making it easier to understand the landscape of state-sponsored cyber activities
  in the cybersecurity context.
