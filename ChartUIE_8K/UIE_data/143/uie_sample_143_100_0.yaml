initial_prompt: Create a line chart to visualize the "assumed_office" years of the
  U.S. 117th House of Representatives members against their "age" from the "born"
  data. Highlight significant years (e.g., 2003, 2021) when new members assumed office
  and annotate the ages of members at the time they took office. This will emphasize
  trends in the ages of representatives when starting their terms. Highlight any notable
  patterns or differences between parties if applicable. This will help to understand
  the demographics evolution and political trends among the U.S. House members over
  time.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting significant years
  (e.g., 2003, 2021)?

  2. Would you like specific line styles (e.g., dashed or solid) for different parties?

  3. Do you prefer the annotative text for ages to be displayed at the top, side,
  or bottom of the data points?

  4. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the annotations?

  5. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels have any specific titles or formatting?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, what style (e.g., dotted, solid)?

  7. Should there be different markers for each party (e.g., circles for Republicans,
  squares for Democrats)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or size of the chart?

  9. How would you like us to handle overlapping data points in the visualization?

  10. Are there any additional data points or labels you want to highlight on the
  chart?'
