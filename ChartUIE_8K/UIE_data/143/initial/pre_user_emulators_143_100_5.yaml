- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map showing the distribution of congressional members by party
  affiliation across different districts. Use the 'distict_name' to define the geographic
  areas and 'party' to represent the data visually. Include a legend to differentiate
  between 'Republican' and 'Democrat'. Highlight the 'assumed_office' year as an overlay
  to show new versus long-term representatives within the districts. This will help
  visualize political representation and tenure across the U.S. House of Representatives
  for the 117th Congress. Make sure the map is interactive, allowing us to hover over
  districts for more details about the members.
