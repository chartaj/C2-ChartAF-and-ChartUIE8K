initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the "assumed_office"
  and "born" columns for members of the U.S. 117th House of Representatives. Use the
  "party" column to color-code the points, distinguishing between Republicans and
  other party members. Implement text annotations to highlight members with unique
  educational backgrounds. The plot should emphasize the distribution of ages at which
  members assumed office. The purpose is to understand if there's a pattern or trend
  in the age of members when they first took office. Add a title and appropriate axis
  labels for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific title in mind for the scatter plot?

  2. What labels would you prefer for the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Are there any specific colors you would like to use for Republicans and other
  party members?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style for the text annotations?

  5. How would you like the unique educational backgrounds to be highlighted in the
  annotations (e.g., specific keywords, formatting)?

  6. Are there any specific age ranges or office assumption years you would like to
  emphasize?

  7. Would you prefer grid lines to be included or omitted in the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, any appropriate title would work.

  2. Assumed Office Year (x-axis), Year of Birth (y-axis)

  3. No specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Highlight in bold or different color keywords related to their educational backgrounds.
