initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map showing the distribution of congressional
  members by party affiliation across different districts. Use the 'distict_name'
  to define the geographic areas and 'party' to represent the data visually. Include
  a legend to differentiate between 'Republican' and 'Democrat'. Highlight the 'assumed_office'
  year as an overlay to show new versus long-term representatives within the districts.
  This will help visualize political representation and tenure across the U.S. House
  of Representatives for the 117th Congress. Make sure the map is interactive, allowing
  us to hover over districts for more details about the members.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for representing ''Republican''
  and ''Democrat'' parties on the map?

  2. How would you like the ''assumed_office'' years to be depicted as an overlay
  (e.g., different shades, patterns, or another form of visual representation)?

  3. Do you want any specific labeling on the map, such as displaying district names
  or member names directly on the map?

  4. Do you prefer any particular style or theme for the map (e.g., modern, classic,
  minimalistic)?

  5. How detailed should the legend be for distinguishing between parties and tenure
  (e.g., should it include year ranges for tenure)?

  6. Are there any specific regions or districts that you would like to highlight
  or focus more on within the map?'
