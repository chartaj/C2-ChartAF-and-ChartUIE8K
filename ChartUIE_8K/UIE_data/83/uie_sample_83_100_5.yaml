initial_prompt: I have some data related to people's demographics and their feedback
  on online food services. I would like to visualize this using a column chart. The
  chart should have the "Age" on the x-axis and the count of occurrences for each
  age group on the y-axis. It should be color-coded by "Gender". Additionally, I would
  like to include a separate column for each "Marital Status" within each age group
  to see how these categories distribute across different ages. This chart will help
  understand the demographics of food service users.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color palette used for gender differentiation?

  2. Would you like to specify particular age group intervals for the x-axis?

  3. How would you prefer marital statuses to be visually distinguished within each
  age group? (e.g., different shades, patterns)

  4. Do you want to include any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  5. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  titles?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for easier interpretation?

  7. Do you have any preference for the ordering of the age groups on the x-axis (e.g.,
  ascending)?

  8. Would you like to display the counts on top of each column for clarity?

  9. Are there any additional elements you would like to include, such as a legend
  or a title for the chart?

  10. How should missing or zero values be handled in the chart, if any exist?'
