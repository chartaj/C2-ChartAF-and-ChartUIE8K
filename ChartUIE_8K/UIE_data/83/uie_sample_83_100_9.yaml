initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap for the Online Food Dataset to show the correlation
  between Age, Monthly Income, Family size, and geographical coordinates (latitude
  and longitude). I want to see visually if there are patterns or correlations between
  these factors. Highlight areas where there is a higher density of data points and
  any significant variations. Also, use different colors to represent the range of
  values for better visualization of the data distribution and relationships. Ensure
  the heatmap is clear and properly labeled with legends. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the specific color palette to be used
  in the heatmap to represent different ranges of values?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to include annotations for specific data points or
  just color gradients to represent density and variations?

  3. Do you prefer the heatmap to have a specific scale or range for each attribute,
  such as age groups or income brackets?

  4. Are there any particular geographical regions you want the heatmap to focus on
  or highlight more prominently?

  5. Do you want any specific type of legends, such as continuous or discrete, for
  better interpretation of the heatmap?

  6. Are there specific labels or titles you want for the axes and the overall chart?

  7. Would you like to see any trend lines or additional markers to highlight significant
  correlations?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Just color gradients to represent density and variations.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Continuous legends for better interpretation.

  6. Labels for axes: Age, Monthly Income, Family Size, Latitude, Longitude. Title:
  Correlation Heatmap of Online Food Dataset.

  7. I am not sure.'
