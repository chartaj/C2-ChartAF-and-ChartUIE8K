initial_prompt: 'I have a dataset related to an online food ordering service and its
  users'' demographics and feedback. I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the feedback
  (Positive vs. Negative) based on the age groups of users. The x-axis should represent
  different age groups, and the y-axis should show the count of feedback in each group.
  Color code the bars for Positive and Negative feedback. This chart will help me
  understand how different age demographics feel about the service.


  Thank you!'
