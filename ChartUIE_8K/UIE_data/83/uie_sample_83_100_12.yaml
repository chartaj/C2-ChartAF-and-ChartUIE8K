initial_prompt: I have a dataset named 'Online Food Dataset' from the food-and-drink
  category, which includes information like Age, Gender, Marital Status, etc. I want
  a pie chart to visually represent the 'Output' column, showing the proportion of
  'Yes' and 'No' responses. This would help in understanding the distribution of positive
  outcomes among the survey participants regarding their online food preferences or
  experiences. Please ensure the chart is clear and labeled accurately for easy interpretation.
  Include percentage values on the pie slices for clarity. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the ''Yes'' and ''No''
  slices?

  2. Would you like the pie chart to include a legend, or should the slices be directly
  labeled?

  3. Do you prefer the pie chart to be 2D or 3D?

  4. Should the chart title include specific text, or would you like us to suggest
  a title?

  5. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and percentages?

  6. How would you like the slices to be ordered? (e.g., by value, alphabetically)

  7. Should any specific slice standout with a different emphasis, such as a shadow
  or larger size?

  8. Do you need any annotations or additional descriptions included on or around
  the chart?

  9. Would you like to display the actual count values along with the percentages
  on the slices?'
