initial_prompt: Please create a geographic heatmap using the provided Online Food
  Dataset related to food and drink. I'd like the heatmap to display the concentration
  of respondents based on their latitude and longitude data. It should visualize the
  distribution of participants' monthly income levels across different regions. Additionally,
  please highlight areas with higher average family sizes with gradient colors. The
  map should help identify potential hotspots for marketing food-related products
  and services. Please ensure the map is interactive, allowing for zooming and additional
  details on hover. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for the heatmap and
  gradient colors?

  2. What level of geographic detail do you prefer? (e.g., city, state, country)

  3. Should the income levels be grouped into specific ranges? If so, please provide
  the desired brackets.

  4. How many gradient bands would you like for highlighting family sizes?

  5. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the map?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the map''s base layer (e.g., satellite, terrain,
  or standard map)?

  7. Would you like to display a legend explaining the color gradients and income
  levels on the map?

  8. Is there a specific title or description you would like to include on the map?'
