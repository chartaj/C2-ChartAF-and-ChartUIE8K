initial_prompt: I have some student performance data, including their grades, demographic
  information, and family background. Could you create a pie chart showing the distribution
  of students based on their preference for higher education? Specifically, I want
  to know how many students plan to pursue higher education versus those who do not.
  This will help us understand the general inclination of students towards continuing
  their studies. Please use the data provided in the file to generate this visualization.
  Your assistance in creating this chart would be greatly appreciated!

  4. Would you like the chart to include a legend indicating what each section represents?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the labels and title?
