initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize student grades (G1, G2, G3) from the
  dataset. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight students with the highest
  and lowest final grades (G3). Add non-data-driven annotations to provide context
  about the dataset, such as the purpose of the study. Highlight bars representing
  students with consistent improvements or declines in grades to emphasize their performance
  trends. The chart should focus the viewerâ€™s attention on the distribution and variation
  in student grades across different evaluation periods.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the bars representing different
  grades (G1, G2, G3)?

  2. Do you have a preference for the font style and size for the text annotations?

  3. How would you like the data-driven text annotations (highest and lowest final
  grades) to be positioned on the chart?

  4. Would you prefer the bars representing consistent improvements or declines in
  grades to be highlighted using different colors or patterns?

  5. Is there a specific title you want for the bar chart?

  6. Do you have a preference for the layout of the axis labels and titles?

  7. Is there any specific information or context you want included in the non-data-driven
  annotations?

  8. How detailed should the non-data-driven annotations about the purpose of the
  study be?

  9. Do you prefer vertical or horizontal bars for this chart?

  10. Should the chart include grid lines to enhance readability, and if so, how prominent
  should they be?'
