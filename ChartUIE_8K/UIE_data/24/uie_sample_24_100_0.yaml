initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of student
  grades (G3) from the provided dataset. Use text annotations to highlight key points,
  particularly the highest and lowest grade groups, to draw attention to those ranges.
  Additionally, incorporate highlights on bars representing students with the highest
  studytime and lowest failures to emphasize their impact on grades. This visual representation
  will help understand how various factors like study time and past failures influence
  final grades within the education context. Make sure the chart is easy to comprehend
  and visually engaging for educational analysts.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the bars and
  text annotations?

  2. What font style and size would you like the text annotations to be?

  3. Would you like the chart to include gridlines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer any specific bin width for the histogram?

  5. Should the histogram include a title and axis labels? If so, do you have specific
  wording in mind?

  6. Do you have any preference for the placement of the legend within the chart?

  7. Would you like to include any specific notes or captions to further explain the
  chart?'
