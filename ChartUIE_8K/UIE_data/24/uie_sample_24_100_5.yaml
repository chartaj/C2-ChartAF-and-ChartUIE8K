initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize students' academic performance over
  three grading periods (G1, G2, G3). Please plot the grades for each student and
  show how their performance changes over these periods. Use different lines to represent
  individual students and ensure it's easy to compare their progress. For the x-axis,
  use the grading periods (G1, G2, G3), and for the y-axis, use the grade scores.
  Also, make sure to highlight any patterns or significant trends across these periods.
  This will help in understanding their academic developments. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  individual students?

  2. Would you like to include markers on the lines to indicate individual data points?

  3. Is there any particular style you prefer for the lines (solid, dashed, dotted)?

  4. Do you want a legend included in the chart to identify the lines for each student?

  5. Should we include grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  6. Do you prefer the x-axis and y-axis to have specific labels or titles?

  7. Would you like axis ranges to be fixed or should they adjust based on the data?

  8. Should the chart include annotations or text highlighting significant patterns
  or trends?

  9. Would you like the data points to be labeled with their exact grade scores?

  10. Are there any particular fonts or styles you prefer for the chart text and labels?

  11. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
