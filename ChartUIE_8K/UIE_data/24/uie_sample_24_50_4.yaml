initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of students'
  final grades (G3). Use the columns 'age', 'studytime', 'failures', 'Dalc', and 'Walc'
  as categories for separate box plots. This will help in understanding how these
  factors vary among students and impact grades.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the box plots?

  2. Do you want the box plots to be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Should outliers be displayed separately in the box plots?

  4. Do you have a specific order in which the categories should be displayed?

  5. Would you like to include a summary statistic (e.g., mean) overlay on the box
  plots?

  6. Would you prefer any specific labels or titles for the axes and the chart?

  7. Is there a particular style or theme you would like the chart to follow (e.g.,
  minimalist, detailed)?

  8. Should individual data points be plotted within the box plots?

  9. Do you need grid lines on the chart for reference?

  10. Do you have any specific font preferences for titles and labels?'
