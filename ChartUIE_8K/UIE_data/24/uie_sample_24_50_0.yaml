initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing the distribution of students' final
  grades (G3). Annotate specific data points to highlight students with outstanding
  performance. Use color highlights to differentiate between male and female students.
  The goal is to understand grade distribution patterns across genders and identify
  top achievers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting male and female
  students?

  top 10%, grades above a specific threshold)?

  3. How would you like the annotations for top achievers to be displayed (e.g., text
  labels, special markers)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the bin size or range of grades in the
  histogram?

  5. Would you like to include any specific titles or labels for the axes and chart?
  If so, please specify.

  6. Are there any additional details or elements you would like to highlight in the
  chart?'
