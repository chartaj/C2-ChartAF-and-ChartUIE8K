initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart to visualize the popularity of baby names
  over the years. The x-axis should represent the "Year of Birth" and the y-axis will
  show the "Count" of each name. Different "Gender" categories should be represented
  by different colors within each bar. The chart should help identify trends in names'
  popularity, highlighting any differences in name preference between genders over
  time. Please ensure that the chart is clear and easy to interpret, as it will be
  used for a presentation on social trends in baby naming.
questions: "1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for representing the\
  \ gender categories in the stacked bar chart?\n2. Would you like gridlines to be\
  \ displayed on the chart for easier interpretation of values? \n3. Is there a preferred\
  \ font style or size for the labels and title on the chart?\n4. Should the chart\
  \ include a legend to distinguish between the gender categories? \n5. Do you prefer\
  \ any specific sorting order of years on the x-axis (e.g., ascending, descending)?\n\
  6. Would you like to display data labels (e.g., the count value) on each bar segment?\n\
  7. Are there any specific title or subtitle texts you would like to include on the\
  \ chart?\n8. Should the y-axis scale be linear or logarithmic?\n9. Do you have any\
  \ particular preference for the aspect ratio of the chart?\n10. Would you like to\
  \ include annotations or markers to highlight significant trends or shifts in the\
  \ data?"
