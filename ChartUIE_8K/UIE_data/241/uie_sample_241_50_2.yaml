initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of popular baby names
  based on gender, ethnicity, and rank. Highlight the top-ranked names in each category.

  information such as percentages?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the segments of the pie chart to follow
  (e.g., alphabetical, by count)?
