2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot using the provided data formats. Each data format represents
  distinct variables (x, y, z). Use x.1, y.1, and z.1 as the axes values for the scatter
  plot. Ensure it highlights important data points with text annotations displaying
  values. The purpose is to visualize relationships and emphasize key trends, particularly
  variations in floating point values like x.1, y.1, and z.1. Use distinctive colors
  or sizes to draw attention to notable points. This practical visualization can help
  understand complex structures, such as the Klein Bottle, in data science and analytics.
