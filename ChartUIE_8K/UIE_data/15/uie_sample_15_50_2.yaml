initial_prompt: Visualize a heatmap using columns x.1, y.1, and z.1. Highlight points
  with unique trends. Annotate significant clustering or anomalies. This aids in understanding
  the Klein Bottle data distribution.
questions: '1. Do you prefer a specific color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should there be a color legend indicating the values corresponding to different
  colors on the heatmap?

  3. Do you want the heatmap to have grid lines?

  4. Is there a preferred scale or normalization method for the color intensity in
  the heatmap?

  5. Would you like data points to be highlighted using a particular color or marker?

  6. Are there specific thresholds or criteria for defining ''significant clustering''
  or ''anomalies''?

  7. Should annotations include statistical metrics or just descriptive text?

  8. Do you have a preferred method for annotating significant clusters (e.g., labels,
  arrows, different markers)?

  9. Do you want the clustering and anomaly annotations to be color-coded differently
  from the heatmap colors?

  10. How detailed should the annotations be? Would you prefer short labels or more
  descriptive comments?

  11. Should the heatmap include axis titles and labels for better context?

  12. Do you require any specific aspect ratio or size for the visualization?'
