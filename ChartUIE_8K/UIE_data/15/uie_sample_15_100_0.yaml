initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart using the provided data. Plot 'x.1' on the x-axis
  and 'y.1' on the y-axis. The size of the bubbles should represent the values of
  'z.1'. Ensure that there are textual annotations for notable data points in 'x.1'
  and 'y.1' to highlight important values. Use different colors to distinguish between
  different ranges of 'z.1' for better visual contrast and emphasis. This will help
  in analyzing patterns and specific trends within the dataset effectively, serving
  practical decision-making needs. Add non-data-driven annotations for context and
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  ranges of ''z.1''?

  2. Are there specific thresholds or ranges for ''z.1'' that you want to assign particular
  colors to?

  3. What specific data points in ''x.1'' and ''y.1'' do you consider notable and
  require textual annotations?

  4. Do you prefer bubble sizes to be proportional in a certain way (e.g., linear
  scaling, logarithmic scaling)?

  5. What non-data-driven annotations or context information would you like to include
  on the chart (e.g., title, subtitle, source, footnotes)?

  6. Are there any specific design elements or styles you want (e.g., font types,
  background color, gridlines)?'

  1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. For notable data points in ''x.1'' and ''y.1'', highlight the extremes like maximum
  and minimum values.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Include a title like "Bubble Chart Analysis of Dataset" and a subtitle explaining
  the axes and bubble sizes. Also, a footnote mentioning the data source.

  6. I have no specific preference.
