initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between columns in the
  dataset. The heatmap will help identify patterns and relationships between `x.1`,
  `x.2`, `y.1`, `y.2`, `z.1`, and `z.2`. Use color gradients to indicate the strength
  of correlations. Add annotations to highlight key correlations, focusing the viewer's
  attention on significant relationships. The practical purpose is to provide insights
  into interdependencies between different variables in a Klein Bottle data context,
  important for data science analysis. Include text annotations for clarity and context.
  Use distinct colors to highlight significant correlations for easy identification.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color gradients for indicating the strength\
  \ of correlations?\n2. Are there specific colors you would like to use to highlight\
  \ significant correlations?\n3. What font style and size do you prefer for text\
  \ annotations?\n4. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the heatmap\
  \ (e.g., square, rectangular, rotated)?\n5. Are there any specific correlation thresholds\
  \ that you consider significant and want highlighted? \n6. Do you prefer any specific\
  \ style for annotation borders or highlights (e.g., bold, different color)?\n7.\
  \ Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color gradient and correlation\
  \ strength?\n8. Do you have preferences for the axis labels and titles' formatting?\n\
  9. Is there any particular way you want to handle or display equal values for `x.2`,\
  \ `y.2`, and `z.2`?"

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I prefer a clear and readable font style, maybe Arial or Helvetica, and a moderate
  size like 10-12.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Correlations above 0.7 or below -0.7 should be highlighted.

  6. Bold annotation borders would be nice.

  7. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color gradient and correlation strength.

  8. I prefer clear and straightforward formatting for axis labels and titles.

  9. I am not sure.
