initial_prompt: Please create a line chart using the provided data with columns x.1,
  y.1, and z.1 plotted on the same graph. Highlight the specific points that fall
  at the beginning, middle, and end of the dataset with a different color or size.
  Add data-driven annotations to highlight the values of these specific points. Ensure
  that the lines for x.1, y.1, and z.1 are distinguishable with different colors.
  The purpose of this visualization is to compare the trends of these three variables
  over the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the lines representing
  the columns x.1, y.1, and z.1?

  2. Would you prefer the highlighted points at the beginning, middle, and end of
  the dataset to be marked with a different color or a different size, or both?

  3. Is there any particular style you prefer for the data-driven annotations (e.g.,
  data labels, tooltip pop-ups)?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to identify the lines for x.1, y.1, and z.1?
  If yes, any preferences on where this legend should be placed (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the axis titles and their formats?

  6. Should the chart include grid lines to enhance readability? If so, do you have
  preferences for their appearance?

  7. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for the chart labels
  and annotations?

  8. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, do you have a specific
  title in mind?

  9. Do you have any preference for the overall dimensions or aspect ratio of the
  chart?'
