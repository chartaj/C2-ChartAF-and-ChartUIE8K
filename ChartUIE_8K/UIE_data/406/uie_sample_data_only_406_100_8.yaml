  continent, life expectancy, population, and GDP per capita. It looks like this data
  is meant to help analyze global economic and social conditions. Could you create
  a column chart for me that compares the GDP per capita and life expectancy for these
  countries? I'd like to see how countries from different continents fare in terms
  of these two aspects. Make sure to clearly indicate the countries and their respective
  continents on the chart. Thanks!

  Given the accurate data and user request, your task is to delve into the user request
  to figure out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select
  the most suitable task that the user is willing to do from the list of various tasks
  in data visualization, (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request
  in data visualization, and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
