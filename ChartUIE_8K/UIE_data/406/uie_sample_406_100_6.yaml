initial_prompt: Create a violin plot comparing GDP per capita across different continents
  to analyze wealth distribution. Use data from '406.csv' which includes GDP per capita
  and continent information. The plot should visualize the spread and density of GDP
  values for each continent, highlighting the economic disparity. Add appropriate
  labels for the X-axis (Continents) and Y-axis (GDP per capita). The color should
  differ by continent for better distinction. This will help us understand the economic
  variances and patterns across different regions effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette or specific colors
  to represent each continent?

  2. Would you like the continents to be displayed in a specific order on the X-axis?

  3. Should the Y-axis use a logarithmic scale due to potential wide range of GDP
  per capita values?

  4. Are there any specific annotations or highlights you would like to include within
  the plot?

  5. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and titles on
  the axes?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to identify the colors representing each continent?

  7. Do you have a preference for the width of the violins to emphasize certain aspects
  of the distribution?

  8. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the Y-axis should use a logarithmic scale.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to identify the colors representing each continent.

  7. I am not sure.
