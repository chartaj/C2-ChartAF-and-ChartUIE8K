initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the distribution of life expectancy
  (lifeExp) for countries in different continents. Make sure to differentiate between
  continents using different colors or shades in the histogram. Additionally, include
  appropriate axis labels and a legend to indicate which color corresponds to which
  continent. The title of the histogram should be "Life Expectancy Distribution by
  Continent." This will help us understand the variation in life expectancy across
  different regions worldwide. Ensure the histogram bins are set to a reasonable width
  to clearly show the distribution patterns.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for differentiating
  the continents?

  2. What bin width or range would you consider reasonable for the histogram?

  3. Do you want gridlines to be included in the histogram for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for the title, axis labels,
  and legend?

  5. Do you want any specific formatting for axis labels, such as rotation or alignment?

  6. Would you prefer the histogram to be displayed in a landscape or portrait format?

  7. Is there any additional information or annotation you would like to include in
  the histogram?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I think a bin width of 5 years might be reasonable.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure about fonts or text sizes.

  5. I have no specific preference for axis label formatting.

  6. I would prefer the histogram to be displayed in landscape format.

  7. I do not have any additional information or annotations to include.'
