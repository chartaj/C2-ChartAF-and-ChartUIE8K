initial_prompt: Create a heatmap using the dataset from "GDP & Life Expectancy" social-science
  data. The heatmap should show the relationship between life expectancy and GDP per
  capita across different countries, differentiated by continents. Use "lifeExp" on
  one axis and "gdpPercap" on the other axis. Each cell's color should represent the
  population size ("pop") of the corresponding country to add another layer of information.
  Ensure the continental differences are clearly distinguishable, potentially by using
  annotations or color gradation for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for differentiating
  continents?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers on the heatmap?

  3. How would you prefer the population size to be represented through the color
  gradation?

  4. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to include to enhance
  the interpretability of the heatmap?

  5. Do you have a preference for the scaling method to be used for GDP per capita
  or life expectancy axes (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  6. Would you like a title or description to be included on the heatmap? If so, what
  should it be?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like population size to be represented through a color gradation that
  becomes darker with larger populations.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to explain the colors for population size and indicate
  which colors correspond to which continents.

  5. Linear scaling would be preferred for both axes.

  6. Yes, please include a title. The title should be "Relationship between Life Expectancy
  and GDP per Capita across Continents".
