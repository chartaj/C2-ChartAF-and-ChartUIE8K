initial_prompt: Create a table chart visualizing text and category from the dataset.

  and unique categories to understand word distribution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to highlight unique
  subjects and missing values?

  on each data point?

  3. How would you like the unique categories to be emphasized - through color, bolding,
  or another method?

  4. Would you prefer the table to be sorted in a specific order, such as by frequency
  of categories or alphabetically?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for readability of the table?

  6. Should we include any kind of pagination if the dataset is very large, or do
  you prefer to view it all at once?

  7. Do you want a summary section at the top or bottom of the table that quickly
  outlines key insights such as the number of unique subjects or missing values?

  8. Would you like to incorporate any specific symbols or icons to represent unique
  subjects or missing values for quick identification?

  9. Are you interested in having filter options within the table to sift through
  different categories or text entries?
