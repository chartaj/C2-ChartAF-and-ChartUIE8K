initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trend of Beats Per Minute,
  Energy, Danceability, Loudness, and Valence over the top 50 Spotify songs in 2019.
  Use the data from the CSV file located at '../Extra_datas/data/85.csv'. The x-axis
  should represent the track names, and the y-axis should measure the respective values
  for each parameter. This chart will help analyze the patterns and trends in musical
  features across popular songs. Make sure to distinguish each line with different
  colors and include a legend for clarity.

  parameter?

  If yes, horizontal, vertical, or both?

  5. Should the track names on the x-axis be rotated for better readability?

  6. Do you have a preference for the positioning of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  7. Would you like to include data points (markers) on the lines for each track?

  8. Do you have a preference for the overall layout or aspect ratio of the chart?
