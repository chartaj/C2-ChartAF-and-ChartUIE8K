initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the distribution of Energy,
  Danceability, and Loudness for the top 50 Spotify songs of 2019. Specifically, I
  want to see how the values vary for each of these attributes within the dataset.
  Include labels for the axes and a title that makes it clear this is related to the
  top songs of 2019. Additionally, ensure that the chart is visually appealing and
  easy to interpret, highlighting any potential outliers within the data. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you like to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels and title?

  4. Are there any specific styles or themes you want to be used for the chart (e.g.
  minimalist, bold, etc.)?

  5. Would you like to see any additional statistical details on the chart, such as
  mean or median lines?

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  7. Are there any annotations or text descriptions you want to include in the chart
  to highlight specific points?

  8. Should the outliers be marked with a specific symbol or color?'
