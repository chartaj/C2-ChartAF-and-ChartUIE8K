initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the Top 50 Spotify Songs data from
  2019. Plot "Beats.Per.Minute" on the x-axis and "Popularity" on the y-axis. Highlight
  the most popular songs by increasing the point size and use annotations to call
  out the highest and lowest popularity values with their respective song names. Ensure
  that the genres are differently colored to distinguish them. The purpose is to visualize
  trends between song tempo and popularity, and to easily identify standout tracks
  in terms of popularity. Keep the chart visually engaging and informative.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  genres?

  2. What size of annotations (font size, style) do you prefer for the highest and
  lowest popularity values?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the color coding for
  genres?

  4. Should the background of the plot be plain or have grid lines for better readability?

  5. Do you prefer a specific shape for the plotted points, or is the default circle
  acceptable?

  6. Would you like the axes to have specific labels or descriptions beyond the attribute
  names (e.g., ''Beats Per Minute (BPM)'' instead of just ''Beats.Per.Minute'')?

  7. Is there a specific size or aspect ratio you prefer for the overall chart?

  8. Would you like any additional statistical information displayed, such as a trend
  line or correlation coefficient?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the title or subtitle of the chart?'
