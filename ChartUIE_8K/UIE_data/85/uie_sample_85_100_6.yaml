initial_prompt: Create a bar chart to visualize the "Top 50 Spotify Songs - 2019"
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the "Track Name" and the y-axis should represent

  the chart easy to read with clearly labeled axes and a title. This will help in
  quickly understanding which tracks were the most popular in 2019.
