initial_prompt: Generate a histogram showing the distribution of 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc',
  and 'dlsrc' by state. Ensure the bins accurately represent the frequency counts
  for each category.
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for distinguishing between ''mlsrc'',
  ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc''?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  3. Should the histograms for ''mlsrc'', ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc'' be displayed
  on the same plot or on separate plots?

  4. Do you prefer a specific arrangement for the states on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical
  order)?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the histogram?

  6. Is there a preferred title or labels for the axes you want to use?

  7. Do you require any annotations or markers to highlight specific values or ranges
  on the histogram?

  8. Would you like to add a legend to differentiate between ''mlsrc'', ''quantumsrc'',
  and ''dlsrc''?

  9. Is there a specific font style or size preference for the text in the visualization?

  10. Are there any specific guidelines for the overall styling or layout of the histogram
  (e.g., margins, background color)?'
