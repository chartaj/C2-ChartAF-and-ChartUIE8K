initial_prompt: '

  I''d like a Choropleth map visualizing the data from 323.csv. The map should display
  Indian states, using different shades to represent the values of ''mlsrc'', ''quantumsrc'',
  and ''dlsrc''. Each state should be color-coded according to its respective data,
  letting observers easily compare the data points visually. Include a legend to denote
  the value ranges for mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc. This will be used to analyze
  trends in machine learning, quantum computing, and deep learning sources across
  states. Ensure the map is clear and informative for online communities exploring
  these trends.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different shades representing
  ''mlsrc'', ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc''?

  2. Would you like the legend to be positioned in a specific location on the map?

  3. Should the map include state boundaries for better clarity?

  4. Do you want to display data values on the map itself?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the state labels and legend?

  6. Would you like the data values to be normalized across the states for a more
  comparative view?

  7. Do you prefer any specific range intervals for the legend?

  8. Should the map include any geographic landmarks or additional context for better
  orientation?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, the map should include state boundaries for better clarity.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Yes, please normalize the data values across the states for a more comparative
  view.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
