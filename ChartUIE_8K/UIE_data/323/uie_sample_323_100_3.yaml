initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart comparing 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc'
  across the different states using the data provided. Each bar should represent one
  of these metrics for a single state. Use different colors to distinguish between
  'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc'. The x-axis should have the names of the states,
  and the y-axis should represent the values of 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc'.
  This will help in visualizing trends in online communities across various states.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing ''mlsrc'',
  ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc''?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability of values?

  3. Should the y-axis show absolute values only, or would you prefer percentage values
  as well?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you would prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the x-axis labels (horizontal,
  vertical, or angled)?

  6. Would you like to add data labels on top of each bar for better clarity?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  positioned (e.g., top, bottom, left, or right)?

  8. Are there any specific states that you would like to highlight or emphasize in
  the chart?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart, and if so, what
  should they be?'
