initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the web search trends from Google
  Trends by state. Highlight the intensity of online community interest in each state
  using various color shades. Include the data sources mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc
  in the visualization.
questions: "1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the choropleth map?\n2.\
  \ Would you like a legend to be included to explain the color shades used?\n3. Should\
  \ the map display absolute values or normalized values (e.g., per capita)?\n4. Do\
  \ you want labels or tooltips for each state with detailed information?\n5. How\
  \ should we handle states with no data or zero interest? \n6. Would you prefer the\
  \ data sources (mlsrc, quantumsrc, dlsrc) to be combined into a single metric, or\
  \ displayed separately?\n7. Is there a specific geographical projection you prefer\
  \ for the map?"
