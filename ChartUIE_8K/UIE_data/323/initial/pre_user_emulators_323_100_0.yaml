  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart visualizing the search trends for different states in India
  over a specific period. The chart should display the 'state' on the x-axis and search
  interest values from 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc' on the y-axis. Utilize text
  annotations to showcase significant values for states like 'Andhra Pradesh', 'Arunanchal
  Pradesh', and 'Andaman & Nicobar Island'. Highlight the top and bottom search interests
  to focus attention on states with the most and least search activity. The purpose
  is to analyze and compare the online engagement across different states.
