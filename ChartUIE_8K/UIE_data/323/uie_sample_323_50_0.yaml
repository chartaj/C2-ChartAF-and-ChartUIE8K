initial_prompt: Create a line chart comparing 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc' across
  states. Highlight key states with highest and lowest values for each source. Add
  annotations to describe trends and anomalies. This will help in understanding state-level
  distribution and trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like the key states with highest and lowest values to be marked with
  specific shapes or symbols?

  3. Is there a specific font size or style you prefer for annotations and labels?

  4. Do you want the lines for ''mlsrc'', ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc'' to be differentiated
  by line styles (e.g., solid, dashed, dotted)?

  5. Should there be a legend explaining the different line styles or colors for ''mlsrc'',
  ''quantumsrc'', and ''dlsrc''?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the layout or orientation of state labels
  on the x-axis?

  7. Would you like the chart to have gridlines for easier comparison of values?'
