initial_prompt: I need a grouped column chart to compare the number of missing values
  and unique values across different data columns in various states. The data includes
  states along with mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc values. For each state, show distinct
  columns for mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc so I can easily compare these sources.
  This chart should give a clear visualization of how different states stack up in
  terms of these sources. Use colors to distinguish between mlsrc, quantumsrc, and
  dlsrc values. The x-axis should represent different states and the y-axis should
  represent the values from data columns.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between mlsrc,
  quantumsrc, and dlsrc values?

  2. How would you like to handle the ordering of states on the x-axis? Alphabetical
  order or by data values?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labels or annotations to be added to the columns for
  better clarity?

  4. What level of axis labeling detail do you prefer for the x-axis (states) and
  y-axis (values)?

  5. Is there a specific font type or size you prefer for the chart labels and titles?

  6. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?
  If so, should they be on the x-axis, y-axis, or both?

  7. Do you prefer any specific styling for the chart borders or background (e.g.,
  no borders, light background)?

  8. Would you like a legend to be included? If yes, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)?

  9. Should there be any specific titles or subtitles for the chart to make it more
  descriptive?

  10. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the values displayed on the
  y-axis (e.g., integers, percentages)?'
