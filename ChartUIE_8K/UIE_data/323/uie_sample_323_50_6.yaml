initial_prompt: Create a column chart comparing 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc'
  for each state. The x-axis should represent the states, and the y-axis should represent
  the counts.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preference for the color scheme of the columns?\n\
  2. Would you like the columns for 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc' to be clustered\
  \ together or stacked?\n3. Are there any specific states that you would like to\
  \ highlight in the chart?\n4. Do you prefer a specific order for the states on the\
  \ x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, order of counts)?\n5. Should the chart include data\
  \ labels displaying the exact counts on each column?\n6. Do you require a legend\
  \ to differentiate between 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc'?\n7. Is there a specific\
  \ font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?\n8. Would you like\
  \ gridlines on the chart to enhance readability?\n9. Do you need the chart to include\
  \ a title? If so, do you have a specific title in mind? \n10. Should there be any\
  \ specific annotations or additional information displayed along with the chart?"
