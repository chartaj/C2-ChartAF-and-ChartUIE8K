initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing the search trends for different states
  in India over a specific period. The chart should display the 'state' on the x-axis
  and search interest values from 'mlsrc', 'quantumsrc', and 'dlsrc' on the y-axis.
  Utilize text annotations to showcase significant values for states like 'Andhra
  Pradesh', 'Arunanchal Pradesh', and 'Andaman & Nicobar Island'. Highlight the top
  and bottom search interests to focus attention on states with the most and least
  search activity. The purpose is to analyze and compare the online engagement across
  different states.
