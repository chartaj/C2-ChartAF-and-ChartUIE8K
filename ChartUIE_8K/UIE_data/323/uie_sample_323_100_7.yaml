initial_prompt: 'I have data comprising state-wise values for three sources: mlsrc,
  quantumsrc, and dlsrc, with no missing values. Visualize this as histograms showing
  the distribution of mlsrc, quantumsrc, and dlsrc values. Since these are different
  sources, use separate histograms for each category to illustrate the data. Make
  sure the X-axis represents the states, and the Y-axis shows the values. Include
  a legend for clarity. The chart should help in analyzing which states have the highest
  or lowest contributions from each source.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the histograms?

  2. What title would you like for each histogram?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be visible in the histograms?

  5. Do you prefer any specific order for the states on the X-axis (e.g., alphabetical,
  by value)?

  6. Should the Y-axis be scaled linearly or logarithmically?

  7. Are there any particular annotations or data markers you want included?

  8. Do you have a preference for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the charts?'
