initial_prompt: I need a column chart visualizing the data from 323.csv. The chart
  should show the states on the x-axis and have three separate bars for mlsrc, quantumsrc,
  and dlsrc values for each state. This chart will help us analyze which states have
  the highest values in each of the three data sources. Also, use different colors
  for each data source for better distinction and add a legend to clarify. We're mainly
  interested in understanding the trends in online communities usage across different
  states. Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each data source (mlsrc,
  quantumsrc, dlsrc)?

  2. Would you like the states on the x-axis to be sorted in any particular order
  (e.g., alphabetical, by total value)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for axis labels and legends?

  4. Should the bars have any particular width or spacing between them?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you want gridlines included in the chart for better readability?

  7. Are there any specific annotations or data labels you would like on the bars?

  8. Do you have any preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?'

  2. By total value.

  8. I have no specific preference.'
