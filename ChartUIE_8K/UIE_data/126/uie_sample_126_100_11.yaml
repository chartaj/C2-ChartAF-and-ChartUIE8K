initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart representing the "ocean_proximity" categories
  distribution from the California Housing Prices dataset. The chart should visually
  depict the proportion of each unique "ocean_proximity" label such as 'NEAR BAY',
  'INLAND', 'NEAR OCEAN', 'ISLAND', 'LESS THAN ONE HOUR TO OCEAN' based on the number
  of occurrences in the dataset. Ensure the chart is labeled clearly with appropriate
  legends for each category to understand the distribution easily. This will help
  analyze the housing prices in relation to their proximity to the ocean.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for each "ocean_proximity" category
  in the pie chart?

  2. Do you prefer the chart to include percentage labels on each pie slice, or would
  you prefer just the category names?

  3. What specific title would you like for the pie chart?

  4. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the labels and legends in the
  chart?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a detailed legend with explanations for each
  category?

  6. Is there a specific order in which you would like the categories to be displayed
  (e.g., from the most occurrences to the least)?

  7. Are there any specific design elements (e.g., 3D effects, shadows, borderlines)
  that you would like included in the pie chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the placement of the legend within the chart
  area (e.g., right, bottom, left, top)?

  9. Would you like to include any supplementary information or annotations on the
  pie chart to provide further context for the data?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences regarding the aspect ratio or size of the
  pie chart?'
