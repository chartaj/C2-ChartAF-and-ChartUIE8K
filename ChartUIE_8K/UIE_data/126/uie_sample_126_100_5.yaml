initial_prompt: I want an Area chart that depicts trends in California housing prices
  over various ages of housing. The x-axis should represent the housing median age
  from the data, and the y-axis should display the median house value. The regions
  in the Area chart should be differentiated by the 'ocean_proximity' attribute to
  show how proximity to the ocean affects housing values over time. Highlight missing
  data clearly if possible. Use different colors for each 'ocean_proximity' category
  to make it clear and visually appealing. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the different ''ocean_proximity''
  categories?

  2. Do you prefer specific colors to highlight the missing data?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for easier interpretation?

  4. Do you want annotations on the chart for significant data points or trends?

  5. What level of detail do you expect in the axis labels and tooltips?

  6. Do you prefer a specific style for the chart legend (e.g., position, size, format)?

  7. Would you like the chart to have a title and subtitles? If so, what should they
  be?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for text elements on the
  chart?

  9. Should the chart be optimized for viewing on a specific device or screen size?

  10. Would you like any additional contextual information or notes to be included
  on the chart?
