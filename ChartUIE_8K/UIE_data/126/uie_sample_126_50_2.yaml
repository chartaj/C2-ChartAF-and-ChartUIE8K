initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize California housing prices data, specifically
  comparing median house values against ocean proximity. Annotate key values and highlight
  regions with extreme housing prices. This will help identify pricing trends based
  on location, enhancing real estate analysis and decisions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to display a legend for interpreting the color scales?

  3. Should there be specific numerical ranges or thresholds highlighted on the heatmap?

  4. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the annotation of key
  values?

  5. Would you like the extreme housing prices to be highlighted using a particular
  visual marker or color?

  6. Would you prefer the regions to be labeled with ocean proximity categories?

  7. Is there any specific geographic boundary or region within California that you
  want the heatmap to focus on?

  8. Do you need any additional data layers (like city boundaries or major roads)
  overlaid on the heatmap for context?

  9. How granular do you want the comparison to be (e.g., by neighborhood, zip code,
  etc.)?

  10. Do you have a preference for the orientation or aspect ratio of the heatmap?'
