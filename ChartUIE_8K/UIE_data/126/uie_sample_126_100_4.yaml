initial_prompt: I have a dataset on California housing prices. Please create a scatter
  plot for me. On the x-axis, plot the longitude values, and on the y-axis, plot the
  latitude values. Use color coding to represent the median_house_value, with a gradient
  scale to show variation from lower to higher values. Additionally, use different
  marker sizes to indicate the population of different areas, so that I can visually
  see density differences. Finally, please include a legend for the ocean_proximity
  category to differentiate between various coastal proximities. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color gradient used to
  represent the ''median_house_value''?

  2. What color palette would you prefer for the different categories of ''ocean_proximity''
  in the legend?

  3. How would you like the marker sizes to be scaled relative to ''population''?

  4. Do you prefer any specific type or style of markers for the scatter plot?

  5. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the plot for better
  reference, and if so, how prominent should they be?

  6. Is there any particular font style or size you would like for the axis labels
  and legend text?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like the marker sizes to vary proportionally with the population so that
  larger populations have larger markers.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, including gridlines would be good, but I am not sure how prominent they
  should be.

  6. I do not have a preference for the font style or size for the axis labels and
  legend text.
