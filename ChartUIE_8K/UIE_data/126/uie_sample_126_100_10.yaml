initial_prompt: I want to visualize the housing prices in California using a Choropleth
  map. The map should highlight different regions based on the median house value.
  Use latitude and longitude to plot the locations, and use the color gradient to
  represent the range of median house values across different areas. The map should
  also consider ocean proximity as a factor. This way, I can see how housing prices
  vary geographically and in relation to the coast. Letâ€™s make sure that the missing
  data for total bedrooms is handled properly in the visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing the range of
  median house values?

  2. What range of colors would you like to use for highlighting different regions
  based on housing prices?

  3. Do you have a specific map style or theme preference (e.g., satellite, terrain,
  streets)?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations on the map (e.g.,
  city names, coastal areas)?

  5. How would you prefer the missing data for ''total bedrooms'' to be handled (e.g.,
  fill with median value, remove those points, etc.)?

  6. Are there any additional factors or layers you would like to include on the map
  (e.g., points of interest, transportation lines)?

  7. Do you have a specific threshold or benchmark value for median house values to
  highlight on the map?

  8. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color gradient and its correlation
  to the median house values?

  9. Is there a specific geographical scale you want to focus on (e.g., county level,
  city level)?

  10. Do you have a preferred layout for displaying the map and legend (e.g., side
  by side, legend below the map)?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure about the range of colors.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, I would like to include city names.

  5. Fill with median value would be fine.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a specific threshold in mind.

  8. Yes, please include a legend.

  9. County level would be ideal.

  10. I have no specific preference.'
