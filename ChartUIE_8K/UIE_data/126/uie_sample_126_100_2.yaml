initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing California housing prices based on geographic
  data. Show data correlations between ‘longitude’, ‘latitude’, and ‘median_house_value’.
  Annotate key high-value areas to draw attention. Highlight regions of high property
  value with distinct colors for better visual clarity. The visualization aims to
  assist in understanding real estate trends, highlighting price variations based
  on location, and providing actionable insights for potential investors.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Are there specific geographic boundaries or regions of California you want to
  focus on?

  3. How would you like the high-value areas to be annotated (e.g., with symbols,
  labels, or tooltips)?

  4. Do you prefer any particular scaling method for property values (e.g., linear,
  logarithmic)?

  5. Would you like to include any additional geographic features, such as city names
  or major highways, for context?

  6. How many distinct color ranges would you prefer for highlighting property values?

  7. Is there a specific color you associate with high-value properties that you would
  like us to use?

  8. Would you like the median housing values represented with numeric labels on the
  heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap show a gradient or distinct blocks of color for different
  value ranges?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Labels would be best.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Including city names would be helpful.

  6. I would prefer around 5 distinct color ranges.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include numeric labels for median housing values.

  9. A gradient would be better for visualizing the variations.
