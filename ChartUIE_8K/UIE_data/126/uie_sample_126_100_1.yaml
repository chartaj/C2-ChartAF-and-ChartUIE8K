initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize California housing prices with
  bubble sizes representing the total number of rooms. Use color highlights to distinguish
  different median house values. Include text annotations for key data points, especially
  those with extreme median incomes or house values to draw attention. This will help
  in focusing on specific housing trends and real estate market conditions. Ensure
  the latitude and longitude are represented correctly to show geographic distribution.
  Utilize the 'ocean_proximity' to add contextual relevance about location convenience.
  This visualization caters to real-estate market analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting different median
  house values?

  2. What specific key data points would you like to see annotated? For example, should
  we focus on the top 5% of median incomes or median house values?

  3. How would you prefer the text annotations to be formatted? Should they include
  specific details like exact values or just identifiers?

  4. Is there a specific geographical area within California you would like to emphasize
  or focus on?

  5. Do you have any preference for how ''ocean_proximity'' should be visually represented
  (e.g., different symbols or background shading)?

  6. Should the size of the bubbles be scaled linearly or logarithmically to represent
  the total number of rooms?

  7. Are there any additional data attributes or variables you would like to include
  in the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, but please choose a color scheme that emphasizes distinctions
  clearly.

  2. Please focus on the top 5% of median house values and median incomes for annotation.

  3. I would prefer text annotations to include specific details like exact values.

  4. I do not have a specific geographical area in mind.

  5. I am not sure, perhaps different symbols for ''ocean_proximity'' might work.

  6. I do not know, maybe linear scaling would be fine.

  7. No additional data attributes or variables needed.'
