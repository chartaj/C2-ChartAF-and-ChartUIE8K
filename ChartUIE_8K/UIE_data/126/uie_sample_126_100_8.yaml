initial_prompt: Create a line chart using the data from the California Housing Prices
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the 'housing_median_age' and the y-axis should
  represent the 'median_house_value'. Display the trend over different housing ages.
  Include separate lines for each category of 'ocean_proximity' to compare how proximity
  to the ocean affects median house prices across different housing ages. Make sure
  to handle missing values in 'total_bedrooms' appropriately. Include a legend for
  the different ocean proximity categories. Keep the chart clear and labeled.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the different 'ocean_proximity'\
  \ categories?\n2. How would you like missing values in 'total_bedrooms' to be handled\
  \ (e.g., imputation, removal)?\n3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better\
  \ readability?\n4. Should we include data labels on the line chart for specific\
  \ data points?\n5. Do you have a preferred style or format for the legend?\n6. Do\
  \ you have a preference for the line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for each 'ocean_proximity'\
  \ category?\n7. What font style and size would you like for the chart labels and\
  \ legend?\n8. Do you want to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it\
  \ be?\n9. Do you have any preferences for the axis scales (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?\
  \ \n10. Would you like to include any annotations or markers for key points or trends\
  \ on the chart?"
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme for the different ''ocean_proximity''
  categories.

  2. Please handle missing values in ''total_bedrooms'' through imputation.

  3. Yes, I would like gridlines on the chart for better readability.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the legend style or format.

  6. I do not know; any clear distinction in line styles will work.

  7. I am not sure; any readable font style and size will do.

  8. Yes, please include a title for the chart: "Median House Values by Housing Age
  and Ocean Proximity in California".

  9. I do not have a preference for the axis scales.

  10. I do not know.'
