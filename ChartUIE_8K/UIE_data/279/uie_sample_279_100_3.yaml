initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart visualizing the calorie content (kcal.per.g)
  and percentage of fat, protein, and lactose (perc.fat, perc.protein, perc.lactose)
  for each species of primates. The x-axis should represent the species, and the y-axis
  should show the nutritional values. Please use different colors to represent fat,
  protein, and lactose for easy differentiation. Make sure to include a legend and
  labels for clarity. This will help us understand the nutritional composition of
  primate milk in relation to brain size and evolution.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color palette to represent fat, protein,
  and lactose?

  2. Do you want any specific font style or size for the labels and legend?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should there be any specific order for the species on the x-axis?

  5. Do you prefer any specific title for the chart?

  6. Do you want data values to be displayed on the columns for kcal per g and percentages?

  7. Is there a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top, bottom, right,
  left)?

  8. Should there be any annotations or additional information included on the chart?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels or units?'
