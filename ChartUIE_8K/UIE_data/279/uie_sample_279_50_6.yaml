initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the relationship between different primate
  species and the nutritional composition of their milk (kcal per g, fat, protein,
  lactose). Highlight missing values in the neocortex percentage column.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. Should the chart include a specific color to highlight the missing values in
  the neocortex percentage column?

  3. Would you like the heatmap to include labels for the axes?

  4. Do you prefer a specific sorting order for the species in the heatmap (e.g.,
  alphabetical, evolutionary)?

  5. Would you like a legend to be included for the nutritional composition values?

  6. Should the heatmap include grid lines or separators between cells?

  7. Do you have any preferences on the font style or size for annotations and labels
  in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  3. Yes, please include labels for the axes.

  4. I am not sure.
