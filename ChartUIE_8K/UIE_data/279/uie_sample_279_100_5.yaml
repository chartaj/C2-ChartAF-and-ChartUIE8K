initial_prompt: I need a histogram to visualize the distribution of neocortex percentage
  among the different primate species. Please make sure to deal with the missing values
  in the data set properly. Also, while you are at it, could you highlight the results
  based on the clade (Strepsirrhine or others)? I'm curious to see if there is any
  noticeable difference in brain size relative to milk composition among various primate
  species.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the different
  clades in the histogram?

  2. How would you like to handle the missing values for ''neocortex.perc'' (e.g.,
  imputation, omission)?

  3. Would you prefer the histogram to have a specific bin width or bin count?

  4. Do you have a specific title or label preferences for the axes?

  5. Should the histogram include a legend to differentiate between clades?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer imputation for the missing values.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I have no specific preference.

  5. Yes, the histogram should include a legend to differentiate between clades.

  6. I am not sure.'
