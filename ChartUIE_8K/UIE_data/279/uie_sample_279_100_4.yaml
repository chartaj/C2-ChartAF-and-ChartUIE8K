initial_prompt: I'd like a pie chart visualizing the percentage composition of fat,
  protein, and lactose in primate milk. Please use the data from the species listed
  in your dataset. Each segment of the pie chart should represent the average percentage
  of fat, protein, and lactose across all species. The chart title should be "Composition
  of Primate Milk". Label each pie segment clearly with the nutrient it represents
  (Fat, Protein, Lactose). This will help compare the nutritional breakdown of milk
  among different primate species. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the segments representing
  fat, protein, and lactose?

  2. Would you like any additional text or annotations on the chart besides the labels
  for each segment and the chart title?

  3. Do you prefer the segments to be displayed in a particular order (e.g., clockwise
  starting with fat)?

  4. Would you like to include the exact percentage values on the segments of the
  pie chart or just the nutrient labels?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like to include the exact percentage values on the segments.

  5. I have no specific preference.'
