initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to compare the distribution of fat, protein,
  and lactose percentages in the milk of different primate species. Highlight the
  differences within the "Strepsirrhine" clade. Use the columns 'perc.fat', 'perc.protein',
  and 'perc.lactose'. Show individual species as data points and add labels for clarity.
  Highlight outliers, if any.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the "Strepsirrhine"
  clade?

  2. Would you like the outliers to be marked with a specific symbol or color?

  3. How would you like the individual species data points to be represented (e.g.,
  dots, triangles)?

  4. Do you have any preference for the orientation of the labels (e.g., horizontal,
  vertical, angled)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the labels and axis
  titles?

  6. Would you like any specific gridlines or axis scales to be emphasized?

  7. Should the box chart include any additional summary statistics (e.g., mean, median)
  as lines or annotations?

  8. Do you prefer any particular ordering for the species on the x-axis?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like the outliers to be marked with a specific symbol or color.

  3. I would like the individual species data points to be represented as dots.

  4. I have no specific preference for the orientation of the labels.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Yes, please include the median as a line.

  8. I have no specific preference for the ordering of the species on the x-axis.'
