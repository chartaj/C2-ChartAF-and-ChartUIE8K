initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing the relationship between 'mass'
  and 'neocortex.perc' of different primate species. Highlight species in the Strepsirrhine
  clade with a different color. Use data-driven text annotations to display the mass
  and neocortex.perc values for these highlighted points. The purpose of this visualization
  is to explore if there's any correlation between the brain size and body mass among
  various primates, particularly focusing on the Strepsirrhine clade. This visualization
  should help in studying relationships in primate biology regarding brain and body
  size.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the Strepsirrhine
  clade?

  2. What color would you like for the other primate species?

  3. How would you prefer the data-driven text annotations to be formatted?

  4. Should the text annotations include species names along with the mass and neocortex.perc
  values?

  5. Do you want gridlines on the scatter plot for better readability?

  6. Would you like to include a legend indicating the color coding for the Strepsirrhine
  clade and other species?

  7. Do you have a preference for the marker style and size for both highlighted and
  non-highlighted species?

  8. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or titles other than ''mass''
  and ''neocortex.perc''?

  9. Do you want to display the correlation coefficient on the plot?

  10. Is there any specific range or scale you would prefer for the axes?'
