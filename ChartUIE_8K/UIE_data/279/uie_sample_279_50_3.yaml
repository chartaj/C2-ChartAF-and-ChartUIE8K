initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart visualizing the percentage of fat, protein,
  and lactose in the milk of different primate species. Label the x-axis with species
  names and the y-axis with percentage values.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for each component (fat, protein,
  lactose) in the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you prefer to display values directly on the bars for exact percentages?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to clarify which color corresponds to which
  component?

  4. Do you have a preference for the chart title or should it be auto-generated based
  on the data?

  5. Is there a specific order you would like the species to be displayed on the x-axis
  (e.g., alphabetical order, by percentage of fat, protein, or lactose)?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for easier comparison of percentages between
  species?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and legend?

  8. Would you like to include error bars or confidence intervals if the data provides
  such metrics?

  9. Do you want to adjust the spacing between the bars for visual clarity?

  10. Is there a preferred orientation for the x-axis labels (e.g., horizontal, vertical,
  or angled)?
