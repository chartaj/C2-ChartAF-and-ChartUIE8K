2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a spline chart using the given data to plot 'x' versus 'y'. Highlight specific
  points where 'x' is at -1.0, -0.99, and -0.98 to emphasize their corresponding 'y'
  values prominently. Use data-driven text annotations to display these 'y' values.
  This visualization aims to focus on the relationship between 'x' and 'y' and highlight
  specific points for deeper analysis. Ensure the chart is visually appealing with
  clear distinctions for the highlighted data points and annotations, serving both
  analytical and presentational purposes.
