initial_prompt: Create a spline chart using the given data to plot 'x' versus 'y'.
  Highlight specific points where 'x' is at -1.0, -0.99, and -0.98 to emphasize their
  corresponding 'y' values prominently. Use data-driven text annotations to display
  these 'y' values. This visualization aims to focus on the relationship between 'x'
  and 'y' and highlight specific points for deeper analysis. Ensure the chart is visually
  appealing with clear distinctions for the highlighted data points and annotations,
  serving both analytical and presentational purposes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the chart?

  2. Is there a specific style or design you want for the spline curve (e.g., dashed,
  dotted, or solid lines)?

  3. How would you like the highlighted data points to be marked (e.g., different
  color, larger size, different shape)?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you have a preference for the background color or grid line style of the chart?

  6. Should there be any specific labels or titles for the axes, chart title, or legend?

  7. Would you like any additional markers or reference lines (e.g., average line,
  trendline) on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the placement of text annotations (e.g., above,
  below, or next to the highlighted points)?

  9. Is there a particular format for the display of ''y'' values in the annotations
  (e.g., decimal places, scientific notation)?

  10. Should there be any padding or spacing adjustments for better readability of
  the chart?'

  \ size would be great.\n4. I do not know. \n5. I am not sure.\n6. Labels for the\
