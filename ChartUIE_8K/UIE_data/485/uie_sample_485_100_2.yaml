initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the provided data where `x` is on the
  horizontal axis and `y` is on the vertical axis. Annotate select data points to
  highlight interesting values and add visual highlights to emphasize significant
  trends or clusters. This visualization will help in understanding the relationship
  between the variables and pinpoint areas that might need further investigation.
  The scatter plot should provide a clear and immediate insight into the data distribution
  and any correlations between `x` and `y`.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or theme for the scatter plot?

  2. Are there specific data points you would like to annotate or highlight?

  3. What criteria should be used to determine significant trends or clusters?

  4. Do you prefer certain types of markers or shapes for the data points?

  5. Should the scatter plot include gridlines or a background pattern?

  6. How would you like the axes to be labeled, including any specific units or scales?

  7. Would you prefer a legend to be included in the scatter plot? If so, where should
  it be positioned?

  8. Is there a particular font or style you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  9. Do you have any specific requirements for the size or aspect ratio of the scatter
  plot?

  10. Should reference lines (e.g., mean, median) be included on the scatter plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure, maybe use clustering algorithms?

  4. I do not know.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Label them as `x` and `y`, no specific units or scales needed.

  7. I am not sure, maybe include one if it helps.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. I do not know.

  10. Yes, include reference lines for mean.'
