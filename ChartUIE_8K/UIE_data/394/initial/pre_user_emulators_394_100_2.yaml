  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

- "Create a network diagram to visualize business relationships within the company.\
  \ Use nodes to represent individuals (e.g., company.CEO.JohnSmith) and connections\
  \ to show their imports (e.g., company.CFO.SarahJohnson). Add data-driven text annotations\
  \ to highlight key relationships, such as the CEO\u2019s direct imports. Use highlights\
  \ to emphasize higher-level roles, making them more visually distinct. This will\
  \ help focus on key personnel and their influence within the network. The purpose\
  \ is to easily identify communication patterns and hierarchical structures within\
  \ the company. Ensure all annotations and highlights serve to clarify these relationships."
