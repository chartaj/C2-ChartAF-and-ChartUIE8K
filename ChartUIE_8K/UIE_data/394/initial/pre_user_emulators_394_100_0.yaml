2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Imagine a radar chart showcasing relationships and sizes among company employees.
  Focus on highlighting the primary roles such as CEO, CFO, and finance managers.
  Use text annotations to display names and sizes, directing attention to key individuals
  like John Smith, Sarah Johnson, and Alice Davis. The purpose is to visualize key
  business relationships within the company, illustrating interconnected roles. Non-essential
  employees can be highlighted less prominently. Remember, the aim is to provide context
  and orientation to the viewer, emphasizing connections to support organizational
  understanding and strategic planning. Use colors and labels effectively.
