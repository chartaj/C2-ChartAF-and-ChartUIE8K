initial_prompt: I need a bar chart that shows the sizes of different company positions.
  For instance, compare the number of people in various departments like CEO, CFO,
  finance managers, etc. The data seems detailed, and it's great for showing how big
  each role/team is within the company. You can use the "size" values for the bar
  lengths, and the "name" values to label each bar. This will help in visualizing
  the distribution of personnel across different roles. Include every unique role
  listed in the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. Should the bars be displayed vertically or horizontally?

  3. Would you like to include values on top of each bar?

  4. Is there a specific order in which you want the roles to be displayed (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by size)?

  5. Do you need any specific labels or annotations on the chart?

  6. Would you like to include a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If so, what
  should it be?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the labels and titles?

  8. Would you like the chart to include a legend?

  9. Do you prefer a specific style for the bars (e.g., solid, patterned)?

  10. Should the chart include gridlines? If yes, at what intervals?'
