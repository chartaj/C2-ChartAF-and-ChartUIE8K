initial_prompt: Create a table chart to visualize the company hierarchy data. Include
  columns for 'name', 'size', and 'imports' to show relationships between different
  company roles. Annotate the data-driven elements to highlight key roles like CEO,
  CFO, and finance managers. Use highlights to emphasize important positions and relationships
  within the company. The visualization aims to provide clarity on the structure and
  connectivity within the company's business operations, focusing the viewer's attention
  on specific roles before examining others. Provide text annotations for additional
  context and orientation regarding each role's significance.

  chart?

  5. Do you have a preferred order for the columns ''name'', ''size'', and ''imports''?

  6. Are there specific visual indicators you prefer for highlighting key roles?

  7. Should the table chart include any sort of grouping or categorization within
  the roles?

  8. Would you like the relationships between roles to be represented in another form

  hierarchy levels?

  context for each role?'
