  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to distinguish
  different types of connections (direct reports, peer relationships, higher management
  links)?

  2. What should be the order of roles on the x-axis? Alphabetical or based on size?

  3. Should the chart include labels displaying the exact size and number of connections
  for each role?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style and size for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or notes in the chart to highlight
  specific roles or connections?

  6. Is there a need for a legend to explain the colors used for different types of
  connections, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Should the chart include grids or background lines to enhance readability?

  8. Do you prefer the bars to be separated by small gaps or closely stacked together
