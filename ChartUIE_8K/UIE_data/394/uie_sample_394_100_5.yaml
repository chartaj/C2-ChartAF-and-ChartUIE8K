initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart that shows the size of each unique
  company role and their connections (imports) with other roles. The chart should
  have each unique role on the x-axis, the size of each role on the y-axis, and different
  colors to indicate the number and types of connections each role has. Ensure to
  differentiate between direct reports, peer relationships, and higher management
  links distinctly. This will help in visually understanding the company structure
  and relationships effectively. Thank you.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette to distinguish different
  types of connections (direct reports, peer relationships, higher management links)?

  2. What should be the order of roles on the x-axis? Alphabetical or based on size?

  3. Should the chart include labels displaying the exact size and number of connections
  for each role?

  4. Do you prefer any specific font style and size for the axis labels and chart
  title?

  5. Would you like to include any annotations or notes in the chart to highlight
  specific roles or connections?

  6. Is there a need for a legend to explain the colors used for different types of
  connections, and if so, where should it be placed?

  7. Should the chart include grids or background lines to enhance readability?

  8. Do you prefer the bars to be separated by small gaps or closely stacked together
  without gaps?

  9. Are there specific dimensions or aspect ratios you prefer for the chart?'
