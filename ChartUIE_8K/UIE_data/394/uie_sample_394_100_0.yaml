initial_prompt: Imagine a radar chart showcasing relationships and sizes among company
  employees. Focus on highlighting the primary roles such as CEO, CFO, and finance
  managers. Use text annotations to display names and sizes, directing attention to
  key individuals like John Smith, Sarah Johnson, and Alice Davis. The purpose is
