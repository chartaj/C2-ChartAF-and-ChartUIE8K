initial_prompt: Please create a tree map visualizing company roles and hierarchy based
  on the provided dataset. Each block should represent an individualâ€™s name (e.g.,
  company.CEO.JohnSmith) as part of the company structure. The size of each block
  should correspond to the 'size' attribute, and each block should also show connections
  (imports) to visualize relationships/hierarchies within the organization. Include
  subcategories like CEO, CFO, etc., to accurately depict the business structure as
  per company relationships. Looking for a clear, detailed representation that outlines
  how roles interact and hierarchy flows in the business.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences regarding the color scheme for different
  roles or hierarchical levels?

  2. How would you like the subcategories such as CEO, CFO, etc., to be labeled or
  distinguished within the tree map?

  3. Should the thickness or style of the connections (imports) indicating relationships
  be differentiated in any specific way?

  4. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the names displayed within
  each block?

  5. Are there any specific details or annotations that you prefer to be included
  in the tree map for clarity?

  6. Would you like to incorporate any additional legends or keys to explain the visual
  elements in the tree map?

  7. Do you have a preference for how detailed or simplified the hierarchical connections
  should be displayed?'
