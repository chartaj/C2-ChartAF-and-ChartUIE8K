initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the unique words used by different
  rappers over time. Use data from the file '../Extra_datas/data/428.csv'. The x-axis
  should represent different eras (e.g., 1990s, 2010s), and the y-axis should show
  the number of unique words. Each line should represent a different rapper. Ensure
  the chart allows us to compare the linguistic diversity of various rappers across
  different eras. Highlight any missing data points or trends where unique word usage
  changes significantly. This will help analyze linguistic evolution in rap over the
  decades.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the specific color scheme or palette
  for the lines representing different rappers?

  2. Would you like to have gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should data points be marked with specific markers for clarity when highlighting
  trends and missing data points?

  4. Would you prefer any particular font style or size for the labels and legends?

  5. Do you have a preferred format for displaying missing data points, such as dotted
  lines or gaps?

  6. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, what should
  they be?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if yes, where should it be positioned
  (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the tick interval on the x-axis (eras) or y-axis
  (unique words)?

  9. Would you like to annotate significant changes or trends in the data directly
  on the chart? If so, any particular style for annotations?

  10. Should the axes labels be rotated for better readability?'
