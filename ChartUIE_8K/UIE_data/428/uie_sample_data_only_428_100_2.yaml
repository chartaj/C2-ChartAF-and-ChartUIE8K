07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between
  the 1990s and 2010s?

  2. What style of text annotations would you prefer for highlighting the average
  number of words per rapper and significant outliers? (e.g., font size, font type)

  3. Is there a specific layout or orientation you prefer for the histogram (e.g.,
  vertical bars, horizontal bars)?

  4. How detailed do you want the brief summary context to be? Should it include specific
  examples, historical context, or just a general overview?

  5. Do you have a preference for the histogram bin width or specific ranges of unique
  words?

  6. Would you like any additional statistical measures besides the average (e.g.,
  median, mode) displayed on the chart?
