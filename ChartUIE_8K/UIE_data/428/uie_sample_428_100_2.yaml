initial_prompt: I have a dataset focusing on unique words used by different rappers
  across various eras. The columns cover data like 'notes', 'recalc', 'era', 'rapper',
  'color', 'words', 'id', and 'source'. I'd like to visualize the distribution of
  unique words by different rappers using a pie chart. The chart should highlight
  the proportion of each rapper's use of unique words. Utilize the 'rapper' and 'words'
  columns to create this visualization. Additionally, display the data in a manner
  that allows me to see differences between rappers clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the pie chart?

  2. Do you want to include labels or annotations on each pie slice to show the percentage
  or count of unique words?

  3. Should the chart include a legend to identify each rapper by name?

  4. Do you prefer any particular ordering of the pie slices, such as by the number
  of unique words or alphabetically by rapper names?

  5. Would you like to incorporate any specific fonts or styling for the text labels?

  6. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the pie chart?

  7. Would you like to include any additional visual elements, such as borders or
  shadows, to highlight the pie slices?

  8. Are there any specific data ranges or outliers you want to be emphasized or excluded
  in the visualization?'
