initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the unique word counts used by
  different rappers over various eras. Utilize the 'recalc' as the x-axis representing
  some numeric values related to words, and 'words' on the y-axis to represent unique
  word counts. Each point on the scatter plot should symbolize a rapper, with the
  color of the points representing the 'color' column (if available) to distinguish
  different genres or styles. Ensure to handle missing values appropriately, either
  by ignoring them or using a default value. Title the chart "Unique Words by Rappers
  Over Time".
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the points representing different
  genres or styles?

  2. How would you prefer to handle missing values for ''recalc'' and ''words''? Should
  they be ignored or replaced with a default value?

  3. Would you like to see any specific gridlines or axis ticks on the chart?

  4. Is there a specific format you prefer for the ''words'' numeric values (e.g.,
  comma-separated)?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart title, axis labels,
  and legend?

  6. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to include on the
  scatter plot?'
