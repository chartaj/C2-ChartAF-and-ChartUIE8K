initial_prompt: Create a diverging bar chart to visualize the cost overruns of various
  government projects. Use the data provided to compare Planned and Actual costs for
  each project. Highlight each project name prominently. Please ensure the chart shows
  both the positive (cost savings, if any) and negative (cost overruns) deviations.
  The projects to include are Elbphilharmonie, Electronic Health Insurance Card, and
  Flughafen Berlin. Make sure the costs are displayed in millions of Euros, with clearly
  labeled axes and color-coded bars for planned versus actual costs.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme for the bars, specifically
  for planned vs actual costs?

  2. Should the project names be bolded or formatted in any specific way for better
  visibility?

  3. Would you like any specific fonts or styles for the labels and titles?

  4. Do you prefer the chart to have gridlines or not?

  5. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include to
  emphasize specific data points?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between planned and actual costs?

  7. Are there any specific sizes or dimensions you prefer for the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the order in which the projects are displayed
  (e.g., by alphabetical order, by magnitude of cost overrun)?

  9. Would you like to include any reference lines or benchmarks in the chart?

  10. Do you want to add any interactive elements such as tooltips or labels that
  appear on hover for additional details?'
