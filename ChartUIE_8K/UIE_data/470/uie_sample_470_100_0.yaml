initial_prompt: Create a table chart to compare planned and actual costs of various
  government projects. Highlight the projects where actual costs significantly exceeded
  planned costs to emphasize budget overruns. Use text annotations to display the
  specific cost values, and provide a brief description of each project for context.
  The goal is to highlight inefficiencies in budgeting and project management for
  public awareness and scrutiny. Ensure the table is easy to read and visually emphasizes
  the most problematic over-budget projects. Include a note that offers additional
  insights or comments on the data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting budget overruns
  in the table chart?

  2. How would you prefer the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color,
  bold)?

  3. Do you want any specific symbols or indicators (e.g., arrows, icons) next to
  projects with significant budget overruns?

  4. Should the table include any sorting or grouping options (e.g., sorting by the
  magnitude of cost overrun)?

  5. Are there any additional columns or data attributes you would like to add to
  the table?

  6. Is there a specific layout or design style you prefer for the table (e.g., grid
  lines, alternating row colors)?

  7. How detailed should the project descriptions be, and do you have a preferred
  format for these descriptions?

  8. Would you like the note offering additional insights or comments on the data
  to be positioned in a specific location within the chart?'
