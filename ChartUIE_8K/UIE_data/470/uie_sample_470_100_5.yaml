initial_prompt: 'I would like a bar chart visualizing the cost overruns of various
  government projects. The X-axis should list the projects: Elbphilharmonie, Electronic
  Health Insurance Card, and Flughafen Berlin. The Y-axis should show costs in billions
  of Euros. For each project, display two bars side by side: one for planned costs
  and one for actual costs, using different colors for each. Ensure labels and a legend
  are included for clarity. This chart should help highlight the budget discrepancies
  and monitor spending in future projects. Thanks!'

  between planned and actual costs?
