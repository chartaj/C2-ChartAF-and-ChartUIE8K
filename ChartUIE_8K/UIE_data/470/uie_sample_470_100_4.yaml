initial_prompt: Please create a visually appealing stacked column chart that compares
  planned vs actual costs for various government projects. Use the data provided in
  the CSV file. For each project, show both the planned costs and the actual costs
  stacked on top of each other. Ensure all project names and cost details are clearly
  visible. Highlight the cost overrun for better clarity. The chart should be easily
  understandable, with a legend explaining the columns. Make sure the chart is suitable
  for a presentation on government project budget management.
