initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart showing "Planned costs" vs. "Actual costs"
  for different projects. Highlight the significant project cost overruns with annotations
  to emphasize differences. Include annotations to highlight key figures showing planned
  vs. actual costs to draw attention to the discrepancies. Make sure to use different

  extent of budget overruns and understand the fiscal impact on government expenditure.
