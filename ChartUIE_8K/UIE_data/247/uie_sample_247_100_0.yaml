initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the CpG values of smoking
  and non-smoking patients. The x-axis should represent different CpG sites like cg00050873,
  cg00212031, etc., and the y-axis should show the corresponding CpG values. Each
  column should be divided into segments based on "Smoking Status" (current, former,
  never, etc.). Use annotations to highlight the highest and lowest CpG values for
  each site, emphasizing smoking status differences. The chart should make it easier
  to compare CpG methylation levels between smokers and non-smokers. Highlight key
  differences using different colors for each smoking status.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each smoking status
  (e.g., current, former, never)?

  2. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and annotations?

  3. Do you want the highest and lowest CpG values to be annotated with a particular
  format or style?

  4. Would you like to include a legend explaining the colors for each smoking status?
  If so, where should it be placed?

  5. Are there any specific ranges or values you would like to highlight on the y-axis?

  6. Do you have a preference for the order in which the smoking statuses are stacked
  in each column?

  7. Is there a specific orientation (horizontal or vertical) you prefer for the x-axis
  labels?

  8. Would you like gridlines on the chart to enhance readability? If so, which axis
  should include them?

  9. Should there be any margin or spacing between the stacked segments in each column?

  10. Do you have any specific title or subtitle you would like to add to the chart?
  If so, please specify.'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please use bold font and a contrasting color for the annotations of the
  highest and lowest CpG values.

  4. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed.

  5. No specific ranges or values to highlight.

  6. I have no specific preference.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include gridlines on both axes.

  9. I do not know.
