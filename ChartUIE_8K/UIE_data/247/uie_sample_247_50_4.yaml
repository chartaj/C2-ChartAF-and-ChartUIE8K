initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing average CpG values between smoking status
  categories (current, non-smoker, former) for selected cg-sites (cg00050873, cg00212031,
  cg00213748). Make sure bars are grouped by smoking status and colored differently.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for different
  smoking status categories (e.g., specific colors for current, non-smoker, former)?

  2. Would you like to include error bars to represent variability in CpG values within
  each smoking status category?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the categories of smoking status on the
  x-axis?

  4. Should the y-axis be labeled with raw CpG values or should it include units or
  a descriptive label?

  5. Do you have a preferred title for the bar chart?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the bar chart?

  7. Do you want to display the exact numeric values of the bars on the chart?

  8. Are there specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the labels and title?

  9. Should the legend be positioned in a specific location on the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the aspect ratio or dimensions of the
  bar chart?'
