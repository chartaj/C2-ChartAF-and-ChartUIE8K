initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing the beta values of different CpG sites
  for three smoking patients. Plot ‘Age’ on the x-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing different
  CpG sites?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between the different CpG
  sites? If so, where should it be placed?

  3. Do you prefer any specific line styles (e.g., solid, dashed) for the different
  CpG sites?

  4. Should there be markers on the lines to denote specific data points?

  5. Would you like to include a grid for better readability? If yes, do you prefer
  a grid for both x and y axes or just one of them?

  6. Are there any specific CpG sites you want to highlight more prominently in the
  chart?

  7. Do you have a preferred font and size for the axis labels and title?

  8. Would you like the x-axis to have specific intervals or ticks representing the
  age?

  9. Should the y-axis have a specific range, or should it auto-adjust based on the
  data values?

  10. Do you need titles for the x-axis (''Age'') and y-axis (e.g., ''Beta Values'')?

  11. Would you like to include any annotations or reference lines in the chart to
  emphasize certain data points or trends?'
