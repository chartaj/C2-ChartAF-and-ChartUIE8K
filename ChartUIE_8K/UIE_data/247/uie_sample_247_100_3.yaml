initial_prompt: I would like to see a line chart comparing the CpG values for smoking
  and non-smoking patients over different age groups. The x-axis should represent
  the different CpG sites (like cg00050873, cg00212031, etc.), and the y-axis should
  represent the average CpG value. Use different lines to distinguish between smoking
  status (current, former, never) and genders (male, female). This will help highlight
  any potential differences in DNA methylation patterns between smokers and non-smokers
  and between different genders and ages.
questions: "1. What color scheme would you prefer for distinguishing the different\
  \ smoking statuses and genders? \n2. Do you have a preference for the line styles\
  \ (e.g., solid, dashed) for different smoking statuses and genders? \n3. Would you\
  \ like to see markers on the lines to indicate the data points for each CpG site?\
  \ \n4. How many age groups would you like to categorize, and what ranges should\
  \ they cover? \n5. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, for which axes\
  \ (x, y, or both)?\n6. Do you want to add annotations or data labels to any specific\
  \ parts of the chart?\n7. Would you like to incorporate a legend, and where should\
  \ it be positioned on the chart? \n8. Do you prefer specific font styles or sizes\
  \ for the axis labels and title?\n9. Should the chart include any reference lines\
  \ or bands to highlight specific ranges or values? \n10. Is there a specific way\
  \ you prefer the lines to be ordered or layered on the chart?"
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Solid lines for current smokers, dashed for former smokers, and dotted for never
  smokers.

  3. Yes, I would like to see markers on the lines.

  4. I am not sure, maybe three groups: 20-30, 31-50, and 51+.

  5. Yes, include gridlines for both axes.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a legend positioned at the bottom.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. No, I don''t think reference lines or bands are necessary.

  10. I do not know.'
