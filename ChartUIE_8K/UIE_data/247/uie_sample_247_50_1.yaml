initial_prompt: Visualize a box chart contrasting CpG methylation levels between smoking
  and non-smoking patients. Highlight notable discrepancies in values and add text
  annotations for key CpG sites demonstrating significant differences. Focus on genes
  impacted by smoking status for detailed insights in the final visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Would you prefer the text annotations to be placed inside the plot area or outside,
  connected by lines?

  3. Are there specific CpG sites you are most interested in highlighting?

  4. Do you have any preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear or logarithmic)?

  5. How detailed should the text annotations be for key CpG sites?

  6. Should the chart include a legend to distinguish between smoking and non-smoking
  patients, or is the color differentiation sufficient?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the chart to aid in value discernment?

  8. Do you prefer any specific font size or style for the text annotations and labels?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I would like the annotations to be fairly detailed to explain the key differences
