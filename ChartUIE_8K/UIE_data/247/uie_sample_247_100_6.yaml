initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the CpG values of smoking and non-smoking
  patients. Use GSM, Smoking Status, Gender, Age, and the CpG sites (cg00050873 to
  cg03706273) from the provided data. The heatmap should show how CpG values differ
  across different patients based on their smoking status, gender, and age. Ensure
  the heatmap is color-coded to distinguish between high and low CpG values. Include
  a legend explaining the color scheme for better interpretation. The x-axis should
  represent the different CpG sites, and the y-axis should represent individual patients
  (GSM).
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences or schemes for distinguishing
  between high and low CpG values?

  2. How should we categorize and display the smoking status, gender, and age in the
  visualization?

  3. Do you prefer a specific ordering of the patients (GSM) on the y-axis, such as
  by age or another attribute?

  4. Should we include any specific labels or annotations for certain CpG sites or
  patient groups?

  5. How detailed do you want the legend to be? Should it include all specific value
  ranges and corresponding colors?

  6. Is there a preferred way to handle missing values in the heatmap? Should they
  be visualized in a distinct way?

  7. Should we include any statistical summaries or additional data overlays, such
  as average CpG values by smoking status or gender?

  8. Are there specific aspects of the differences in CpG values that you want to
  highlight or focus on in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I prefer to see smoking status, gender, and age maybe as annotations or color
  bars beside the heatmap.

  3. I am not sure about the specific ordering of the patients.

  4. I do not have any specific labels or annotations to include.

  5. Yes, I would like the legend to include all specific value ranges and corresponding
  colors.

  6. I do not know how to handle missing values.

  7. I do not have a preference for including additional data overlays.

  8. I am not sure which aspects to highlight specifically.'
