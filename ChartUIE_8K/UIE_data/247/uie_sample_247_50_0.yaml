  and non-smoking patients?

  2. Do you have any preferred colors for highlighting specific CpG sites?

  3. How would you like the text annotations to appear? (e.g., font size, font color,
  placement)

  4. Are there specific CpG sites you want to highlight with text annotations?

  5. Do you want to include a legend to explain the segments in the stacked bar chart?

  6. Would you prefer the bars to be segmented by gender within smoking status or
  vice versa?

  7. Do you have a preference for the axis labels'' font size and style?

  8. Would you like to include error bars or variability indicators for each CpG value?

  9. Is there a specific order in which you want the CpG sites to appear on the chart?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?'
