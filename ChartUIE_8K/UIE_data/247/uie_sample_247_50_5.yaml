initial_prompt: Create a histogram comparing CpG site values for smoking status. Use
  'Smoking Status' for categories and CpG site columns like 'cg00050873', 'cg00212031',
  etc., for bin values. This helps visualize methylation differences.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different smoking status categories?

  2. Do you have a specific preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or titles on the axes?

  4. Should there be a legend indicating which color corresponds to which smoking
  status?

  5. Are there any specific CpG sites besides ''cg00050873'' and ''cg00212031'' you
  would like to include in the visualization?

  6. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the text in the chart?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Are there any particular visual highlights you want for significant methylation
  differences?

  9. Do you want to display the mean or median methylation values on the histogram?

  10. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the histogram (vertical or
  horizontal bars)?'
