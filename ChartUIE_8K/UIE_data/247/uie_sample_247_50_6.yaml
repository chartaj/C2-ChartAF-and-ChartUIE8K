initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the differences in the CpG values between
  smoking and non-smoking patients. Use the columns from the CSV file to plot "GSM"
  on the y-axis and the specific CpG sites on the x-axis, with color intensity representing
  the CpG values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. Should there be a specific range for the color intensity to represent the CpG
  values?

  3. Do you want to include labels for both the x-axis (specific CpG sites) and y-axis
  (GSM)?

  4. Should the heatmap include a legend to indicate the values corresponding to the
  color intensities?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size used in the axis labels
  and legend?

  6. Would you like to include a title or a subtitle on the heatmap? If so, what should
  it be?

  7. Are there any specific CpG sites or GSMs you would like to highlight or annotate
  in the heatmap?

  8. Do you want to apply clustering to the rows (GSMs) or columns (CpG sites) in
  the heatmap to identify patterns?

  9. Should missing values be handled in a specific way (e.g., imputed, left blank,
  or displayed with a specific color)?

  10. Is there a specific aspect ratio or size requirement for the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, please include labels for both the x-axis (specific CpG sites) and y-axis
  (GSM).

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful to indicate the values corresponding to the color
  intensities.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please add a title "CpG Value Differences in Smoking vs. Non-Smoking Patients".

  7. I do not have any specific preferences for highlighting or annotating specific
  sites.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. I do not have a specific aspect ratio or size requirement in mind.'
