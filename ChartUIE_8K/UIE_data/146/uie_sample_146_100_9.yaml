initial_prompt: I need a parallel coordinates chart to visualize the data from the
  2024 Lok Sabha Election Results in India. Each line should represent a constituency,
  showing how the Leading Candidate, Leading Party, Trailing Candidate, Trailing Party,
  and Margin compare across different constituencies. Highlight constituencies with
  a large margin as it shows the winner's dominance. Also, display status for easy
  understanding of the outcome in each case. This visualization will help in comparing
  trends and margins between different political parties and their candidates. Make
  sure to label the axes clearly for easy interpretation.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting constituencies
  with a large margin?

  2. How would you like the margins to be categorized as "large"?

  3. Should each party be represented by specific colors or patterns for better distinction?

  4. Do you have preferences for the orientation and organization of the axes?

  5. Would you like any additional labels or annotations on the chart for key constituencies
  or notable results?

  6. Is there a preferred order of attributes on the axes to better visualize the
  trends and comparisons?

  7. Should any specific constituencies be highlighted or emphasized differently apart
  from those with a large margin?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. A margin above 20,000 votes can be categorized as "large".

  3. Yes, each party should be represented by specific colors for better distinction.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I have no specific preference.
