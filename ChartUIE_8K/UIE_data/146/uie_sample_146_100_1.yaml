initial_prompt: Create a step line chart to visualize the leading and trailing candidates
  in each constituency from the 2024 Lok Sabha Election Results. Annotate the margins
  where notable changes occur and highlight constituencies where the Bharatiya Janata
  Party or Indian National Congress are leading. The chart should help understand
  election trends and party performance across constituencies. Include both the candidate
  names and party affiliations in the annotations to provide clear insights into the
  political landscape. Ensure the chart focuses on significant changes and results
  declared for better analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the step line chart,
  especially for distinguishing between different parties?

  2. How would you like the margins to be annotated? (e.g., with text boxes, lines,
  or other markers)

  3. Should there be a specific highlight style for the constituencies where the Bharatiya
  Janata Party and Indian National Congress are leading?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the candidate names and party affiliations
  in the annotations?

  5. Would you like gridlines or background shading to be included in the chart for
  better readability?

  6. Are there specific thresholds for what constitutes ''notable changes'' in the
  margins that should be annotated?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the legend placement or other chart elements
  (e.g., title, axis labels)?

  8. Should the chart display all constituencies or only those with significant changes
  and results declared?

  9. Do you have a preferred order for the constituencies to be displayed (e.g., by
  geographic region, alphabetical order, margin size)?'
