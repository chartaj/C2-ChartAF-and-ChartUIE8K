initial_prompt: Create a line chart showing vehicle counts over time for each junction.
  Highlight peak times with color changes. Add text annotations for specific high
  traffic points to draw attention. The practical purpose is to analyze traffic patterns
  and predict congestion.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting peak times?

  2. What specific text annotations would you like for the high traffic points?

  3. Do you prefer a specific line style (e.g., solid, dashed) for different junctions?

  4. Should there be a legend to distinguish different junctions?

  5. Is there a preferred time interval for the x-axis (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly)?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  7. Should the chart include a title and axis labels? If yes, please provide the
  preferred titles and labels.

  8. Would you like to see a trend line or moving average added to the data?

  9. Is there a specific font or size preference for the annotations and labels?

  10. Should the chart display data points along with the line for each junction?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe indicate the time and vehicle count for high traffic
  points.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, a legend to distinguish different junctions would be helpful.

  5. I do not know, maybe hourly for more detail.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be good for better readability.

  7. Title: "Vehicle Counts Over Time for Each Junction", x-axis: "Time", y-axis:
  "Vehicle Count".

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure, but if it helps with clarity, then yes.'
