initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to traffic prediction. The dataset includes
  columns for DateTime, Junction, Vehicles, and ID. Could you please create a scatter
  plot chart from this data? I want to visualize the number of vehicles passing through
  different junctions over time. Please ensure that the DateTime is on the x-axis,
  the number of Vehicles is on the y-axis, and use different colors to represent different
  junctions. This should help in identifying traffic patterns at various junctions.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for representing different junctions?

  2. What time intervals would you like the DateTime axis to display (e.g., hourly,
  daily, weekly)?

  3. Would you like to include grid lines or any specific axis formatting?

  4. Do you want any specific markers or shapes for the scatter plot points?

  5. Should the chart include a title or any specific labels for the axes?

  6. Are there any specific thresholds or reference lines you''d like to see on the
  y-axis (Vehicles)?

  7. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the chart labels and title?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Hourly would be best.

  3. Yes, please include grid lines.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Yes, please include a title and labels for the axes.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I have no specific preference.'
