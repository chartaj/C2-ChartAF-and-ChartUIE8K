  of different subway lines in various Canadian cities, such as Vancouver and Toronto,
  from the provided dataset. Each column should represent a city, and within each
  city column, stack different subway lines. The height of each stack should represent
  the construction cost in CAD, and the color of each stack section should differentiate
