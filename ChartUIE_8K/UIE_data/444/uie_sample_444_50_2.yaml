initial_prompt: Visualize a choropleth map highlighting countries with public transit
  projects. Emphasize real costs, tunneling percentage, and station counts. Use annotations
  to show start and end years.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preference for the choropleth map to represent
  different ranges of ''real costs''?

  2. Should the colors be in a gradient scale, or would you prefer distinct color
  ranges for ''tunneling percentage''?

  3. How would you like to differentiate between start and end years in the annotations
  (e.g., different font styles, colors, or icons)?

  4. Would you prefer to see the station counts represented as numerical values or
  with symbols on the map?

  5. Do you want the annotations for start and end years to appear directly on the
  map or in a separate legend/key?

  6. Is there a preferred way for you to deal with any missing data in the visualization?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) to
  be used for the choropleth map?

  8. Are there any specific regions or countries you would like to highlight or emphasize
  more prominently on the map?

  9. Should the map include additional contextual information such as geographical
  features or city names?

  10. Do you have a preference for the tooltip design or content when a user hovers
  over a country?'
