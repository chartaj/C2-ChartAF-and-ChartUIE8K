initial_prompt: Create a dot plot showing the length of public transit lines in different
  Canadian cities, with colors representing the percentage of the lines that are tunneled.
  Plot the x-axis as city names and the y-axis as the length of the transit lines
  in kilometers. Use distinct dot colors to indicate the tunnel percentage categories
  (e.g., 0-25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-100%). Include tooltips that display the line name,
  start year, end year, and total cost in millions of CAD. This chart is for public
  transit infrastructure planning for government use.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used to
  represent the tunnel percentage categories?

  7. Would you like the chart to include a legend explaining the colors used for tunnel
  percentage categories?

  the chart?'
