initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of 'cost_km_millions'
  across different 'city' and 'line' combinations. Highlight values with significant
  deviations from the average to emphasize areas with unusually high or low construction
  costs. Use annotations to display exact figures for these outliers. This visualization
  aims to provide a clear, comparative view of transit project costs across Canadian
  cities, helping to identify potential factors influencing cost variations for informed
  governmental decision-making. Ensure the heatmap is intuitive with a color gradient
  representing cost intensity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for representing cost intensity?

  2. Are there specific colors you prefer for highlighting unusually high or low construction
  costs?

  3. How would you like the annotations for outliers to be displayed? (e.g., font
  size, color)

  4. Do you have any preferences for the positioning of annotations on the heatmap?

  5. Would you like gridlines or borders between cells to enhance readability?

  6. Is there a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  7. Do you want a specific title and/or subtitle for the heatmap?

  8. Should there be labels for the axes and, if so, any specific formatting for them?

  9. Would you like a legend to explain the color gradient, and if so, where should
  it be placed?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size for various textual
  elements in the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the preferred color gradient.

  2. I do not know; maybe use bright colors for high costs and cool colors for low
  costs.

  3. I am not sure about the specifics, just make it readable.

  4. I do not know; wherever they fit best without overcrowding the heatmap.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines or borders to enhance readability.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for size or aspect ratio.

  7. No specific title or subtitle, unless you think it would help.

  8. Yes, labels for the axes would be helpful; no specific formatting needed.

  9. Yes, a legend explaining the color gradient should be included; I trust your
  judgment for placement.

  10. I am not sure about the font style and size; just make it clear and legible.'
