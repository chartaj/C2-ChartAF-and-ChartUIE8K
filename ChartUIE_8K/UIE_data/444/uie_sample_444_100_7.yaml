initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart to compare the costs and real
  costs of different public transit infrastructure projects by city and line. Use
  "city" for the x-axis, "cost" and "real_cost" for the y-axis, and group the bars
  by "line" for each city. Ensure each bar is distinctly colored for clarity. Include
  a legend for "cost" and "real_cost" and label all axes appropriately. Use the provided
  data attributes from the datasets for accurate representation. Include tooltip details
  for each bar to show additional information like "start_year", "end_year", and "currency".
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. How would you like the data values to be displayed on the bars (e.g., inside
  the bars, on top of the bars)?

  3. Do you have a specific format in mind for the tooltips?

  4. Should the x-axis and y-axis labels include units or any specific formatting?

  5. Would you like any specific grid lines or background patterns to be included
  for better readability?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  7. Do you require any specific order for the cities and lines to be displayed?

  8. How detailed should the legend be? Should it include descriptions or just simple
  labels?

  9. Would highlighting specific data points (e.g., highest cost, lowest cost) be
  useful for your analysis?'
