initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the construction costs
  of different subway lines in various Canadian cities, such as Vancouver and Toronto,
  from the provided dataset. Each column should represent a city, and within each
  city column, stack different subway lines. The height of each stack should represent
  the construction cost in CAD, and the color of each stack section should differentiate
  the subway lines. Add labels for city names and line names. Include a legend for
  line identification, and tooltip functionality to display cost details on hover.
  Ensure the x-axis represents cities and the y-axis represents costs in millions
  of CAD.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for specific colors to represent different
  subway lines?

  2. Would you like to have grid lines in the background of the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the chart have a title? If yes, what title would you like?

  4. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the labels and legend?

  5. Would you like to include axis titles for both the x-axis and y-axis? If so,
  what should they be?

  6. Should the y-axis start at zero or another specified value?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering of the cities on the x-axis?

  8. Would you like the subway lines to be ordered by cost within each city?

  9. Do you have any preference on the padding or spacing between the city columns?

  10. Should the legend be placed in a specific position in the chart (e.g., top,
  right, bottom, left)?'
