initial_prompt: Create a line chart that visualizes the construction costs of public
  transit-infrastructure projects over time in Canada. Use the 'cost' column on the
  Y-axis and 'year' on the X-axis. Differentiate the lines by 'city' and 'line,' so
  we can compare trends in different locations and projects. Add markers for key data
  points and include a legend for clarity. Label axes and title the chart "Public
  Transit Infrastructure Costs in Canadian Cities." This will help government entities
  analyze the financial trends and cost efficiency of various public transit projects
  across different periods and regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for differentiating
  the ''city'' and ''line''?

  2. What type of markers would you like to use for key data points (e.g., circles,
  squares, triangles)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the line styles (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted) for different cities or lines?

  4. How detailed would you like the axis labels to be? Should the year be shown as
  ''YYYY''?

  5. Where would you prefer the legend to be placed (e.g., top-right, bottom-left,
  beside the chart)?

  6. Is there any specific font style or size you would like to use for the chart
  title, axis labels, or legend?

  7. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability?

  8. Is there any specific annotation or note you would like to add to the chart for
  enhanced context or explanation?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Solid lines are fine for differentiation, but I am not sure about other styles.

  4. Year as ''YYYY'' would be good.

  5. Top-right position for the legend works for me.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  7. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability.

  8. I do not have any specific annotations to add.'
