initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot for the Coffee Taste Test data. Plot "age" on
  the x-axis and "cups" on the y-axis to visualize the relationship between age groups
  and the number of cups of coffee consumed. Color code the points by "style" (e.g.,
  Complex, Light) and use different shapes for "favorite" type of coffee (e.g., Regular
  drip coffee, Iced coffee). This will help understand preferences and consumption
  patterns among different age groups and styles, aiding in market analysis for targeting
  specific demographics based on their coffee drinking habits.

  variable?

  3. Should the axes have specific ranges or limits?

  7. Should the legend be displayed in a specific location on the chart?

  8. Would you like to include data labels directly on the points?

  9. Do you have any preferences for the background color of the chart?

  10. Should the chart include a title and subtitle? If so, what should they be?'
