initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualization for the "Coffee Taste Test" dataset,
  focusing on the "favorite" coffee type among different age groups. Please break
  down the age groups and show how many participants in each group prefer each type
  of coffee (Regular drip coffee, Iced coffee, etc.). This will help me understand
  the coffee preferences across various demographics. Ensure to label the chart clearly
  with age groups on the x-axis and the count of preferences on the y-axis. This visual
  representation should provide insights into the most favored coffee types.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the bar
  chart?

  2. Would you like the bars to be grouped or stacked by coffee type within each age
  group?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the labels and title of
  the chart?

  4. Do you have a preferred order for the age groups on the x-axis (e.g., ascending/descending
  by age)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the coffee types?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or highlights on the chart?

  7. Is there a specific format for the chart title you would prefer?

  8. Do you have any custom preferences for axis labels or tick marks?

  9. Would you like to display the exact counts on top of each bar for better clarity?

  10. Are there any specific margins or spacing preferences for the chart layout?'
