initial_prompt: I have data on coffee preferences and consumption from a recent survey.
  Please create a line chart that visualizes the average number of cups of coffee
  consumed daily across different age groups (18-24, 25-34, etc.). Additionally, plot
  another line showing the preferred brewing method (e.g., drip, capsule, bean-to-cup)
  across these age groups. Each line should represent an age group, showing trends
  in both coffee consumption and brewing preferences. This will help to understand
  the correlation between age, consumption, and brewing methods. Ensure the chart
  is clear and easy to read. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the line chart?

  2. Do you want to use different line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) to distinguish
  between age groups?

  3. Should the x-axis represent specific age ranges, or do you prefer a continuous
  age scale?

  4. Do you want data points to be marked on the lines?

  5. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  6. Do you need any specific annotations or labels on the chart?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between coffee consumption
  and brewing methods?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s gridlines (e.g., minor, major, none)?

  9. Should the chart include axis titles, and if so, what should they be?

  10. Do you prefer setting specific limits for the y-axis, or should it adjust based
  on the data automatically?'
