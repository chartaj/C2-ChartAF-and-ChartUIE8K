initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the favorite types of coffee from
  the Coffee Taste Test data. Use the 'favorite' column data to show the distribution
  of different coffee preferences among the participants. The chart should have segments
  for each unique coffee type, such as 'Regular drip coffee', 'Iced coffee', etc.,
  and the size of each segment should represent the proportion of participants who
  prefer that type. Ensure the chart is colorful and labeled for easy understanding.
  This will help in quickly understanding which type of coffee is most popular among
  the respondents.

  use for the pie chart?

  with lines connecting to the segments?

  4. Is there a specific font style or size you''d like for the labels and legend
  text?

  5. Do you have a preference for the order of the segments (e.g., by size, alphabetically)?

  6. Would you like to include a title for the pie chart? If so, what should it be?

  7. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it positioned
  (e.g., right, bottom, top)?

  in the chart?
