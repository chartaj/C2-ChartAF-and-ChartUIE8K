initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the favorite types of coffee based
  on age groups from the data provided. The x-axis should represent different age
  groups, and the y-axis should show the count of each favorite coffee type (e.g.,
  Regular drip coffee, Iced coffee, etc.). Each column within an age group should
  represent a different coffee type. This will help us understand the coffee preferences
  across different age demographics. Make sure to label the axes accordingly and include
  a legend to differentiate coffee types.
