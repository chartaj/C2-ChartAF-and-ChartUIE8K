initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing the favorite coffee types (“favorite”)
  based on different age groups (“age”). Each bar cluster should represent an age
  group, and within each cluster, individual bars should show the count of each favorite
  coffee type. This will help us see how coffee preferences vary across different
  age groups. Use the provided Coffee Taste Test survey data for this. Make sure to
  label each axis, with the age groups on the X-axis and the count of favorite coffee
  types on the Y-axis. Also, include a legend to identify the coffee types.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the different coffee types in
  the legend?

  2. Do you have a specific order in which age groups should be displayed on the X-axis?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and legends?

  4. Would you prefer gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability,
  and if so, in what style?

  5. Are there any specific title or header preferences for the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not have a specific order in mind for the age groups on the X-axis.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, I would prefer gridlines to be displayed for better readability.

  5. I have no specific preference for the title or header.'
