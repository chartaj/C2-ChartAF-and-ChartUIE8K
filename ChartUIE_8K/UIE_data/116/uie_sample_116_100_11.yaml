initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart visualizing the average “cups” of coffee consumed
  per age group, categorized by “favorite” coffee type. I'd also like to see another
  box chart showing how the “brew” method varies with “age.” These charts should help
  understand the drinking habits and preferences of different age groups. In the “Coffee
  Taste Test” data, this could provide insights into popular coffee choices and brewing
  methods across age demographics. These visualizations will be valuable in identifying
  trends and preferences, enhancing my understanding of consumer behavior in coffee
  consumption.
questions: '1. What color theme or palette do you prefer for the charts?

  2. Do you have a preference for the layout of the chart elements (e.g., horizontal
  or vertical orientation)?

  3. Would you like any specific labels or annotations to be highlighted on the charts?

  4. Do you prefer the boxes to show outliers or keep them hidden?

  5. How would you like the age groups to be categorized (e.g., specific intervals
  or ranges)?

  6. Should the ''average cups'' of coffee be shown as a specific line or marker on
  the box plots?

  7. Do you prefer a specific order for the ''favorite'' coffee types and ''brew''
  methods on the axis?

  8. Any specific font type and size preferences for the chart labels and legends?

  9. Would you like gridlines or background shading for better readability?

  10. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the charts?'
