initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing average SAT scores over time. Highlight
  schools with the maximum and minimum mean scores in Critical Reading, Mathematics,
  and Writing. Add data-driven text annotations for peak values. This should emphasize
  trends and performance differences among schools.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the schools
  and highlighting the maximum and minimum scores?

  2. Would you like to see separate lines for each school, or should the lines be
  aggregated by some category?

  3. How would you like the x-axis to be labeled (e.g., specific years, test dates)?

  4. Should the chart display grid lines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a preference for their appearance?

  5. Do you have a preference for the style of data-driven text annotations (e.g.,
  font size, color)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to help identify the different schools and
  score types?

  7. How much detail would you like in the tooltips (e.g., all score components, only
  highlighted information)?

  8. Are there any specific trends or performance details you would like to emphasize
  further?'
