initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing the Global Air Transport Data
  for registered carrier departures from 2005 to 2020. Each bar should represent a
  year, and the segments within each bar should show the departures for Afghanistan,
  Albania, and Algeria. Highlight any missing values distinctively. The chart should
  be labeled with years on the x-axis and number of departures on the y-axis. Include
  a legend for the countries. Use different colors for each country and make sure
  the chart is clear and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each country (Afghanistan,
  Albania, Algeria)?

  2. Do you prefer any specific color for highlighting missing values?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like a title for the chart? If so, what should the title be?

  6. Do you need any specific notations or annotations on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
