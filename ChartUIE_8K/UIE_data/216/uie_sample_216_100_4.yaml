initial_prompt: I need a line chart that shows the trend of registered carrier departures
  for different countries from 2005 to 2020. The x-axis should represent the years,
  and the y-axis should represent the number of registered carrier departures. Please
  plot the data for Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria, each represented by a separate
  line on the chart. Also, highlight any missing data points clearly. This will help
  visualize the changes in air transport activity over the years for these countries.
  Make sure the chart is easy to read with proper labels and a legend.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferences for the colors of the lines representing
  each country?

  2. What style or thickness would you like for the lines in the chart?

  3. Is there a specific font style and size you prefer for the labels and legend?

  4. How would you like the missing data points to be highlighted (e.g., different
  color, marker shape)?

  5. Do you need any gridlines on the chart for better readability? If so, vertical,
  horizontal, or both?

  6. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers for significant
  events or changes in data?'
