initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the global air transport data,
  specifically showing the relationship between years and registered carrier departures
  worldwide. Use the x-axis to represent the years from 2005 to 2020 and the y-axis
  for the number of departures. Differentiate countries with distinct markers or colors.
  Make sure to include data points for each country available in the dataset across
  the years. Highlight any missing data appropriately to maintain clarity and accuracy.
  Title the chart "Global Air Transport Trends (2005-2020)" and label the axes clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors or markers used
  to differentiate the countries?

  2. How would you like missing data to be highlighted (e.g., different color markers,
  shapes, or annotations)?

  3. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the title and axis labels?

  4. Would you like grid lines to be included on the plot, and if so, in what style
  or color?

  5. Should the data points have tooltips or labels displaying the exact values when
  hovered over?

  6. Is there a specific order or importance of countries that should be emphasized
  in the plot?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the range or scaling of the y-axis to better
  highlight trends?

  8. Would you like a legend included, and if so, where would you prefer it to be
  placed on the chart?'
