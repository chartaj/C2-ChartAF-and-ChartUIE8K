initial_prompt: 'I need a heatmap visualization using the Global Rice Production Statistics
  Dataset. Specifically, the heatmap should illustrate the relationship between different
  countries'' rice production metrics. Include the following columns in the heatmap:
  ''Country'', ''Rice Production (Tons)'', ''Rank of Rice Production'', ''Rice Production
  Per Person (Kg)'', ''Rank of Rice Production Per Person'', ''Rice Acreage (Hectare)'',
  ''Rank of Rice Acreage'', ''Rice Yield (Kg / Hectare)'', and ''Rank of Rice Yield''.
  The heatmap should help in identifying trends and correlations across these metrics
  for various countries.'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to display numerical values on the heatmap cells?

  3. How would you like to handle missing data in the dataset?

  4. Should we include a specific title for the heatmap?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the axes labels and their formatting?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color gradient used in the
  heatmap?

  7. Are there any specific countries you would like to highlight or focus on?

  8. Do you have a preferred layout for the heatmap (e.g., country names on rows or
  columns)?

  9. Is there a specific order you would like the countries to be arranged in the
  heatmap?

  10. Would you like to apply any specific statistical methods to enhance the correlation
  visualization (e.g., clustering)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like to display numerical values on the heatmap cells.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color gradient used in the heatmap.
