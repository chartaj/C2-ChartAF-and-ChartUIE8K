initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualizing global rice production data by country.
  Include text annotations for top producers to highlight their contribution and emphasize
  key figures using bright colors. Also, highlight countries with high rice production
  per person.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting key figures
  and top producers?

  2. How many top-producing countries would you like to be annotated with text?

  3. Do you have a specific threshold for defining "high rice production per person"
  that should be highlighted?

  4. Should the text annotations include absolute production figures, relative contributions,
  or both?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the text annotations?

  6. Are there any particular countries you already consider essential to emphasize
  in the visualization?

  7. Should the treemap maintain a geographical aspect, or should it be solely based
  on production figures?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Both absolute production figures and relative contributions.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Solely based on production figures.'
