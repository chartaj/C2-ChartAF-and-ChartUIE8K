initial_prompt: Create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of rice production
  among different countries using the "Rice Production (Tons)" column from the Global
  Rice Production Statistics Dataset. Ensure each slice represents a country's contribution
  to global rice production. Include labels with country names and their respective
  production values in tons. Highlight the top 5 highest rice-producing countries
  with distinct colors, and group the rest under an "Others" category. This visualization
  should offer a quick comparative understanding of the global rice production landscape.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the top 5 highest rice-producing
  countries?

  2. How would you like the "Others" category to be colored or displayed?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the labels?

  4. Would you like the labels to display percentages in addition to production values
  in tons?

  5. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, do you have any preferences for
  its position?

  6. Do you prefer the chart to have any specific title or subtitle?

  7. Would you like any specific visual effects such as 3D or gradient fills for the
  pie slices?'
