initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing global rice production statistics
  from the dataset. The map should display countries with varying shades based on
  rice production (tons). Additionally, include hover-over information to show detailed
  metrics such as total rice production, production rank, rice production per person,
  acreage, and yield per hectare. Ensure the map is interactive so users can explore
  and compare the data. Utilize the latest data available from the dataset to provide
  the most accurate and up-to-date visualization. Title the map "Global Rice Production
  Statistics" and include a legend explaining the color gradients.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for representing different levels of
  rice production (e.g., shades of green, blue, or a gradient from light to dark)?

  2. Do you have a preference for specific countries to be highlighted or annotated
  on the map?

  3. How would you like the legend to be styled (e.g., horizontal or vertical, specific
  colors)?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the hover-over information format or order of
  displayed metrics?

  5. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the map for specific
  insights?

  6. Are there any geographical boundaries or regions you want to emphasize or de-emphasize
  on the map?

  7. Do you have a preference for the granularity of the data classification (e.g.,
  equal intervals, quantiles, natural breaks)?

  8. What font style and size would you prefer for the map title and legend text?'
answers: '1. I am not sure, but a gradient from light to dark might work well.

  2. I do not have any specific preferences for countries to be highlighted or annotated.

  3. I am not sure about the legend style, maybe vertical.

  4. I would prefer the metrics in this order: total rice production, production rank,
  rice production per person, acreage, and yield per hectare.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for additional annotations or markers.

  6. I do not know about emphasizing or de-emphasizing any regions.

  7. I am not sure about the data classification granularity.

  8. I have no specific preference for the font style or size, just need it to be
  readable.'
