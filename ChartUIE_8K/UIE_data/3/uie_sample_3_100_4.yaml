initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot visualizing the "Global Rice Production Statistics
  Dataset". Please plot "Rice Production (Tons)" on the x-axis and "Rice Yield (Kg
  / Hectare)" on the y-axis. Mark different countries by their respective names on
  the plot. Use different colors or markers to distinguish between different countries.
  Make sure missing values are appropriately handled or excluded from the visualization.
  Add axis labels, a title, and a legend for clarity. This should allow a clear comparison
  of rice production versus yield for various countries globally. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different countries?

  2. Would you prefer markers or colors to distinguish between different countries?

  3. Do you have any font preferences for the country names on the plot?

  4. Is there a specific title you would like for the scatter plot?

  5. Do you have preferences for the x-axis and y-axis labels?

  6. How would you like the missing values to be handled or indicated on the plot?

  7. Are there specific sizes or shapes you prefer for the markers representing different
  countries?

  8. Would you like to add any specific annotations or notes to the plot?

  9. Do you have any particular style or theme preferences for the scatter plot (e.g.,
  minimalist, bold colors, etc.)?

  10. Would you like to include grid lines or background shading in the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.
