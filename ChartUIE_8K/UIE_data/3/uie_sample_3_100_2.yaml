initial_prompt: Create a table chart to visualize global rice production statistics.
  The table should include columns for country, rice production (tons), rice production
  per person (kg), rice acreage (hectares), and rice yield (kg/hectare). Highlight
  the top 10 countries in each category. Use text annotations to draw attention to
  countries with the highest and lowest production values. This visualization should
  help understand the distribution of rice production and yield efficiency across
  different countries, aiding in agricultural planning and research.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the top 10 countries
  in each category?

  2. Should the table include additional columns for rank in each category?

  3. How would you like the text annotations for highest and lowest production values
  to be formatted? (e.g., bold, different color, etc.)

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text in the table?

  5. Would you like the table to be sorted by any specific column initially?

  6. Should countries with missing values be included or excluded from the table?

  7. Do you require any specific legends or notes to be included in the chart?

  8. Is there a required format for numeric values, such as commas or decimal places,
  in the table?

  9. Would you like to include a title and/or a subtitle for the table chart? If so,
  please specify.

  10. Should there be any row or column borders to enhance readability? If so, please
  specify the style.'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Bold text should be good for highlighting the highest and lowest production values.

  4. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  5. The table should be initially sorted by rice production (tons).

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please use commas for thousands and no decimal places for the table.

  9. Yes, the title should be "Global Rice Production Statistics" and the subtitle
  "Top Rice Producing Countries and Yield Efficiency".

  10. I am not sure.'
