initial_prompt: Create a box chart to visualize the Global Rice Production Statistics
  Dataset. Use data from 3.csv to show the distribution of 'Rice Yield (Kg / Hectare)'
  across different countries. Ensure that the box chart includes the quartiles, median,
  and outliers. Additionally, highlight and label individual countries like 'Chile,'
  'Mauritania,' and 'Turkey' on the chart for context. This will help in comparing
  the rice yield across these specific countries versus the overall global data distribution
  in a compact, easy-to-understand visual format.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box chart?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be represented (e.g., dots, asterisks)?

  3. Would you prefer the chart to have a title and axis labels? If so, what should
  they be?

  4. Do you have any specific font style or size preferences for the labels and annotations?

  5. Should gridlines be included in the background of the chart for easier reading?

  6. How would you like the highlighted countries to be represented (e.g., different
  color, bold outlines)?

  7. Do you want the chart to include a legend? If so, what details should it contain?

  8. Are there any specific dimensions or aspect ratios you''d like for the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color scheme preference.

  2. I am not sure, maybe dots.

  3. Yes, the chart should have a title and axis labels. The title could be "Global
  Rice Yield Distribution," and the axis labels should be "Countries" for the x-axis
  and "Rice Yield (Kg / Hectare)" for the y-axis.

  4. I do not have any specific font style or size preferences.

  5. Yes, include gridlines in the background for easier reading.

  6. Highlighted countries can be represented with different colors.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. I do not know.'
