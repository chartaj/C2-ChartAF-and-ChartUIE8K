  ensure it''s clear.

  4. Yes, please include grid lines for better scaling and readability.

  5. I do not have a specific style preference for the legend.

  6. No specific preference, but a title like "Top 10 Countries in Rice Production"
  with a subtitle "With Production per Person (Kg)" would be good.

  7. No, additional annotations or callouts are not necessary.

  8. Vertical bars would be preferred.

  9. Linear scaling for the axis would be fine.
