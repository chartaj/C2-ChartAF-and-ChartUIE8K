initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart showcasing the top 10 countries in terms
  of rice production (Tons) from the Global Rice Production Statistics Dataset. Label
  the x-axis with country names and the y-axis with rice production in tons. Highlight
  each bar with a different color for better visibility. Additionally, provide the
  production per person (Kg) as an overlay on each bar. Ensure the chart is easy to
  understand, with clear legends and proper scaling.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for each bar?

  2. Would you like to have specific fonts or font sizes for the labels on the x-axis
  and y-axis?

  3. Do you prefer the production per person (Kg) overlay to be in a particular format
  (e.g., numeric label, small bar)?

  4. Should the chart include grid lines for better scaling and readability?

  5. Is there a particular style you prefer for the legend (e.g., position, size,
  font)?

  6. Do you require any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include additional annotations or callouts for any specific
  data points?

  8. Is there a preferred orientation for the bar chart (e.g., horizontal or vertical
  bars)?

  9. Do you have any preferences regarding the axis scaling (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  10. Are there any specific margins or padding you would like around the chart?'
