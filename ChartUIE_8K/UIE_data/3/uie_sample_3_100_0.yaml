initial_prompt: Please create a treemap visualization using the Global Rice Production
  Statistics Dataset to highlight key data points. Annotate countries with the highest
  and lowest rice production per person and distinguish elements based on their rank
  in rice yield. Use color and size to emphasize production volume and acreage. This
  will help focus attention on significant producers and their efficiency in land
  use. Provide text annotations to draw attention to specific noteworthy values, especially
  outliers in production yield and acreage. This chart should offer a clear and concise
  visual summary of global rice production statistics.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to represent different
  production volumes and acreage?

  2. How many categories or gradations of colors would you like to be used for different
  ranges of production volumes and acreage?

  3. Would you like specific font styles or sizes for the text annotations highlighting
  key data points?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain the color and size encodings used
  in the treemap?

  5. Do you want to include any additional labels or specific information on the chart
  aside from country names, production volumes, and acreage?

  6. Do you have any preferred layout options for the treemap to ensure better readability
  and comparison?

  7. Are there any specific countries or regions you would like to be more prominently
  displayed or highlighted in the treemap?

  8. Would you prefer the treemap to have borders or outlines around each block to
  distinguish between different segments clearly?

  9. Is there a maximum or minimum size constraint for the blocks in the treemap to
  maintain visual clarity and focus?'

  2. I do not know.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, the chart should include a legend to explain the color and size encodings
  used in the treemap.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the layout.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, please include borders or outlines around each block to distinguish between
  different segments clearly.
