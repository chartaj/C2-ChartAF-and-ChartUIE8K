  The table should include columns for country, rice production (tons), rice production
  per person (kg), rice acreage (hectares), and rice yield (kg/hectare). Highlight
  the top 10 countries in each category. Use text annotations to draw attention to
  countries with the highest and lowest production values. This visualization should
