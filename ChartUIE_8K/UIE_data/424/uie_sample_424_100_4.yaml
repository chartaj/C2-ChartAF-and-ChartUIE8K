initial_prompt: I want to create a histogram to visualize the bird counts during Christmas
  time in the Hamilton area of Ontario. The x-axis should represent the different
  bird species (both common names and Latin names combined), and the y-axis should
  show the total number of birds counted. Make sure to handle any missing data appropriately.
  Additionally, I'd like another histogram that shows the number of birds counted
  per hour, so the x-axis will be the number of birds counted and the y-axis will
  be the frequency of those counts. Please help me make this.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for the histograms?

  2. Would you like any specific fonts or font sizes to be used for the axis labels
  and titles?

  3. Should the histograms include grid lines for better readability?

  4. Do you prefer a particular style for the bars in the histograms, such as solid
  color, gradient, or pattern?

  5. How should missing data be represented in the histograms?

  6. Would you like to add any annotations or labels directly on the bars for specific
  bird species or counts?

  7. Should the histograms include a legend explaining the elements shown?

  8. Do you prefer the histograms to be displayed side-by-side, stacked, or in separate
  sections for a better comparison?

  9. Is there a specific range or scale you would like the y-axis to follow for better
  clarity?

  10. Would you like to include any background elements or images related to birds
  or the Hamilton area?'

  7. No, a legend is not necessary.

  8. I prefer the histograms to be displayed in separate sections for better comparison.
