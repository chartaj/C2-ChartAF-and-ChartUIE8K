initial_prompt: Create a bar chart showcasing bird counts during Christmas time in
  the Hamilton area of Ontario, focusing on species observed and their count totals.
  Highlight American Bittern, American Black Duck, and American Coot by changing their
  bar colors to distinguish them from other species. Add annotations for these species
  to display their exact counts, scientific names, and the year 1921. The chart should
  provide visual clarity on which species were most or least observed, emphasizing
  the zoological aspect, and provide context for conservation studies.
