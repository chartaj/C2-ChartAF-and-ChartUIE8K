initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trends of child labor in
  urban Britain and UK boys over time. Use the provided data from 1851 to 1871. The
  x-axis should show the years and the y-axis should represent the percentage of child
  labor. Include separate lines for "Child Labor in Urban Britain" and "Child Labor
  UK boys, historic" to compare the two trends effectively. Ensure the chart is clear
  and easy to understand, highlighting the severity and patterns in child labor during
  this historical period. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the lines representing each
  trend?

  2. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines?

  3. Should the chart incorporate a legend to distinguish between the two trends?

  4. Do you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like for the axis labels
  and title?

  6. Should we include annotations or highlights to emphasize significant changes
  or trends?

  7. Is there a particular format for the percentage values on the y-axis (e.g., whole
  numbers, one decimal place)?

  8. Do you want to add any specific title or subtitle to the chart?

  9. Would you like to display tooltips when hovering over the lines for additional
  data insights?

  either the x-axis or y-axis?'
