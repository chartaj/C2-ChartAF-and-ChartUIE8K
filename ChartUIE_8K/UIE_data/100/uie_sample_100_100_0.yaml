initial_prompt: Visualize a Bubble chart for women fashion trends, focusing on 'units_sold',
  'rating', 'price', and 'product_color'. Highlight bubbles based on 'units_sold'
  showing popularity. Use color to differentiate 'product_color'. Incorporate annotations
  to display highest 'rating' products and their 'price'.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you''d like
  to use for the ''product_color'' differentiation?

  2. What size do you envision for each bubble in the chart based on ''units_sold''?

  3. How detailed should the annotations for the highest ''rating'' products be? Should
  they include additional information besides ''rating'' and ''price''?

  4. Are there any specific labels or legends you would like to add to the chart?

  5. Should the chart have specific axis ranges for ''price'' or ''rating'', or should
  it be auto-scaled based on the data?

  6. Do you prefer any particular sorting order (e.g., by ''units_sold'', ''price'',
  or ''rating'') for the bubbles in the chart?'
answers: '1. I don''t have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I''m not sure about the exact size, but larger bubbles for higher ''units_sold''
  to show popularity would be ideal.

  3. I am not sure about additional details, but having ''rating'' and ''price'' in
  the annotations is sufficient.

  4. I do not know about specific labels or legends to add.

  5. The chart can be auto-scaled based on the data.

  6. I have no specific preference for sorting order.'
