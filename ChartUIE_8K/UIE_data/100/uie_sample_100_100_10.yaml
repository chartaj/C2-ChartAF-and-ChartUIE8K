initial_prompt: I need a bar chart visualizing the trends in Women Fashion, showcasing
  the average ratings for different product titles over time. Use the 'title' as the
  categories on the X-axis and the 'rating' as the values on the Y-axis. Highlight
  the 'units_sold' for each title using different colors or shades. Make sure to also
  display the 'merchant_title' in the legend, showing the source of these products.
  Ensure the chart is clear, concise, and gives a quick insight into which products
  are highly rated and popular among customers.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the chart?

  2. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the product titles on the X-axis? (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by rating, by units sold)

  3. How would you like the ''units_sold'' to be represented in terms of colors or
  shades? Should higher units sold be darker/more intense or lighter/less intense?

  4. Is there a specific range you want to focus on for the ratings?

  5. Would you like any specific style or format for the legend displaying the ''merchant_title''?

  6. Should the bar chart include grid lines for easier reading, and if so, in which
  directions (vertical, horizontal, or both)?

  7. Do you need labels or tooltips for the bars to display specific values like rating
  or units sold?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. By rating.

  3. Higher units sold should be darker/more intense.

  4. I do not know.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. Both vertical and horizontal grid lines.

  7. Yes, include labels to display rating and units sold.'
