initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map visualizing the distribution of product shipments
  for the Women Fashion Trend Dataset. Use 'countries_shipped_to' as the key metric
  to highlight the number of countries each product is shipped to. Shade each country
  based on the count, with a legend indicating the range of values. This will help
