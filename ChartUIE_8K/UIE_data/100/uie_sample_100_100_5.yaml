initial_prompt: Create an Area Chart to visualize the trend of units sold over time
  for different product themes from the Women Fashion Trend Dataset. The x-axis should
  represent the crawl month, and the y-axis should show the units sold. Use different
  colors to differentiate between themes such as 'summer', 'winter', etc. Highlight
  any peaks in sales and provide a legend. This will help identify seasonal trends
  in women's fashion. Make sure the chart is easy to read and interpret, reflecting
  the fluctuations in units sold across different months.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for differentiating between
  product themes?

  2. Do you have a preferred color scheme (e.g., pastel, vibrant, monochromatic)?

  3. Would you like gridlines to be included for better readability of the chart?

  4. Do you prefer the x-axis labels to display every month, or only specific intervals
  (e.g., quarterly)?

  5. What specific title would you like for the chart?

  6. Do you have a preference on the font size and style for the chart labels and
  title?

  7. Should the chart legend be positioned at a specific location (e.g., top-right,
  bottom-left)?

  8. Do you want any specific annotations or callouts for the peaks in sales?

  9. Would you like to include the exact units sold values at the peaks or along the
  area segments?

  10. Should the y-axis start from zero, or do you prefer it to be dynamically scaled
  based on the data range?

  11. Do you have a preference for the overall size or aspect ratio of the chart?'
