initial_prompt: Please create a Donut chart to visualize the distribution of different
  product themes in the Women Fashion Trend Dataset. Use the theme data provided in
  the sample_data section. Ensure that the chart segments represent the unique themes
  and their respective counts. This will help in understanding which themes are most
  common in the dataset. Make sure the chart is easily readable with clear labels
  for each segment and include a legend to identify different themes. Also, indicate
  the total number of each theme as a percentage of the whole. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the donut chart?

  2. How would you like the theme labels to be displayed (within the segments or outside
  with lines pointing to the segments)?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the font size and style for the labels?

  4. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the themes to be displayed in (e.g., highest
  to lowest count)?
