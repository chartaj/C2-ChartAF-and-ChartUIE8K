initial_prompt: Create a line chart to show the relationship between price and units
  sold for the Women Fashion Trend Dataset. Plot the 'price' on the x-axis and 'units_sold'
  on the y-axis. Use different colors or markers to represent different 'product_color'.
  The chart should help us understand how the pricing of fashion items correlates
  with the number of units sold. Include labels and a legend for clarity. This visualization
  will assist in making informed pricing strategies for different fashion products
  based on their color variations and sales performance.
