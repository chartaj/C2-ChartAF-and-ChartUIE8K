initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap from the Women Fashion Trend Dataset. Visualize
  the relationship between product ratings and units sold across different product
  colors. Each axis should represent one of these parameters: ratings, units sold,
  and product colors. Color intensity in the heatmap should indicate the frequency
  or density of ratings and units sold combinations per color. This will help in identifying
  which product colors tend to have higher sales and better ratings, aiding in product
  and marketing decisions. Ensure the chart is clear, labeled, and easy to interpret.
  Use data from the latest available crawl month. Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the color intensity to be represented (e.g., specific gradient,
  color palette)?

  or sizes for labels and titles?'
