initial_prompt: Please create a violin plot for the Women Fashion Trend Dataset focused
  on the 'price' and 'rating' columns. I want to visualize the distribution of prices
  and ratings for the different women's fashion products. The x-axis should represent
  the 'price' and the y-axis should represent the 'rating'. Include all data points
  and ensure the plot is annotated properly for easy interpretation. This will help
  in understanding the spread and density of prices versus ratings. Title the plot
  appropriately and ensure it reflects the fashion and beauty theme. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes or themes for the violin plot
  that reflect the fashion and beauty context?

  2. Would you like the data points to be color-coded by any specific categories,
  such as product type or product color?

  3. Do you want any additional annotations, such as median values or quartiles, to
  be included in the plot?

  4. Are there any particular ranges for ''price'' or ''rating'' that you want to
  focus on or highlight?

  5. Do you have a specific format or style for the plot title and axis labels you
  would prefer?

  6. Would you like to include any specific legends or keys to aid in interpreting
  the plot?

  7. Do you want the plot to include gridlines or other background elements to improve
  readability?'
