initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the distribution of prices
  for womenâ€™s fashion items from the dataset. Make sure to use the 'price' column.
  Each point on the box chart should represent individual prices, showing the range,
  interquartile range, and any outliers. Additionally, differentiate the box plots
  based on the 'units_sold' column by categorizing them into high, medium, and low
  units sold. This will help us understand how prices vary with the quantity sold.
  Ensure the chart is clearly labeled and easy to interpret. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color schemes of the different
  categories (high, medium, low units sold)?

  2. Would you like to add a title to the chart? If so, do you have a specific title
  in mind?

  3. Do you have specific labels for the high, medium, and low units sold categories?

  4. Is there a particular way you would like to categorize the units sold into high,
  medium, and low? For example, would you like to use specific numeric ranges?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the chart labels and title?

  6. Would you like to add any additional annotations or comments on the chart to
  highlight specific points or trends?

  7. Is there a preferred way to display outliers (e.g., specific marker shapes or
  colors)?

  8. Do you want any gridlines on the chart? If so, do you have a preference for the
  style (solid, dashed, etc.)?

  9. Are there any additional metrics or information you would like displayed alongside
  the box plots?

  any preferences for its placement?'
