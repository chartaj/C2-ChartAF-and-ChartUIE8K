initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the yeast.csv data from the genomics
  domain. I want histograms for the columns 'mcg' and 'gvh'. Annotate significant
  data points to highlight outliers. Also, use different colors to emphasize the distinction
  between different histogram bins. Add text annotations to indicate the mean and
  median of these columns, and provide a general summary of the distribution. The
  visualization aims to easily communicate the statistical properties and range of
  these genomics data features for a quick overview.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the histogram bins?

  2. Should the color scheme be gradient or categorical?

  3. Do you want the outliers to be marked with specific symbols or colors?

  4. Is there a specific format or style you prefer for the text annotations of mean
  and median?

  5. How detailed should the annotations for significant data points be?

  6. Would you prefer horizontal or vertical histograms?

  7. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histograms?

  8. Should the summary of the distribution be included within the chart or in a separate
  section?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font styles or sizes for the annotations and axis
  labels?

  10. Should grid lines be displayed in the background of the histogram?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette for the histogram bins.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I think specific colors would be good for marking outliers.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I don''t know, maybe just highlight the significant ones clearly.

  6. Vertical histograms would be preferred.

  7. I do not know.

  8. The summary of the distribution should be included within the chart.

  9. I do not have any specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  10. Yes, grid lines should be displayed in the background of the histogram.'
