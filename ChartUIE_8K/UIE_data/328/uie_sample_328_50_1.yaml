initial_prompt: Create a histogram for each numeric column (mcg, gvh, alm, mit, erl,
  pox, vac, nuc) showing their distribution. Highlight the 'erl' data points. Annotate
  any outliers.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for highlighting the ''erl''
  data points?

  4. Do you have a preferred method for annotating outliers (e.g., arrows, labels,
  different colors)?

  5. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the histograms (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, colorful)?

  6. Would you like to include any descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard
  deviation) on the histogram charts?

  7. Do you require gridlines or background shading on the histograms for better readability?
