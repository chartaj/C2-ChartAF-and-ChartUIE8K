  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the

  prefer lines only?

  3. Do you want grid lines for better readability of the data? If so, both horizontal
  and vertical, or one of them?

  4. Would you prefer a specific style for the chart background (e.g., plain, light
  shading, etc.)?

  5. Should there be a legend indicating which line corresponds to each attribute,
  and if so, where should it be placed (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  6. Do you need titles for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they be?

  7. Is there a preferred title for the entire chart?

  8. Do you want the y-axis to start at zero, or should it auto-adjust based on data
  values?

  9. Should the line chart include any smoothing, or should the data points be directly
  connected?

  10. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and
