2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a histogram using the yeast.csv data from the genomics domain. I want
  histograms for the columns 'mcg' and 'gvh'. Annotate significant data points to
  highlight outliers. Also, use different colors to emphasize the distinction between
  different histogram bins. Add text annotations to indicate the mean and median of
  these columns, and provide a general summary of the distribution. The visualization
  aims to easily communicate the statistical properties and range of these genomics
  data features for a quick overview.
