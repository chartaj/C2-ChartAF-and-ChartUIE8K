initial_prompt: Create a bar chart comparing 'mcg', 'gvh', 'alm', and 'mit' for different
  'name' categories from the yeast genomics dataset. Annotate the chart with sample
  data points to highlight key differences. Highlight bars with unique values.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. Should each ''name'' category have a different color for better distinction?

  3. How would you like the unique values to be highlighted (e.g., color, border,
  pattern)?

  4. Is there a specific annotation style you prefer for the sample data points (e.g.,
  text labels, arrows)?

  5. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bar chart (horizontal or
  vertical)?

  6. Would you like gridlines in the background to make value comparison easier?

  7. Should the y-axis be standardized across all attributes or should each attribute
  have its own scale?

  8. Do you want the chart to include a legend explaining the colors or patterns used?

  9. Is there a preferred font style and size for the annotations and labels?

  10. Should there be any specific spacing or alignment preferences for the bars within
  each category?

  11. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  12. Would you like to display the exact values at the tip of each bar?'
