initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the yeast.csv dataset from the genomics
  category. Plot the 'mcg' values on the X-axis and 'gvh' values on the Y-axis. Highlight
  data points classified under 'name' column as 'MIT' in a different color to distinguish
  them. Include text annotations displaying 'alm' values for these highlighted points.
  The purpose of this chart is to visually analyze the relationship between 'mcg'
  and 'gvh', with a focus on how 'alm' values vary among the 'MIT' classified points.
  This will help in understanding specific patterns and anomalies within the genomics
  data.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the scatter plot, especially
  for highlighting the ''MIT'' classified points?

  2. Are there specific sizes or types of markers you prefer for the data points?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart? If yes, should they be major
  grid lines, minor grid lines, or both?

  4. Should the axis labels and title have any specific formatting (font size, style,
  or color)?

  5. Do you want to display a legend on the chart? If yes, where should it be placed
  (top, bottom, left, right)?

  6. Should the chart have a specific title? If yes, please provide the title.

  7. Do you have any preferences for the size or resolution of the text annotations
  for ''alm'' values?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind, so please choose one that makes
  the ''MIT'' points clearly distinguishable.

  2. I am not sure about the marker types or sizes.

  3. I am not sure about grid lines.

  4. I do not have any specific preferences for the formatting of the axis labels
  and title.

  5. Yes, please display a legend on the chart. The placement can be on the right.

  6. Yes, the title should be "Scatter Plot of mcg vs gvh with MIT Points Highlighted".

  7. I do not know about specific preferences for the size or resolution of the text
  annotations for ''alm'' values.
