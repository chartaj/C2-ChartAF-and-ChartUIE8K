initial_prompt: Compare the trends of 'mcg', 'gvh', 'alm', and 'mit' values from yeast.csv
  over the samples. A line chart with each of these attributes on the y-axis and sample
  indices on the x-axis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing ''mcg'', ''gvh'', ''alm'', and ''mit'' values?

  2. Should the chart include markers for each sample point on the lines, or do you
  prefer lines only?

  3. Do you want grid lines for better readability of the data? If so, both horizontal
  and vertical, or one of them?

  4. Would you prefer a specific style for the chart background (e.g., plain, light
  shading, etc.)?

  5. Should there be a legend indicating which line corresponds to each attribute,
  and if so, where should it be placed (e.g., top right, bottom left)?

  6. Do you need titles for the x-axis and y-axis? If so, what should they be?

  7. Is there a preferred title for the entire chart?

  8. Do you want the y-axis to start at zero, or should it auto-adjust based on data
  values?

  9. Should the line chart include any smoothing, or should the data points be directly
  connected?

  10. Is there any specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and
  chart title?

  11. Do you want any annotations or highlights on the chart to emphasize specific
  data points or trends?'
