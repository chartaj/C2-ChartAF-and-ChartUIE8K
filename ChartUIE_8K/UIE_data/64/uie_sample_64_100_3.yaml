initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Apple stock prices with columns like Date, Open,
  High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume. I need a heatmap to visualize this
  data effectively. The heatmap should highlight correlations between different measures
  like Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume over time. It should help identify
  periods with high trading volumes and price changes. Ensure that the heatmap is
  easy to interpret, with a clear legend and color gradient to show various intensities.
  This visual representation will help in understanding the stock's performance trends.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color gradient used in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include any specific annotations or markers for particular
  dates or periods in the heatmap?

  3. Do you prefer a specific layout for the legend of the heatmap?

  4. Are there any specific ranges or thresholds you would like highlighted in the
  heatmap?

  5. Would you like the heatmap to display exact correlation values, or just visually
  represent the correlations through colors?

  6. Do you have a preferred ordering of the variables (e.g., Open, Close, Volume)
  on the axes?

  7. Should weekends and non-trading days be excluded from the heatmap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color gradient.

  2. I do not know if specific annotations are needed.

  3. I have no specific preference for the legend layout.

  4. I am not sure about specific ranges or thresholds.

  5. I prefer the heatmap to visually represent correlations through colors.

  6. I do not have a preferred ordering of the variables.

  7. Yes, exclude weekends and non-trading days.'
