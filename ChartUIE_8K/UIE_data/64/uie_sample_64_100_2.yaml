initial_prompt: I want a box chart visualizing Apple's stock prices over time. The
  chart should have boxes for key statistics like the Open, High, Low, and Close prices,
  along with Volume. Use text annotations to highlight specific dates with notable
  price changes, emphasizing any outliers or significant trading volumes. Additionally,
  include highlights to make the key statistics stand out, perhaps by using different
  colors or sizes for more critical elements. Make sure the chart clearly shows trends
  and extreme values to provide a comprehensive view of Apple's stock performance
  for business analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the different elements
  in the chart?

  2. Are there any particular dates or events you want to be highlighted as notable
  price changes?

  3. How would you like the significant trading volumes to be emphasized (e.g., different
  size, color, or both)?

  4. What time frame should the chart cover (e.g., years, months, days)?

  5. Do you prefer the chart to display data for all trading days or only specific
  intervals (e.g., weekly, monthly)?

  6. Should the annotations for notable dates include any additional information (e.g.,
  reason for price change, news events)?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the style of text annotations (e.g., font size,
  font type, color)?

  8. How would you like extreme values to be differentiated from regular values (e.g.,
  using shapes, colors, or labels)?

  9. Would you like to include any trend lines or moving averages in the chart to
  help visualize trends over time?'
