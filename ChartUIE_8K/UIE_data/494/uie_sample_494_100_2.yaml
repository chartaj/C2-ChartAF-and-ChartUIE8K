initial_prompt: I need a visualization for my data involving time, signal1, and signal2.
  Can you create a distribution plot for signal1 and signal2? Ensure the chart highlights
  any prominent features or patterns. Use shapes like arrows or rectangles to emphasize
  important data points or ranges. The goal is to easily identify trends or outliers
  in the signals over time. This is for data analysis purposes, so clarity and emphasis
  on key details are crucial. Please incorporate visual cues to make the distinctions
  between the signals clear. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between signal1
  and signal2?

  2. Are there specific time ranges or data points that you want to highlight with
  arrows or rectangles?

  3. Would you prefer a specific type of distribution plot like histograms, density
  plots, or box plots?

  4. Do you have any preferences for axis scales (linear, logarithmic) or axis labels?

  5. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want to include on the chart?

  6. How detailed should the visual cues (like arrows or rectangles) be in highlighting
  important data points or ranges?

  7. Do you have a preference for the style or thickness of lines or shapes used to
  highlight data points?

  8. Are there specific trends or patterns within the data that you are particularly
  interested in?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I want to highlight the significant peaks and troughs.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer linear scales and clear axis labels for time, signal1, and signal2.

  5. I do not have specific annotations or labels in mind.

  6. The visual cues should be detailed enough to clearly show the important data
  points or ranges but not too cluttered.

  7. I do not have a preference for the style or thickness of the lines or shapes.

  8. I am particularly interested in any sharp changes or anomalies in the data trends.'
