initial_prompt: I want a box chart visualizing the Bitcoin Bull-Run Prediction Dataset,
  specifically focusing on the 'Closing Price (USD)' over time. Highlight the overall
  trend and any significant deviations in the pricing data. Include text annotations
  to highlight the range of '24h High (USD)' and '24h Low (USD)'. The chart should
  emphasize the extreme high and low price points to show the volatility. Use color
  highlights to differentiate the most volatile periods. Ensure the visual is intuitive
  to help in understanding the historical price changes and predict future trends.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for the chart?

  2. What specific time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) would you like to
  use for the x-axis?

  3. Should the chart include gridlines for better reference of data points?

  4. Would you like to include a legend to explain color highlights for different
  volatility periods?

  5. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations?

  6. Are there any specific extreme high and low price points you would like emphasized?

  7. Do you prefer the chart background to be a specific color to enhance readability?

  8. Is there a preferred layout format (e.g., landscape or portrait) for the chart?'
