initial_prompt: I need a histogram comparing the driving test results between males
  and females, as well as their average BMIs. Use the 'Gender', 'Driving test result',
  and 'Bmi' columns for this.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the histogram?

  2. Would you prefer the histogram bars to be side-by-side or stacked for comparing
  males and females?

  3. Should the Y-axis display the count or percentage of individuals with specific
  driving test results?

  4. Do you want to include error bars or confidence intervals for average BMIs?

  5. How would you like the data to be grouped on the X-axis (e.g., driving test result
  ranges)?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for labeling the X-axis and Y-axis?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the chart text and labels?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or key to distinguish between males and females
  on the histogram?

  9. Do you want gridlines to be included for easier visual reading of the histogram?

  10. Would you like to see any additional statistical information or metrics on the
  chart?'
