initial_prompt: I need a line chart that compares the driving test results of males
  and females over different dates. The x-axis should show the dates, and the y-axis
  should represent the driving test results. Use different colors or line styles to
  distinguish between males and females. Additionally, highlight significant data
  points with text annotations, like the highest and lowest scores. This will help
  us analyze gender performance trends over time. Include a brief description and
  purpose for the highlights in the chart annotations to provide context. The data
  concerns social science insights on gender differences.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for distinguishing between
  males and females?

  2. Would you like specific line styles (dashed, dotted, solid) to be used in addition
  to colors for better differentiation?

  3. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. Do you want the significant data points (highest and lowest scores) to be highlighted
  with markers or other visual elements?

  5. Should the chart include a legend indicating the colors and line styles used
  for each gender?

  6. Do you have a preferred format for the date display on the x-axis (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY,
  YYYY-MM-DD)?

  7. Would you like any specific title for the chart and axes labels? If so, please
  provide them.

  8. Is there a preferred position for the annotations on the chart (e.g., above the
  data point, to the side)?

  9. Do you want to incorporate grid lines for better readability of the chart?

  10. Are there any additional highlights or annotations you would like to include
  apart from the highest and lowest scores?'
