initial_prompt: I want to create a bar chart comparing the average BMI of males and
  females, using the given data. Highlight the bars to distinguish the two genders
  clearly. Include text annotations to display the average BMI values for males and
  females on top of each bar. Also, add a subtitle mentioning it's for social science
  research. The visualization should clearly illustrate the BMI differences between
  genders, aiding in understanding health trends in different demographics. Ensure
  the chart is easy to read and visually appealing, with a focus on the male vs. female
  comparison.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color preference for the bars representing males
  and females?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size of the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include axis titles? If yes, what would you like them to be?

  5. Is there a preferred position for the legend (e.g., top, right, bottom, left)?

  6. Do you want any specific formatting for the average BMI values in the text annotations
  (e.g., decimal places)?

  7. Is there any particular design style you prefer for the chart (e.g., minimalist,
  detailed, modern)?

  8. Would you like to highlight the gender bars using borders or shadows for additional
  clarity?

  9. Do you want to incorporate any additional labels or annotations besides the average
  BMI values?'
