initial_prompt: I want to create a histogram that shows the distribution of salaries
  among males and females. Can we make separate histograms for each gender and place
  them side by side for easy comparison? Also, let's label the x-axis as 'Salary'
  and the y-axis as 'Frequency'. Please use different colors for males and females
  to distinguish between them. Additionally, provide some basic statistics like mean
  and median salaries for each gender on the chart.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for differentiating between males
  and females in the histograms?

  2. What title would you like for the overall chart?

  3. Would you like any gridlines or background shading on the chart?

  4. Do you prefer the bars in the histogram to be filled or outlined?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and title?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer the bars to be filled.

  5. I am not sure.'
