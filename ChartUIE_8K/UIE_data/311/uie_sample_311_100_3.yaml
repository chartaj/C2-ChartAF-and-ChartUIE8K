initial_prompt: I have a dataset on driving test results categorized by gender, as
  well as BMI, children, salary, region, smoker status, and age. Could you create
  a stacked bar chart that displays the driving test results (y-axis) segmented by
  gender for each date? This will highlight any performance differences in the driving
  test between males and females over the specified dates. Ensure the x-axis shows
  the dates, with stacked bars representing male and female results for each date.
  The chart should help us easily compare test outcomes between genders over time.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have specific preferences for the color scheme used in the chart?

  2. Would you like the chart to include data labels for each bar segment?

  3. Do you prefer a specific format or style for the date labels on the x-axis?

  4. Should the chart have a legend to clarify which color represents which gender?

  5. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the axis labels and
  title?

  6. Would you like any gridlines in the background to aid in reading the chart values?

  7. Do you want the chart to include any annotations or highlights for specific dates
  or results?'
