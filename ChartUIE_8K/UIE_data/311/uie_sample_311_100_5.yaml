initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap based on the dataset provided. The heatmap
  should visualize the average salary distribution across different regions and the
  smoking status of individuals. Additionally, the map should differentiate between
  male and female data points to reflect gender-based income disparities. Ensure the
  heatmap clearly shows the highest and lowest salary areas, the number of children,
  and the age distribution per region. Highlight trends in BMI and driving test results
  by region. Use color gradients to represent varying salary levels and incorporate
  tooltips for detailed information on each data point. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients you prefer for representing
  varying salary levels?

  2. Would you like any particular geographic boundaries or map styles (e.g., political
  regions, natural terrain)?

  3. Are there any specific regions you want to emphasize or focus on more prominently?

  4. Do you have a preference for the type of symbols to use for male and female data
  points?

  5. What level of detail would you like in the tooltips (e.g., should they include
  all data attributes like age, BMI, children)?

  6. Is there a specific range or grouping for the age and children data that you
  prefer to see on the map?'
