initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of distances between
  cities in the Indian Cities Distance Dataset. The chart should show the proportion
  of each unique distance among the total distances recorded. Ensure to label each
  segment with the distance and city pairs it represents. The goal is to highlight
  the varying distances between different origin and destination pairs within India.
  This will help in understanding the spread of distances covered in the dataset and
  identify any major routes that stand out. Include a legend to explain the segments
  clearly.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the segments of the
  donut chart?

  2. Would you prefer the distance labels to include the city names along with the
  numerical values, or just the numerical distances?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for the segment labels and
  legend?

  4. Do you want the segments of the donut chart to be in ascending or descending
  order of distances?

  5. Would you like to highlight the top few (e.g., top 5 or top 10) most common distances
  with distinct colors or labels?

  6. Do you have a preferred title for the donut chart?

  7. Should the legend be placed inside or outside the donut chart?

  8. Are there any other specific annotations or notes you want to include in the
  chart?

  9. Would you like to see percentages next to the distance values in the segment
  labels?

  10. Do you prefer the donut chart to have a specific level of thickness for the
  ring?'
