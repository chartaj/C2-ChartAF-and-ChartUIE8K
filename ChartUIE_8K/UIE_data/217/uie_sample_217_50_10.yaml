initial_prompt: I need a column chart showing the distance between various Indian
  cities from the dataset "Indian Cities Distance Dataset". The X-axis should have
  city pairs (Origin-Destination), and the Y-axis should represent the distance.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the column chart?

  2. Would you like the city pairs on the X-axis to be sorted in any specific order
  (e.g., alphabetically, by distance)?

  3. Do you want grid lines included on the Y-axis for easier distance comparison?

  4. Should the distances on the Y-axis be displayed in any particular unit (e.g.,
  kilometers)?

  5. Do you need labels on each column indicating the exact distance?

  6. Do you have a specific font preference or style for the axis titles and labels?

  7. Would you like to include a title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  8. Do you prefer the columns to have any specific width or should it be auto-adjusted?

  9. Should the chart include a legend?

  10. Do you have any preference on the aspect ratio or overall dimensions of the
  chart?

  11. Would you like to include any annotations or reference lines to highlight specific
  distances or city pairs?'
