initial_prompt: Create a box chart illustrating the distribution of distances between
  Indian cities. Include annotations identifying the shortest and longest distances
  to highlight these outliers. Use highlights to differentiate between distance categories
  (e.g., short, medium, long) for better visual emphasis. The primary purpose is to
  understand the range and variance of travel distances within the dataset. This visualization
  is crucial for transportation and logistics analysis, emphasizing the importance
  of different routes while planning transportation strategies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or specific colors in mind for
  highlighting different distance categories (short, medium, long)?

  2. Would you like the chart to include grid lines for better readability of data
  points?

  3. Should the annotations identifying the shortest and longest distances use a specific
  format or style?

  4. Do you prefer any specific labels or legends for the distance categories?

  5. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like to use for the chart’s
  text annotations and labels?

  6. Do you want a title and/or subtitle for the chart? If so, please provide the
  text you’d like to use.

  7. Should the box chart include axis titles? If yes, what text should be used for
  the X and Y axes?

  8. Would you like to include a summary statistic (e.g., mean, median) on the chart
  alongside the box plot?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, I would like the chart to include grid lines for better readability of data
  points.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not have any specific preference.

  6. Yes, please title the chart "Distribution of Distances Between Indian Cities"
  and use the subtitle "For Transportation and Logistics Analysis".

  7. Yes, the box chart should include axis titles. The X-axis should be labeled "Distance
  Categories" and the Y-axis should be labeled "Distance (km)".

  8. Yes, please include the median on the chart alongside the box plot.'
