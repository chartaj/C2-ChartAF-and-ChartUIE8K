initial_prompt: Visualize a choropleth map showing distances between Indian cities.
  Use color gradients to represent varying distances from the dataset, highlighting
  transportation logistics insights.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the gradients on the choropleth
  map?

  2. Would you like specific distance intervals to be represented by distinct colors
  or a continuous gradient?

  3. Should we include labels for the cities on the map?

  4. Do you prefer any particular map projection for visualizing Indian cities?

  5. Should the map include legends or tooltips to display distance values when hovered
  over specific regions?

  6. Do you have a preference for the range of distances to be visualized (e.g., minimum
  and maximum values)?

  7. Are there any specific cities or regions you would like to highlight more prominently?

  8. Do you want to include any additional annotations or markers on the map?

  9. Would you like to add a title or description to the map to provide context for
