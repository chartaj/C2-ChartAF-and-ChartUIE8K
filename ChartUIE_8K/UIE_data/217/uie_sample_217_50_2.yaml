initial_prompt: Visualize Indian Cities Distance data using a grouped bar chart. Highlight
  differences between distances. Include annotations for key origin-destination pairs
  to emphasize standout distances. The chart should help compare the distances between
  Agra and other cities efficiently.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for distinguishing different
  bars in the grouped bar chart?

  2. Are there any particular origin-destination pairs you want to be highlighted
  with annotations?

  3. Would you like the distances to be displayed directly on the bars, or would you
  prefer them as labels above the bars?

  4. Should the origin ''Agra'' be visually distinct compared to other origins in
  the dataset?

  5. Is there a preferred ordering for the destinations (e.g., ascending or descending
  distance from Agra)?

  6. Are there any specific font style or size preferences for the text annotations
  and labels?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish different groups within the
  bar chart?

  8. Do you prefer a specific layout or orientation for the grouped bars (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal)?'
