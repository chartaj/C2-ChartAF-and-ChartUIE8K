2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the distances between different city pairs.
  Group bars by origin and use different colors for destinations. Highlight the bars
  to differentiate distances effectively. Add text annotations to show exact distances
  on the chart to focus attention on specific values. The chart should help in understanding
  and comparing the travel distances between various Indian cities like Agra to Delhi,
  Lucknow, and Kanpur. This will be useful for logistics and planning transportation
  routes. Provide clear labels and a legend for easy interpretation.
