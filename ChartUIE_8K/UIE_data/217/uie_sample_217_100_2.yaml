initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the distances between different
  city pairs. Group bars by origin and use different colors for destinations. Highlight
  the bars to differentiate distances effectively. Add text annotations to show exact
  distances on the chart to focus attention on specific values. The chart should help
  in understanding and comparing the travel distances between various Indian cities
  like Agra to Delhi, Lucknow, and Kanpur. This will be useful for logistics and planning
  transportation routes. Provide clear labels and a legend for easy interpretation.
