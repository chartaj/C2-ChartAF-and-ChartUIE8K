initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the distance between various cities
  in India. The x-axis should represent the origin cities, and the y-axis should show
  the distance in kilometers. Each line in the chart should represent a destination
  city. Including multiple destination cities in the same chart will help in comparing
  the distances from a single origin. Please use the dataset "../Extra_datas/data/217.csv"
  titled "Indian Cities Distance Dataset" under the "transportation-and-logistics"
  category for this visualization.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors or color schemes for the lines representing
  each destination city?

  2. Do you want gridlines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the origin cities on the x-axis be sorted in any specific order (e.g.,
  alphabetical, by distance)?

  4. Do you prefer labels directly on the lines for each destination city, or should
  there be a legend?

  5. Do you have any specific font preferences for the axis labels and title?

  6. Would you like to include data markers at each data point on the lines?

  7. Is there any specific chart title you would like to use?

  8. Would you prefer the y-axis to start from zero or from the minimum distance value?

  9. Do you want to display the exact distance values on the y-axis or only major
  tick marks?'
