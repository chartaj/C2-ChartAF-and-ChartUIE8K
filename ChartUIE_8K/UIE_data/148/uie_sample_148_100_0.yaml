initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the distribution and frequency
  of Sanskrit words used in Vedic literature across different regions. Annotate key
  data points to highlight regions with the highest occurrence of unique terms. Utilize
  highlights to distinguish between the categories of words (like 'grass'). This will
  help viewers focus on areas rich in specific word occurrences and understand regional
  linguistic diversity in Vedic texts. Make sure the visualization stands out and
  is easy to interpret at a glance, providing immediate insights into linguistic patterns
  and regional prominence.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to use specific symbols or shapes for annotating key data points?

  3. Do you prefer a particular map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson)?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the categories to be highlighted or distinguished
  (e.g., different color coding, transparency levels)?

  5. Do you have preferences for the granularity of regional divisions (e.g., by city,
  state, village)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend that differentiates between the categories
  of words?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the annotations and
  labels?

  8. Do you prefer any specific annotation format (e.g., numerical values, percentages)?

  9. Is there a preferred way to display the frequency of occurrence (e.g., gradient
  shades, intensity of color)?

  10. Do you require any additional contextual information to be included on the map
  (e.g., historical boundaries, modern geographical markers)?'
