initial_prompt: I need a histogram for a study on "Sanskrit Words in Vedic Literature".
  Please use data from "148.csv" to create it. The x-axis should represent the different
  categories of Sanskrit words, and the y-axis should show the frequency of each category.
  Make sure to label the axes accordingly and use distinct colors for each bar. Also,
  include a title for the histogram. This will help visualize the distribution and
  frequency of various Sanskrit words across different categories in Vedic literature.
  Thank you!
