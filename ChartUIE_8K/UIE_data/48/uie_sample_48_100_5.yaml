initial_prompt: Please create a box chart to visualize the variability in the Producer
  Price Index and the number of employed people in the semiconductor industry from
  the dataset provided. Highlight the time period trends and outliers, if any. The
  focus should be on the impact of semiconductor shortages in recent years, so include
  a separate box chart for the years post-2019 if possible. Use different colors to
  represent the Export and Import Price Indexes for semiconductors. This will help
  understand the fluctuations better amidst the ongoing semiconductor shortage issues.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between Export
  and Import Price Indexes?

  2. Should the box charts be displayed on a single plot for comparison, or would
  you prefer them to be side-by-side?

  3. Any specific time interval labels you would like to use (e.g., months, quarters,
  years)?

  4. Would you like to include any specific labels or annotations for outliers?

  5. Is there a preferred style for the boxes and whiskers (e.g., dashed lines, solid
  lines)?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s background (e.g., white,
  light gray)?

  8. Would you like to include any specific titles or subtitles for the charts?

  9. Do you prefer any particular font sizes or styles for the chart text (e.g., axis
  labels, title, legend)?

  10. Are there any specific legend positions you prefer (e.g., top-right, bottom-left)?

  11. Should the y-axis be displayed in a log scale or a regular linear scale?

  12. Are there any additional data points or markers you would like to highlight
  on the chart?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would prefer them to be side-by-side.
