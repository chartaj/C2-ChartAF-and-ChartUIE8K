initial_prompt: Visualize the semiconductor industry trends from 1985 using a Bubble
  chart. Plot "DATE" on the x-axis and "Producer Price Index(By Industry in $)" on
  the y-axis. Use bubble size to represent "No. of employed peoples in semiconductor
  industry". Highlight significant data shifts such as peaks or valleys in the trends.
  Add annotations to explain unusual data points, like missing values in the "Export
  Price Index(End Use of semiconductors)" or "Import Price Index(in $ End Use of semiconductors)".
  This will help emphasize changes in employment and price indices over time amidst
  semiconductor shortages.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubble chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend that explains what the bubble sizes represent?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the annotations?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, or do you prefer a
  cleaner look?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the format of the date on the x-axis (e.g.,
  month-year, year only)?

  6. How would you like the significant data shifts (peaks and valleys) to be highlighted?
  (e.g., color change, different bubble shapes)

  7. Should the annotations for missing values in the "Export Price Index" and "Import
  Price Index" be in a specific format?

  8. Do you want a title for the chart? If so, what should the title be?

  9. Would you like the y-axis to have a specific range or scale (e.g., logarithmic)
  to better display the data?

  10. Do you have any preferences for the inclusion of trend lines or other statistical
  elements?'
