initial_prompt: Create a line chart showcasing the trends in the semiconductor industry
  from 1985 onwards, including the Producer and Export Price Indices, Import Price
  Index, and employment figures. Highlight any gaps or missing data points.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for the different indices and employment
  figures on the line chart?

  2. Do you have a preference for the style of line (solid, dashed, dotted) for each
  metric?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked with symbols (e.g., circles, squares)
  on the line chart?

  4. Should missing data points be highlighted in a specific way (e.g., different
  color, marker)?

  5. Do you prefer including a legend directly inside the chart or outside the chart?

  6. Would you like to have grid lines for better readability of the data trends?

  7. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the axis labels and title?

  8. Do you have a specific format for the date axis (e.g., monthly, yearly)?

  9. Would you like to include annotations or notes for significant events or gaps
  in the data?

  10. Are there any specific axis ranges or scales you want to set for the chart (e.g.,
  logarithmic scale for price indices)?'
