initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart highlighting key indices such as Producer Price
  Index and employed people in the semiconductor industry. Use annotations to emphasize
  missing data points and semiconductors' export/import indexes. Highlight significant
  changes to address the semiconductor shortage.
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for differentiating the key indices\
  \ in the bubble chart?\n2. Do you have a specific preference for the size scaling\
  \ of bubbles in the chart?\n3. Do you prefer the chart to be oriented in a specific\
  \ way (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?\n4. What type of annotations do you prefer\
  \ for emphasizing missing data points and significant changes?\n5. Do you have any\
  \ preference for the background and gridline styling of the bubble chart?\n6. Should\
  \ any specific date range be focused on or highlighted within the chart?\n7. Would\
  \ you like to include specific tooltip information when hovering over the bubbles?\n\
  8. Is there a preference for how the axis labels and titles should be formatted?\n\
  9. Do you want any specific legends or keys to be included in the chart? \n10. Should\
  \ the chart include a trend line or any additional markers to show significant changes\
  \ more clearly?"
