initial_prompt: Please create a histogram visualizing the distribution of the "Quality"
  of apples from the provided data. Highlight the bars representing "good" and "bad"
  qualities differently, perhaps using distinct colors. Include data-driven text annotations
  showing the count of apples in each quality category on top of each bar. The purpose
  of this visualization is to easily discern the proportion of good vs. bad quality
  apples. Additionally, make sure the histogram is easy to understand at a glance
  and provides a clear overview of apple quality in relation to other attributes such
  as Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness, Ripeness, and Acidity.
questions: '1. What specific colors would you prefer for highlighting the "good" and
  "bad" quality categories in the histogram?

  2. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations displaying
  the count of apples in each quality category?

  3. Would you like to include a title and axis labels for the histogram? If yes,
  could you provide the specific text for them?

  4. Is there a specific way you would like the data to be formatted or represented
  in the text annotations (e.g., number formatting, decimal places)?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the layout or orientation of the histogram
  (e.g., vertical or horizontal bars)?

  6. Should any additional information or context be included in the histogram to
  enhance understanding for the audience? If so, what information would you like to
  add?'
answers: '1. For "good" quality apples, I prefer green, and for "bad" quality apples,
  I prefer red.

  2. I am not sure about the font style or size for the text annotations.

  3. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. The title should be "Distribution
  of Apple Quality," the x-axis label should be "Quality," and the y-axis label should
  be "Count of Apples."

  4. I do not have a specific preference for how the data is formatted in the text
  annotations.

  5. I am not sure about the layout or orientation of the histogram.

  6. I do not know if any additional information is needed.'
