initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the Quality distribution of apples,
  highlighting 'good' and 'bad' categories, focusing on the frequency of each quality
  classification. Include annotations for total counts and any interesting outliers.
  Use text annotations and highlights to clearly distinguish between categories, making
  the interpretation straightforward.
questions: "1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the 'good' and\
  \ 'bad' categories in the histogram?\n2. Would you like the legend to be displayed\
  \ on the chart, and if so, where should it be positioned?\n3. Do you have a specific\
  \ font style or size preference for text annotations?\n4. Should the histogram include\
  \ grid lines for easier interpretation of frequencies?\n5. Do you prefer vertical\
  \ or horizontal bars for the histogram?\n6. Would you like a specific title and\
  \ axis labels for the histogram? If so, please provide the text.\n7. Are there any\
  \ specific outliers you are interested in highlighting, or should all outliers be\
  \ marked?\n8. Do you have any preferences for the size and positioning of the annotations\
  \ for total counts and outliers? \n9. Should the frequency counts be displayed within\
  \ the bars, above the bars, or alongside them?\n10. Would you like to include any\
  \ additional information or notes in the chart for context?"
