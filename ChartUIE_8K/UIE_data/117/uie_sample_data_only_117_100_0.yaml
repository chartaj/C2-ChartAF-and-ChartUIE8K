09_answers: '1. For "good" quality apples, I prefer green, and for "bad" quality apples,
  I prefer red.

  2. I am not sure about the font style or size for the text annotations.

  3. Yes, please include a title and axis labels. The title should be "Distribution
  of Apple Quality," the x-axis label should be "Quality," and the y-axis label should
  be "Count of Apples."

  4. I do not have a specific preference for how the data is formatted in the text
