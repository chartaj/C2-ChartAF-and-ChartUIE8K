initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the "Apple Quality" data with a box chart. The
  chart should display the distribution of Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness, Juiciness,
  and Ripeness. We need boxes for each attribute, showing their ranges and central
  tendencies. The x-axis would represent the attributes, and the y-axis would represent
  their values. Ensure to highlight outliers and specify the corresponding apple quality,
  distinguishing between 'good' and 'bad' apples where possible. This can help in
  identifying which attributes impact the perceived quality of apples.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Do you want to include grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  3. Should the outliers be labeled or just highlighted?

  4. Are there any specific labels or annotations you want on the chart?

  5. How would you like the ''good'' and ''bad'' apple qualities to be distinguished
  (e.g., different colors, patterns)?

  6. Do you prefer using any specific font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Would you like to add a legend to help interpret the colors or patterns used
  in the chart?

  8. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart''s title and axis titles?

  9. Is there any additional data or information you want to include in tooltips or
  hover effects?

  10. Should the y-axis be set to a specific range or adjusted automatically based
  on the data?'
