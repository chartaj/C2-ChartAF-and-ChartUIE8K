initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing 'Sweetness' versus 'Size' over 'A_id'.

  data points?

  or placement for the text annotations in mind?

  3. Is there a particular style for the lines (solid, dashed, etc.) or markers (circle,
  square, etc.) you would prefer?

  4. What level of detail do you require in the axis labels and titles?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to indicate what the highlighted points represent?

  6. Do you have a specific preference for the grid lines or background of the chart?

  7. Are there any specific ranges or limits you want to set for the ''Size'' or ''Sweetness''
  axes?'
