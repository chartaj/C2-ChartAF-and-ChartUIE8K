initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot to visualize the N Primes Based RSA Variant
  Analysis for a cryptocurrency-and-blockchain context. X-axis should be the number
  of bits (nbits) and the Y-axis should be the encryption time (encrTime). Use different
  colors for different message sizes (msgsize). Make sure to display data points clearly,
  and include axes labels and a legend indicating the message sizes.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing different
  message sizes?

  2. Is there a specific range for the X-axis (number of bits) and Y-axis (encryption
  time) that you would like to set?

  3. Would you like the data points to be represented in a specific shape or size?

  4. Do you want the legend placed in a specific location on the chart?

  5. Should gridlines be included in the chart for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  7. Do you have any preferred font styles or sizes for the axes labels and legend?

  8. Would you like the axes to be scaled logarithmically instead of linearly?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I am not sure about the specific range for the X-axis and Y-axis.

  3. I do not know if I want the data points to be represented in a specific shape
  or size.

  4. I do not have a preference for the legend location.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines in the chart for better readability.

  6. No, I do not have a specific title in mind for the chart.

  7. I do not have a preference for the font styles or sizes for the axes labels and
  legend.

  8. I am not sure if the axes should be scaled logarithmically or linearly.'
