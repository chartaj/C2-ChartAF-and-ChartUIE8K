initial_prompt: I need a column chart to visualize the performance of different nbits
  values in an N Primes Based RSA Variant. The x-axis should have 'nbits' values (8
  in sample), and the y-axis should represent 'spawnTime', 'encrTime', 'decrTime',
  and 'memory'. Each of these should be displayed as separate bars for each 'nbits'
  value, enabling a comparison between them. Highlight differences in times and memory
  to understand performance variations based on 'nbits'. Please make sure the chart
  is clear and all values are correct. This data is crucial for cryptocurrency and
  blockchain analysis.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the bars?

  2. Would you prefer the bars representing each time and memory metric to be grouped
  or stacked?

  3. Should there be different patterns or textures to differentiate between the bars
  for each metric?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you would like used for the axis labels
  and titles?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines for easier comparison, or keep the chart
  minimalistic?

  6. Should each bar have data labels to show exact values, or is it enough to interpret
  values based on the y-axis?

  7. Is there a preferred order for how the metrics ''spawnTime'', ''encrTime'', ''decrTime'',
  and ''memory'' should appear within each nbits group?

  8. Do you want a legend to distinguish between the different metrics? If yes, any
  specific placement for the legend?

  9. Are there any specific visual elements you would like to include to highlight
  significant differences in data, such as annotations or callouts?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference.

  2. Grouped bars would be better to compare each metric more clearly.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Including grid lines would be helpful for easier comparison.

  6. Yes, please include data labels to show exact values.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I have no specific placement preference.

  9. I am not sure.'
