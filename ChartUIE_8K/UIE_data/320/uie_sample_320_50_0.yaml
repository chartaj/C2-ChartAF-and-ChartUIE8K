initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart showing the encryption and decryption times
  for different message sizes. Highlight the encryption times. Incorporate text annotations
  for key data points and include a title reflecting the n primes based RSA variant.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the encryption
  times?

  2. Should the chart include grid lines for better readability, and if so, in which
  direction (horizontal, vertical, or both)?

  3. Do you have a particular font style or size preference for the text annotations
  and title?

  4. Would you like to include labels on the x and y axes, and if so, what specific

  5. Do you have a preferred position for the legend of the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Should the bars be displayed in a specific order based on message size or another
  attribute?
