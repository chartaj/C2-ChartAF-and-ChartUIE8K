initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of 'nbits',
  'nprimes', and 'msgsize'. This chart will help analyze the N Primes Based RSA Variant
  within cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. Use data-driven text annotations
  to highlight significant values and draw attention to specific points, like maximum
  and minimum 'encrTime' and 'decrTime'. Highlights should be used to emphasize elements
  with markedly high or low times. Make sure the chart provides valuable insights
  for researchers focusing on security and performance aspects of blockchain technologies.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the stacked bar chart?

  2. Would you like the text annotations to be shown inside or outside the bars?

  3. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the text annotations?

  4. How would you like the highlighted elements with high or low values to be represented
  (e.g., different colors, patterns, borders)?

  5. Do you prefer a specific axis scaling (e.g., logarithmic vs linear) for the ''encrTime''
  and ''decrTime'' values?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines or not?

  7. Do you have a preferred positioning for the legend (e.g., top, bottom, right,
  left)?

  8. Should the chart include titles and subtitles, and if so, what should they be?

  9. Would you like tooltips to display additional information when hovering over
  specific bars?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the width and height of the bars in
  the stacked bar chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color palette.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Different colors would be great.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include titles and subtitles. The title could be "Distribution of
  ''nbits'', ''nprimes'', and ''msgsize'' in N Primes Based RSA Variant" and the subtitle
  could be "Security and Performance Analysis in Cryptocurrency and Blockchain Applications".

  9. I have no specific preference.

  10. I do not have any specific preferences for the width and height of the bars.'
