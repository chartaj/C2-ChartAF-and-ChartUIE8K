  descending by ''nbits'')?

  5. Would you like to include error bars to show variability in ''encrTime'' and
  ''decrTime'' values?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, or is it enough to use distinct colors for
  ''encrTime'' and ''decrTime'' columns?

  7. Do you want to add axis titles and overall chart title?

  8. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the chart text elements?
