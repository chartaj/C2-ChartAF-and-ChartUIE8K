initial_prompt: Please create a box chart visualizing the variations in 'spawnTime',
  'encrTime', and 'decrTime' from the given RSA variant analysis dataset. Highlight
  the distribution and outliers of these times, categorized by 'nprimes' and 'msgsize'.
  Including all columns will help in understanding computational overhead. Keep the
  visualization insightful and practical for analyzing performance trade-offs in cryptocurrency
  and blockchain applications.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the box chart?

  2. How would you like the categories ''nprimes'' and ''msgsize'' to be displayed
  or differentiated in the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific order for the variables ''spawnTime'', ''encrTime'',
  and ''decrTime'' on the x-axis?

  4. Is there a particular way you''d like the outliers to be highlighted in the chart?

  5. Would you like to include any specific statistical measures or annotations (e.g.,
  median, quartiles) in the box chart?

  6. Do you have preferences on the chart''s background or gridline style?

  7. Should the chart include a title and labels for each axis? If so, do you have
  specific wording for them?

  8. Would you like to include a legend or key for better understanding of the different
  categories and variables?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the categories ''nprimes'' and ''msgsize'' to be differentiated
  using different colors or shades.

  3. I do not have a specific order for the variables ''spawnTime'', ''encrTime'',
  and ''decrTime'' on the x-axis.

  4. I am not sure, could you highlight them clearly?

  5. No specific preference, but including the median would be helpful.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please include a title and labels for each axis. The title could be "RSA
  Computation Times by nprimes and msgsize", and the axis labels could be "Time (ms)"
  for the y-axis and "Computation Phases" for the x-axis.

  8. Yes, including a legend or key would be helpful for better understanding.
