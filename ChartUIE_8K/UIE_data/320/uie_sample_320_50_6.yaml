initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart visualizing the relationship between `nbits`,
  `nprimes`, and `memory` usage from the N Primes Based RSA Variant Analysis data.
  Highlight spawnTimes using color.
questions: "1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to highlight\
  \ 'spawnTime'?\n2. Would you like to include specific axis labels and titles for\
  \ the chart?\n3. Do you prefer a particular size scale for the bubbles based on\
  \ the 'memory' usage?\n4. Are there any specific ranges or limits for the axes that\
  \ you want to set?\n5. Would you like to include a legend for the color coding of\
  \ 'spawnTime'?\n6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text and labels\
  \ on the chart?\n7. Would you like gridlines to be included or excluded in the background\
  \ of the chart?\n8. Is there a specific format for displaying the numeric values\
  \ on the axes (e.g., decimals, scientific notation)?\n9. Do you prefer any specific\
  \ style for the chart background (e.g., white, light grey)? \n10. Are there any\
  \ additional annotations or labels you would like to add to specific data points\
  \ on the chart?"
