initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart analyzing 'msgsize' vs 'encrTime', 'decrTime',
  and 'memory' for different 'nbits' and 'nprimes'. Annotate key points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the grouped bar chart?

  2. Do you want each ''msgsize'' group to be represented by a specific color or pattern?

  3. How would you prefer the bars within each group to be distinguished (shades of
  the same color, different colors, patterns)?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines or background shading to enhance readability?

  5. What level of detail would you like in the annotations for key points (e.g.,
  specific values, percentages)?

  6. Would you prefer labels on the bars themselves, or is a legend sufficient?

  7. Should the chart include error bars or confidence intervals if applicable?

  8. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart''s title and axis labels?

  9. Would you like the chart to include any specific markers or highlights for critical
  data points?

  10. Should the chart include a secondary y-axis if the range of values for ''encrTime'',
  ''decrTime'', and ''memory'' differs significantly?'
