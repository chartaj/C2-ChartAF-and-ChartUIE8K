initial_prompt: 'Please create a stacked column chart using the "Indian Liver Patient
  Records" dataset. The x-axis should represent the "Gender" column (Male and Female).
  For each gender group, stack the counts of different bilirubin levels ("Total_Bilirubin":
  low [0-1], moderate [1-3], high [3-10], very high [>10]). The y-axis should show
  the patient count. This visualization will help to understand the distribution of
  bilirubin levels across genders in liver patients. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret.
  Thank you!'
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the different bilirubin
  levels (low, moderate, high, very high)?

  2. Would you like to add any specific title to the chart?

  3. Do you want grid lines to be displayed on the chart for easier reading?

  4. Should there be a legend to explain what each stack color represents?

  5. Do you have preferences for font style and size for axis labels and the chart
  title?

  6. Would you like to include data labels on each stack within the columns to show
  exact counts?

  7. Is there a preference for the order in which the bilirubin levels are stacked
  (e.g., from low to very high or vice versa)?

  8. Do you have a preference for the format and labels for the x-axis and y-axis?

  9. Would you prefer the bars to have specific spacing between them?

  10. Should there be any specific annotations or reference lines (e.g., average bilirubin
  levels) added to the chart?'
