initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the average Total Bilirubin
  levels across different age groups from the Indian Liver Patient Records dataset.
  Use the Age column to create age ranges (e.g., 0-20, 21-40, 41-60, 61+). The Y-axis
  should represent the average Total Bilirubin levels, while the X-axis should show
  the different age ranges. This will help in understanding how Total Bilirubin levels
  vary with age among liver patients. Include labels and a legend for clarity. Thank
  you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the column chart?

  2. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  3. What format would you like for the age range labels on the X-axis?
