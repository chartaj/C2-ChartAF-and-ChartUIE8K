initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the Indian Liver Patient Records.
  Plot Age on the x-axis and Alkaline_Phosphotase, Alamine_Aminotransferase, and Aspartate_Aminotransferase
  levels on the y-axis for comparison across ages. Use different colored lines for
  each of the three enzymes to distinguish them easily. Make sure the chart clearly
  shows trends or patterns over the different ages. Also, include a legend to identify
  each enzyme. The chart should help in understanding how these enzyme levels vary
  with age among patients with liver conditions.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme of the lines
  representing each enzyme?

  2. What title would you like to give to the chart?

  3. Are there any specific labels you would like to use for the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Would you prefer a specific font style or size for the text elements in the chart?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the format of the legend (e.g., position on the
  chart)?

  6. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you would like for the chart?

  7. Are there any annotations or specific data points you want highlighted in the
  chart?

  8. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If yes, should they be for both axes or just
  one?

  9. Are there any specific ranges or scales you want to be used for the x-axis and
  y-axis? For instance, should the y-axes be logarithmic or linear scales?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific preferences for the color scheme.

  2. I would like the title to be "Enzyme Levels vs. Age in Indian Liver Patients".

  3. X-axis: "Age (years)" and Y-axis: "Enzyme Levels (U/L)".

  4. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  5. I have no specific preference for the format of the legend.

  6. I do not know about the size or aspect ratio.

  7. I do not have any specific data points to highlight.

  8. Yes, please include gridlines for both axes.

  9. Use a linear scale for both axes.'
