initial_prompt: I need a treemap chart to visualize the Indian Liver Patient Records
  dataset. The treemap should show the distribution of liver patients based on different
  attributes. Use the 'Gender' as the primary category, and within each gender, split
  by 'Age' groups. Each age group should then be further split by levels of 'Total_Bilirubin'.
  Ensure the sizes of the rectangles represent the count of records in each category,
  and use color coding to distinguish between the levels of 'Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio'.
  Make it interactive to allow drill-downs.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for distinguishing the levels of
  ''Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio''?

  2. Would you like specific age group ranges to be used, or should the age groups
  be automatically determined?

  3. Do you prefer a certain order for displaying the categories (e.g., sorting by
  age in ascending/descending order)?

  4. Are there any specific fonts or styles you would like for the labels and legends?

  5. How detailed should the labels be (e.g., include counts, percentages, or both)?

  6. Do you have any preferred width-to-height ratio for the treemap to ensure it
  fits well in a particular layout?

  7. Would you like any specific titles or annotations included in the treemap chart?

  8. Are there any particular themes or color palettes you prefer for the overall
  design of the treemap?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about any specific color preferences for distinguishing
  the levels of ''Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio''.

  2. I do not know; please use automatically determined age groups.

  3. I prefer sorting the categories by age in ascending order.

  4. I do not have specific font or style preferences for the labels and legends.

  5. Please include both counts and percentages in the labels.

  6. I am not sure about the width-to-height ratio; please choose what fits best.

  7. I would like a title that clearly indicates that this is a treemap of the Indian
  Liver Patient Records.

  8. I have no specific preferences for themes or color palettes; please use what
  looks best for clarity and aesthetics.'
