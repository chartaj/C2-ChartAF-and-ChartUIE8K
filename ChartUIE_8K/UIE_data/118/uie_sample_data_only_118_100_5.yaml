  Indian Liver Patient Records dataset. Use the 'Gender' column data to segment the
  pie chart into 'Male' and 'Female' categories, displaying their relative proportions.
  This visualization should help in understanding the gender distribution among liver
  patients in the dataset. Make sure to label each segment with the percentage of
  the total dataset it represents. Use distinct colors for each gender to make the
  chart visually clear. This will help in quick and effective analysis of gender-based
