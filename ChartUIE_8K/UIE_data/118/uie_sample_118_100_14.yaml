initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the distribution of patients'
  age groups in the Indian Liver Patient Records dataset. The x-axis should represent
  different age groups (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, ..., 61-70, 71+), and the y-axis should
  represent the count of patients in each age group. Additionally, use different colors
  to distinguish between male and female patients within each age group. This will
  help to better understand the age and gender distribution of liver patients in the
  dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for distinguishing between male
  and female patients?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Would you like the age groups to have custom labels, or should we use the default
  ranges (e.g., 0-10, 11-20, etc.)?

  4. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the chart labels and titles?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific location (e.g., top, bottom, left,
  right)?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be only for the y-axis,
  x-axis, or both?

  7. Is there a specific format you prefer for displaying the count values on the
  y-axis (e.g., integers, thousands with comma separators)?

  8. Do you need any additional annotations or markers on the chart (e.g., highlighting
  a specific age group)?

  9. Should the bars be displayed with specific spacing between age groups or clustered
  tightly together?

  10. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the bars (vertical or horizontal)?'
