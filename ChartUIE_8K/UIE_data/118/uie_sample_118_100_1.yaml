initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the liver patient records.
  Use different colors to distinguish between male and female patients. Highlight
  "Total_Bilirubin" and "Direct_Bilirubin" levels, focusing attention on abnormal
  values. Annotate the highest "Alkaline_Phosphotase" readings to highlight potential
  liver issues. The chart should emphasize key health indicators for easier comparison,
  especially in relation to gender. This visualization aids in understanding gender
  differences in liver health metrics and identifying critical values that might need
  medical attention. Ensure annotations and highlights draw attention to the most
  significant data points.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between male
  and female patients?

  2. Would you like a specific threshold to be used for highlighting ''Total_Bilirubin''
  and ''Direct_Bilirubin'' levels as abnormal?

  3. Are there any additional metrics or values that you want to be annotated or highlighted
  on the chart?

  4. How would you like the annotations for high ''Alkaline_Phosphotase'' readings
  to be displayed (e.g., text box, arrow)?

  5. Do you have any preferences for the layout or style of the grouped bar chart?

  6. Would you like to include any specific labels or legends to enhance clarity?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about the specific threshold for ''Total_Bilirubin'' and ''Direct_Bilirubin''.

  3. I do not know if there are any additional metrics or values to annotate or highlight.

  4. I think using arrows for the annotations of high ''Alkaline_Phosphotase'' readings
  would be good.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the layout or style of the grouped bar
  chart.

  6. Yes, including specific labels or legends to enhance clarity would be helpful.'
