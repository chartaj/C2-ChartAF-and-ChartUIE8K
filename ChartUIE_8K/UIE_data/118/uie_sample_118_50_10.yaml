  the varying levels of Total Bilirubin from the Indian Liver Patient dataset.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for different age groups and genders?

  2. Do you have a specific layout preference for the treemap, such as a squarified
  or slice-and-dice layout?

  3. Would you like labels to display the actual values of Total Bilirubin within
  each treemap segment?

  4. Should the treemap have a legend to explain the color coding or other visual
  elements?

  5. Do you want to include any specific fonts or font sizes for the text within the
  treemap?

  6. Would you prefer a certain level of granularity for age groups (e.g., grouped
  by decade, by individual year)?

  7. Are there any particular design elements or styles you would like to avoid or
  include in the treemap?'
