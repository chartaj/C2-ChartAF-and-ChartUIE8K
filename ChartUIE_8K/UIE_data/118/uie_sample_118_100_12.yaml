initial_prompt: Please create a comprehensive table chart showing the liver patient
  records. Include columns for Age, Gender, Total Bilirubin, Direct Bilirubin, Alkaline
  Phosphotase, Alamine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, Total Proteins,
  Albumin, Albumin and Globulin Ratio, and Dataset. Highlight any missing values in
