initial_prompt: I need a dot plot visualizing the Indian Liver Patient Records. Specifically,
  I'd like dots to represent individual records, categorized by Gender. Use Age on
  the X-axis and Total_Bilirubin on the Y-axis. Additionally, color-code the dots
  based on the Dataset column to distinguish different groups within the dataset.
  Make sure to include a legend. This will help to identify any potential correlation
  between age, bilirubin levels, and gender in the liver patient records. Please ensure
  the plot is clear and easy to interpret.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the title of the chart?

  2. Would you like to customize the axis labels or use the default labels derived
  from the data attributes?

  3. Do you prefer a specific color palette for color-coding the dots based on the
  Dataset column?

  4. How do you want the legend to be displayed, and is there any specific information
  you want to include in the legend?

  5. Are there any specific formatting or styling preferences for the dots (e.g.,
  size, shape, border)?

  6. Would you like gridlines on the background for better readability of the chart?

  7. Do you want to include any reference lines or markers to highlight specific value
  ranges or thresholds?

  8. Is there any specific font style or size preference for the labels, title, or
  legend?

  9. Would you prefer to display data labels or tooltips with specific information
  on hover for each dot?

  10. Are there any additional annotations or notes you would like to add to the chart?'
