initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of Gender in the
  Indian Liver Patient Records dataset. Use the 'Gender' column data to segment the
  pie chart into 'Male' and 'Female' categories, displaying their relative proportions.
  This visualization should help in understanding the gender distribution among liver
  patients in the dataset. Make sure to label each segment with the percentage of
  the total dataset it represents. Use distinct colors for each gender to make the
  chart visually clear. This will help in quick and effective analysis of gender-based
  trends in liver patient demographics.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred colors for representing ''Male'' and ''Female''
  categories in the pie chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels and percentages on the
  pie chart?

  3. Do you want a legend included in the pie chart, or is it sufficient to label
  each segment directly?

  4. Do you have a preferred title for the pie chart? If so, what is it?

  5. Would you like to include any additional text or annotations within the pie chart?

  6. Do you prefer the pie chart to be in a specific orientation (clockwise or counterclockwise)?

  7. Do you want the segments of the pie chart to be separated or in a 3D style for
  emphasis, or should they be shown in a traditional flat format?'
