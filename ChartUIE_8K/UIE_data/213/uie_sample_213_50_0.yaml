  and URLs (e.g., font size, color, style)?

  4. Should the co-ordinates and URLs be displayed inside the cells or as tooltips?

  5. Are there any specific formatting preferences for the axis labels (e.g., font
  type, size, orientation)?

  a preference for their appearance?

  7. Do you have any preference for the ordering of regions and course names on the
