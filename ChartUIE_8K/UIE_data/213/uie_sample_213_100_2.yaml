initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of golf course regions
  across New York State parks. Highlight unique regions to emphasize their distribution
  range and gaps. Annotate significant values like outliers to focus attention. Use
  data such as 'State Park', 'Course Name', 'Region', and 'County'. This will provide
  insights into regional concentration and identify underserved areas. Ensure that
  the chart is clear and aids in understanding the spread and density of golf courses
  within different state parks, helping in regional planning for sports and recreation.
  Avoid clutter to maintain readability.
