02_initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing NYS Golf Courses from the provided
  dataset. The x-axis should represent the Longitude, and the y-axis should represent
  the Latitude. Each point on the scatter plot will represent a specific golf course,
  with different colors used to differentiate courses in various State Parks. Tooltips
  on the scatter points should display the State Park and Course Name for better context.
  Please ensure the map is plotted accurately with proper longitude and latitude scales
  and labeled axes. This will help in visualizing the geographic distribution of the
  golf courses across New York State.
