initial_prompt: Create a bar chart for the Reddit Vaccine Myths data with annotations
  on the 'score' axis to highlight specific scores for each title. Include elements
  like the title of the post, score, ID, and created date. Use different colors to
  distinguish varying scores and visually emphasize posts with higher scores. This
  visualization should help us quickly identify which posts garnered significant attention
  and had the most engagement regarding vaccine myths. Ensure that the chart is easy
  to interpret and effectively draws attention to the most important data points.
