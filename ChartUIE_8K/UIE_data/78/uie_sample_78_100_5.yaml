initial_prompt: I need a Heatmap that visualizes the correlation between the number
  of comments, scores, and unique values in our data about Reddit vaccine myths discussions.
  I want to understand how these metrics influence each other. The dataset includes
  columns like 'title', 'score', 'id', 'url', 'comms_num', 'created', 'body', and
  'timestamp.â€™ The timeframe for the data spans February 2021. Emphasize the relationship
  between these variables to identify trends or insights in the discussion patterns
  about vaccine myths across Reddit forums. This will help us in analyzing user engagement
  and post popularity.
questions: '1. Do you have any color scheme preferences for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include annotations to show exact correlation values on the
  heatmap?

  3. Should the correlation values be standardized or normalized before visualizing?

  4. Do you prefer a specific range or scale for the heatmap (e.g., 0 to 1, -1 to
  1)?

  5. Would you like to include labels or legends for better interpretability?

  6. Should we categorize the correlation strength (e.g., strong, moderate, weak)
  on the heatmap?

  7. Do you want to include any specific titles, subtitles, or captions on the chart?

  8. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text on the heatmap?

  9. Should the heatmap include any grid lines or borders?'
