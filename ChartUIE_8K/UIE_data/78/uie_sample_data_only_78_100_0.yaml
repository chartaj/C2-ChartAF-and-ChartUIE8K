  1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I''m not sure, maybe place them near the data points where the maximum and minimum
  scores occur.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to identify each "title" by color.

  4. I have no specific preference for the style and format of the axis labels.

  5. I am not sure, just the maximum and minimum scores should be fine for now.

  6. I do not know, no specific preferences for the font style or size.

  7. Yes, please include grid lines for better readability, but I am not sure about
  the style.
