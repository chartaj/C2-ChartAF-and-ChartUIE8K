initial_prompt: Create a line chart to show the trend of "score" over "created" time
  for different "title" entries. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight the
  maximum and minimum scores in the dataset. Utilize highlights to distinguish between
  different titles by using varying colors. The chart should help analyze the pattern
  or trend in scores of different posts over time and focus on data concerning COVID-19
  seen through Reddit posts. Make sure the x-axis represents the timestamp, and the
  y-axis represents the score. Annotate critical points to draw attention to specific
  events and trends.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette or specific colors you would
  like to use to differentiate between different "title" entries?

  2. Where would you like the data-driven text annotations for the maximum and minimum
  scores to be placed?

  3. Would you like the chart to include a legend to identify each "title" by color?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style and format of the x-axis and y-axis
  labels?

  5. Are there any specific events or trends that you want to be annotated apart from
  the maximum and minimum scores?

  6. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations and axis
  labels?

  7. Should grid lines be included in the background of the chart for better readability?
  If yes, do you have a preference for the style of the grid lines?'

  1. I do not have a specific preference for the color palette.

  2. I''m not sure, maybe place them near the data points where the maximum and minimum
  scores occur.

  5. I am not sure, just the maximum and minimum scores should be fine for now.
