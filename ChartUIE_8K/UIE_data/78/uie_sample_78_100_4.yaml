initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap using the dataset from 'Reddit Vaccine
  Myths'. I want to visualize regions with the highest number of Reddit posts discussing
  vaccine myths. Include colors to represent varying densities of posts, from low
  (cool colors) to high (warm colors). Ensure the heatmap highlights countries or
  areas most engaged in these discussions. Use the 'created' column to filter data
  by a specific time period, such as the last six months. Also include a legend to
  explain the color grading and any prominent hotspots. The map should be interactive
  if possible.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color palette used for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include specific geographic regions or countries in the focus
  of the heatmap?

  3. Should the legend include a breakdown of specific density ranges and their corresponding
  colors?

  4. Would you prefer the time period filter to be adjustable or fixed to the last
  six months?

  5. Do you have a specific style or format preference for the legend?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about the color palette, but it should clearly show the
  density from low to high.

  2. I have no specific preference, just highlight regions with the most posts.

  3. Yes, the legend should include a breakdown of specific density ranges and their
  corresponding colors.

  4. Fixed to the last six months is fine.

  5. I do not know, any clear style will work for the legend.'
