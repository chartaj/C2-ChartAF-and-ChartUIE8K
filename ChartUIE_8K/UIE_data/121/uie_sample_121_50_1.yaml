initial_prompt: Create a histogram visualizing total emissions from food production.
  Highlight bars with high emissions in a different color and add text annotations
  for the top three highest values. This helps identify most impactful foods.
questions: "1. What color scheme do you prefer for the histogram?\n2. Do you have\
  \ a preference for the color used to highlight bars with high emissions?\n3. Where\
  \ would you like the text annotations for the top three highest values to be placed\
  \ (e.g., above the bars, inside the bars)?\n4. Would you like any specific font\
  \ style or size for the text annotations?\n5. Do you have a preference for the bin\
  \ width or number of bins in the histogram?\n6. Should the x-axis labels be rotated\
  \ for better readability?\n7. Would you like any gridlines to be included in the\
  \ chart for better reference points?\n8. Is there a particular title you would like\
  \ for the histogram?\n9. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis titles?\
