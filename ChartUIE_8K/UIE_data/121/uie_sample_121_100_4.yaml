initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize the environmental impact
  of food production. Use the "Food product" on the X-axis and the various emission
  categories like "Land use change," "Animal Feed," "Farm," "Processing," "Transport,"
  "Packaging," "Retail," etc., stacked on the Y-axis. Ensure each food product's total
  emissions are clearly reflected in the chart. The data should highlight the different
  ecological footprints for wheat, maize, and barley. The chart should give a clear
  comparison of how each factor contributes to overall emissions. Consider the missing
  values in the dataset, especially focusing on the available data points.
questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for different emission categories on
  the chart?

  2. Do you have a preferred order for stacking the emission categories on the Y-axis?

  3. Would you like grid lines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  4. Should the Y-axis be displayed with absolute values or percentages?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the labels and legends?

  6. Would you like to include data labels on the individual stacks to show the exact
  values?

  7. Do you prefer a specific style for the chart borders or outlines?

  8. Is there any specific title or subtitle you want for the chart?

  9. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, where would you like it to be positioned?

  10. How would you like to handle the visualization of missing values in the dataset?'
