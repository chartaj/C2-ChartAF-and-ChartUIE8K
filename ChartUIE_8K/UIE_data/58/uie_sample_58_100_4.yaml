initial_prompt: Create a lollipop chart visualizing Amazon's 500 Bestsellers in Laptop
  Gear 2024. Use the '../Extra_datas/data/58.csv' file. Focus on the 'title', 'brand',
  'price/value', 'stars', and 'reviewsCount' columns. The chart should display each
  item's brand on the y-axis, with lollipops representing the price/value on the x-axis.
  Additionally, include color-coded stars and numeral reviewsCount as annotations.
  Ensure all items are included, even those with missing values. This will help in
  understanding the distribution and popularity of different brands and products in
  the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have specific colors you prefer for representing the different
  star ratings?

  2. Would you like the brands on the y-axis to be sorted in a particular order, such
  as alphabetical or by average price/value?

  3. Do you have a preference for the shape or size of the lollipop shapes (e.g.,
  circles, squares)?

  4. How would you like missing data to be represented?

  5. Should the numerical reviewsCount be displayed in a specific format or font size?

  6. Is there a particular style or theme you prefer for the chart (e.g., modern,
  classic)?

  7. How would you like items with similar prices to be differentiated?

  8. Should there be a legend explaining the color-coded stars, or will annotations
  suffice?

  9. Do you want a specific scale or range for the x-axis (price/value)?

  10. Would you like grid lines or axis labels to be included or excluded in the chart?'
