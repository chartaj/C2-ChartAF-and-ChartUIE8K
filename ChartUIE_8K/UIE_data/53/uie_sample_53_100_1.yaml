initial_prompt: Create a violin plot visualizing the distribution of 'Volume' over
  'Date' for META Stock Historical Prices. Highlight data points on significant trading
  days, like unusually high or low volumes, using different colors and sizes. Add
  text annotations for these highlighted points to draw attention to their specific
  values. Ensure the plot's design emphasizes trends and variations in trading volume
  over time while providing context on particularly active trading days. This visualization
  will help in analyzing trading behaviors and market responses over the provided
  timeframe. Make sure to format the dates on the x-axis for better readability.

  3. How would you prefer the highlighted points to be distinguished in terms of size
  and shape?

  4. Is there a specific date range that you want to focus on in the x-axis?

  5. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the text annotations on the plot?

  6. Are there any specific trends or patterns you would like to emphasize?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences for highlighting significant
  trading days.

  2. I do not have any specific preference for the details in the text annotations
  besides the volume values.

  3. I would prefer the highlighted points to be larger and maybe use a different
  shape like a circle.

  4. I am not sure about a specific date range; any range that shows clear trends
  is fine.

  5. I do not have any specific preference for the font style or size for the text
  annotations.

  6. I do not know if there are specific trends or patterns, just general trends and
  variations in trading volumes.'
