- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Line chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Line chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a line chart visualizing the historical prices of META stock from the data
  provided. The x-axis should represent the 'Date' while the y-axis should plot 'Open',
  'High', 'Low', and 'Close' prices across the time period. Highlight any significant
  peaks and dips in the stock prices. Ensure that the chart is easy to read with different
  lines for each type of price (Open, High, Low, Close) and include a legend for clarity.
  This should help me understand the stock's performance over time. Please use the
  detailed data to create the chart.
