initial_prompt: I have an Internshala Jobs Dataset focused on data-science-and-analytics
  internships. I want to create a word cloud that visualizes the most frequent job
  titles from the "JobTitles" column. This would emphasize common roles and key terms
  for prospective interns. Highlight larger and bolder words to indicate higher frequency.
  Shapes like rectangles or circles could be used to group similar job titles together
  based on shared keywords. This visualization will help job seekers identify popular
  job titles in the data-science-and-analytics domain and guide their applications
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the word cloud?

  2. Do you want to use any particular fonts for the text in the word cloud?

  3. Would you like to define the maximum number of words to display in the word cloud?

  4. Do you have preferences for the background color of the word cloud?

  5. Do you prefer a specific layout for the word cloud, such as horizontal, vertical,
  or a mix of both?

  6. Are there any particular shapes you prefer for grouping similar job titles, apart
  from rectangles or circles?

  7. Do you want any specific keywords or job titles to be highlighted differently
  from others?

  8. Is there a particular size range you want for the text to denote frequency?

  9. Would you like to add a heading or title to the word cloud? If so, what should
  it be?

  10. Do you want to include any legends or annotations within the word cloud?'
