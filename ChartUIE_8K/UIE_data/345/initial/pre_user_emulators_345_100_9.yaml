- Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique job titles mentioned
  in the Internshala Jobs Dataset related to "data-science-and-analytics." The chart
  should display the proportion of different job titles such as "WordPress Development
  Intern" and "ERPNext And HRMS Admin Intern," among others. Each slice of the pie
  should represent a job title, and the size should correspond to the number of unique
  occurrences of that job title. This will help understand the variety and frequency
  of job titles in the dataset.
