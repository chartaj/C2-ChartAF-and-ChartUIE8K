initial_prompt: Create a Sunburst chart to visualize the Internshala Jobs Dataset.
  The dataset includes categories like Company_Name, JobTitles, Skills, Description,
  Stipend, and Links. For the Sunburst chart, the primary layer should be JobTitles,
  followed by Company_Name as the secondary layer. The inner layers should represent
  Skills and Stipend. This will help to understand the distribution of job titles
  across different companies and the skills paired with their stipends. Include interactive
  elements to highlight specific segments when clicked. Ensure the chart is color-coded
  by job title for easy differentiation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used for
  differentiating job titles?

  2. What level of detail or granularity would you like for the Skills and Stipend
  layers?

  3. Should the Stipend values be displayed as exact values or within ranges?

  4. Would you prefer any specific labels or legends to be included or emphasized
  in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific companies or job titles that you would like to focus on
  or highlight in the visualization?'
