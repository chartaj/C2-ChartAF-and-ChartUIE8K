initial_prompt: Create a step line chart showing the distribution of stipends offered
  for different job titles in the Internshala Jobs Dataset. Use the 'Stipend' and
  'JobTitles' columns from the data. The x-axis should represent the unique job titles
  and the y-axis should represent the stipend values. Display the stipends for each
  job title as steps, helping identify the range of stipends offered across various
  positions. Make sure the chart clearly shows variations and trends in stipend offerings,
  which can be useful for job seekers and employers to understand the job market better.
