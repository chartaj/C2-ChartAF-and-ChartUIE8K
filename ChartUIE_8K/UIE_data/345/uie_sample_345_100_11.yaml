initial_prompt: Create a donut chart to visualize the distribution of unique job titles
  available in the Internshala Jobs Dataset. Use the 'JobTitles' column data to identify
  the count of each unique title. Color-code different sections of the donut to differentiate
  between distinct job titles. The chart should help in understanding which roles
  are most common in the dataset and highlight the variety of opportunities. Include
  a legend to clearly label each job title segment. Ensure the chart is visually appealing
  and easy to interpret for quick insights into job title diversity in the dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have specific color preferences for the different sections of
  the donut chart?

  2. What background color do you prefer for the chart?

  3. Is there a particular font style or size you would like for the legend and labels?

  4. Would you like the chart to have a title? If so, what should it be?

  5. Should the legend be placed in a specific position on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  6. Do you prefer a particular arrangement for the job title segments (e.g., alphabetical,
  by count)?

  7. Is there a maximum number of job titles you want to display in the donut chart,
  or should all unique titles be included?

  8. Do you have any preference for the thickness of the donut ring?

  9. Would you like to include percentage labels inside or outside the donut chart
  sections?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific color preferences, just ensure they are
  distinct and visually appealing.

  the focus on the chart.

  3. I do not know about font style or size, just make sure it is easy to read.

  4. Yes, please add a title: "Distribution of Job Titles in Internshala Jobs Dataset".

  5. No specific preference for the position of the legend, place it wherever it looks
  best.

  6. By count would be preferable.

  7. I do not know if there should be a maximum number; please use your judgment.

  8. I am not sure about the thickness of the donut ring.
