initial_prompt: I have a dataset that contains information about various internship
  opportunities, including details such as company name, job titles, required skills,
  descriptions, stipend, and application links. I would like to create a histogram
  showing the distribution of stipends across different internship positions. The
  y-axis should represent the number of internship positions, and the x-axis should
  represent stipend ranges. This will help in visualizing the most common stipend
  amounts offered for these internships. Please make sure that the stipend values
  are in a single currency format to ensure an accurate representation in the histogram.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred stipend range (e.g., minimum and maximum values)
  you would like to see on the x-axis?

  2. Are there specific stipend intervals (e.g., every 1,000 units) you prefer for
  the x-axis bins?

  3. Would you like to include a title for the histogram? If so, what should it be?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the colors used in the histogram bars?

  5. Should the histogram have grid lines? If so, do you have a preference for their
  appearance?

  6. Do you want to add labels or annotations to highlight certain stipend ranges
  within the histogram?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or any specific labels for the x-axis and
  y-axis?

  8. Are there specific formatting preferences for the stipend values (e.g., currency
  symbols, decimal places)?

  9. Do you have any preferred font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  10. Would you like to highlight the median or mean stipend value on the histogram,
  and if so, how would you like this to be represented?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I would like the title to be "Distribution of Internship Stipends".

  4. I do not have any specific preference for colors.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Stipend Amount" and the y-axis as "Number of
  Internship Positions".

  8. Yes, please include the currency symbol for the stipend values.

  9. I do not have any specific preference for font style or size.

  10. I am not sure.


  Thank you!'
