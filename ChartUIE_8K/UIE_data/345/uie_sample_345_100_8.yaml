initial_prompt: Create a box chart illustrating the distribution of stipends for internship
  positions listed in the Internshala Jobs Dataset. Use the 'Stipend' column as the
  primary data source to visualize the range, median, and quartiles of the monthly
  stipends offered across different internship positions. The chart should provide
  insights into the central tendency and variability of stipend amounts. Ensure to
  label the axes clearly, with 'Internship Positions' on the x-axis and 'Stipend Amount
  (₹)' on the y-axis. This will help us understand the financial aspect of these internships.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box chart?

  2. Should the chart include any specific annotations or data labels for the median
  and quartiles?

  3. Would you like to include any additional information or contextual data, such
  as the number of internships per stipend range?

  4. Do you prefer the box chart to display outliers explicitly?

  5. Should there be grid lines on the chart, and if so, would you prefer major or
  minor grid lines?

  6. Is there a specific order you would like the internship positions to be displayed
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, by stipend amount)?

  7. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the chart?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the font style and size of the axis labels and
  titles?

  9. Should the stipends be displayed in a specific format on the y-axis (e.g., with
  a currency symbol, in thousands)?

  10. Would you like to include a legend, or should the chart be self-explanatory?'
