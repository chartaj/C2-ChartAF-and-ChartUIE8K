initial_prompt: Create a column chart to show the distribution of different job titles
  (JobTitles) and the corresponding number of internships available for each title.
  Use the "Company_Name" and "JobTitles" columns to group internships by their job
  titles. The x-axis should represent distinct job titles, and the y-axis should display
  the number of internships available for each job title. Additionally, differentiate
  companies within each job title by using different colors or shades for each company
  in the column chart. This will help visualize how many companies offer internships
  for each job title in the Internshala Jobs Dataset.
