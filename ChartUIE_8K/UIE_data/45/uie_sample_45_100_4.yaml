initial_prompt: Please create a column chart visualizing the number of unique values
  for each column in the Electronic Waste Recycling Facilities List. The chart should
  have column names on the x-axis and the number of unique values on the y-axis. Make
  sure each column is represented to see the variety of data present. Highlight any
  columns with significantly fewer unique values. This visualization will help quickly
  identify how diverse the entries are within each category and understand the dataset
  more effectively. Thanks!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the columns in the chart?

  2. Would you like any specific color schemes for highlighting columns with significantly
  fewer unique values?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for the axis labels?

  4. Should the chart include data labels showing the exact number of unique values
  on each bar?

  5. Is there a specific order you want the columns to be displayed in (e.g., alphabetical,
  number of unique values)?

  6. Do you need a legend for this chart or is it not necessary given the clear labeling?

  7. Would you like gridlines on the chart to make it easier to read the values?

  8. Do you have a preference for the chart''s overall dimensions or aspect ratio?

  9. Should there be a specific title for the chart? If so, what should it be?

  10. Are there any annotations or notes you would like to add to highlight important
  insights directly on the chart?'
