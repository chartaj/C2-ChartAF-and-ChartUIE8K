initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap displaying the distribution of electronic
  waste recycling facilities across different counties in New York. Utilize the 'County'
  data for the x-axis and the 'Facility Name' count for the y-axis. This will help
  visualize facilities' concentration in each county. Also, indicate missing data
  points, if any, especially in 'Contact Email' for clear insight into data quality.
  The heatmap should be color-coded for easy visual interpretation. The aim is to
  analyze the density and geographical spread of recycling centers. Make sure the
  chart is labeled clearly and accurately.
