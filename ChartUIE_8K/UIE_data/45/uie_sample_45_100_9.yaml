initial_prompt: Visualize the facilities by county and registration number. Create
  a grouped bar chart showing the number of facilities per county and their corresponding
  registration numbers. This will help in understanding the distribution and density
  of electronic waste recycling facilities across different counties in NY. Group
  the bars by county and use different colors for registration numbers. Ensure all
  labels are clear and legible. Include a title, and axis labels for clarity. Using
  the sample data given, make sure to highlight counties with missing contact email
  details distinctly. This aids in identifying gaps in communication channels.
