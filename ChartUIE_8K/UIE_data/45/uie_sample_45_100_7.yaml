initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart visualizing the number of Electronic Waste
  Recycling Facilities per county in NY State, differentiated by the number of facilities
  having contact email and not having contact email. Use the "County" and "Contact
  Email" columns to create the stacks, and the facility counts for each as the bar
  heights. This will help us understand the distribution of e-waste facilities and
  identify counties with the most comprehensive contact information. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the stacks representing
  facilities with and without contact emails?

  2. Would you like the counties to be sorted in any particular order, such as alphabetically
  or by the number of facilities?

  3. Do you prefer any particular font style or size for labels and titles in the
  chart?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between facilities with and
  without contact emails?

  5. Would you like to add any specific titles or subtitles to the chart?

  6. Do you prefer any specific width or height for the bars in the chart?

  7. Are there any specific counties you would like to be highlighted or emphasized
  in the chart?

  8. Should the chart include gridlines, and if so, do you have any preference on
  their style or color?

  9. Do you want to display the actual counts of facilities on each bar segment?'
answers: '1. I am not sure about specific colors.

  2. I do not know, any logical order is fine.

  3. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  and the subtitle "Differentiated by Availability of Contact Email".

  6. I do not have any specific preference for the width or height.

  7. I do not know, no specific counties need to be highlighted.

  8. I am not sure about gridlines, use what looks best.
