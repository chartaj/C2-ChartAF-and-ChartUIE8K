initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Electronic Waste Recycling Facilities list. Please
  create a bar chart that shows the number of facilities in each county. The x-axis
  should represent the counties, and the y-axis should represent the count of facilities.
  This will help visualize which counties have the most and least facilities. Please
  ensure the chart is clear and the labels are legible. Make the bars colorful, and
  also include data labels on top of each bar to show the exact count of facilities.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars in the chart?

  2. What font style and size would you prefer for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  3. Would you like any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  4. Is there a particular order in which you would like the counties to be arranged
  on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetical, descending order of facility counts)?

  5. Do you prefer grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?

  6. Should the chart include a legend, or is it unnecessary given the simplicity
  of the data?

  7. How would you like the data labels on top of each bar to be formatted (e.g.,
  font size, color, bold)?'
