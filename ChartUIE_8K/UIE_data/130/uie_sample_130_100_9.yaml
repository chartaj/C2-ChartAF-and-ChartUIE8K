initial_prompt: I need a line chart visualizing the prep_time and cook_time for various
  Indian desserts. Use data from "Indian Food 101" and include icons or colors to
  differentiate between vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. Ensure the x-axis has
  the name of the dishes while the y-axis shows the time in minutes. Highlight regions
  with different colors or markers to add more context to each dish's origin. This
  will help me compare cooking times and understand regional variations better. Consider
  any missing values while plotting to avoid misrepresentation.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for distinguishing between
  vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes?

  2. What icons would you prefer to use to differentiate between vegetarian and non-vegetarian
  dishes?

  3. Are there any specific regions or states you want to be highlighted in the chart?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the style or shape of markers to be used for
  highlighting different regions?

  5. Would you like to see grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  6. Do you have any preference for the font style or size for the dish names on the
  x-axis?

  7. Should the chart include a legend to indicate the colors or icons used for vegetarian
  and non-vegetarian dishes as well as the regions?'
