initial_prompt: I need a bar chart showing the distribution of Indian desserts by
  state. Use data from Indian Food 101. The x-axis should list the states, and the
  y-axis should show the count of desserts. Each bar should represent the number of
  desserts originating from each state. Include labels for the states and a title
  "Distribution of Indian Desserts by State." Make sure the chart is colorful and
  easy to read for a food and drink presentation. This will help visualize the culinary
  diversity across different regions of India.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bar chart?

  2. What font style and size would you like for the chart labels?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart? If so, should they be displayed for both
  x-axis and y-axis or just one of them?

  4. Where would you like the chart legend to be placed, if at all?

  5. Would you prefer the bars to be a standard width or adjusted based on the data?

  6. Should there be any specific sorting order for the states on the x-axis?

  7. Is there a specific format in which you''d like the title "Distribution of Indian
  Desserts by State" to be displayed?

  8. Do you have any preferences for labeling the y-axis (e.g., font size, angle,
  color)?

  9. Would you like any additional information or notes to be included on the chart?'
