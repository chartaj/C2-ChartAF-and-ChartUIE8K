initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot visualizing Indian desserts data. Plot 'prep_time'
  on the x-axis and 'cook_time' on the y-axis for different dishes. Use data-driven
  text annotations to display the 'name' of the dish at each data point. Highlight
  the points using color to indicate 'region'â€”different colors for East, West, North.
  This visualization will help compare preparation and cooking times across various
  regions and dishes, focusing particularly on those with shorter or longer times.
  Provide a legend explaining which color corresponds to which region and ensure all
  names are clearly visible for easy identification.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the regions (East, West,
  North)?

  2. What size would you like the data points to be on the scatter plot?

  3. Do you have a specific font style or size preference for the text annotations
  displaying the dish names?

  4. Should the chart have grid lines, and if so, should they be solid or dashed?

  5. Do you prefer the axes labels (for ''prep_time'' and ''cook_time'') to be in
  a specific format or style?

  6. Would you like the axes to have custom scales (e.g., logarithmic, linear) or
  ranges?

  7. Should the chart title and legend have any specific formatting or positioning?

  8. Do you have a specific layout preference for the legend (e.g., horizontal or
  vertical orientation, placement)?

  9. Should the plot background and the axes background be in a specific color?

  10. Are there any specific data points (names of dishes) you want to emphasize or
  highlight differently?'
