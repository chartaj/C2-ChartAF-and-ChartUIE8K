initial_prompt: I'm working on a project about Indian cuisine and I have some data
  detailing various dishes. I want a Radar chart to visualize certain aspects of each
  dish like 'prep_time', 'cook_time', 'flavor_profile', 'course', 'state', and 'region'.
  I'm particularly interested in comparing these attributes for a number of dishes
  simultaneously to understand their similarities and differences better. Please create
  a Radar chart using the given data format to highlight these attributes clearly.
  Thank you!
questions: '1. How many dishes do you want to include in the Radar chart?

  2. Do you prefer specific colors for different dishes or attributes?

  3. Should the chart include labeled data points for each attribute?

  4. Would you like a legend to identify different dishes or attributes?

  5. Are there any specific labels or titles you want on the axes?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scale or range used on the Radar chart?

  7. Should the chart display any grid lines to make comparisons easier?

  8. How would you like the data for categorical attributes (like ''flavor_profile'',
  ''course'', ''state'', ''region'') to be represented?'
