  I would like a donut chart visualizing the distribution of dishes by state from
  the Indian Food 101 dataset. This chart will help highlight regional culinary diversity.
  Make sure to annotate the chart with values and include highlights for the states
  with the most and least number of dishes. The purpose here is to showcase the variety
  of Indian food by region, making it clear which states contribute most and least
  to the cuisine. Use different colors to distinguish the states effectively.
