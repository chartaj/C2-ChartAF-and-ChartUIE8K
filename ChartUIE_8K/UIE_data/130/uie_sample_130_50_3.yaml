initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of prep time and
  cook time for various Indian desserts. Make sure to use the data from Indian Food
  101 to reflect different regions, diet types, and flavor profiles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred histogram bin width or range for the prep time
  and cook time distribution?

  2. Would you like to display separate histograms for different regions, diet types,
  or flavor profiles, or should they be combined in some way?

  3. Should the histograms be color-coded based on region, diet type, or flavor profile?

  4. Do you have a preference for the number of bins in the histogram?

  5. Would you like to include any specific annotations or labels on the histograms?

  6. Do you prefer a specific layout (e.g., side-by-side or stacked histograms) to
  compare the distributions?

  7. Is there any specific color palette you would like to use for the histograms?

  8. Should the histograms include a density curve overlay to show the distribution
  more clearly?

  9. Do you want to include gridlines in the histograms for better readability?

  10. Would you like to add a legend to the histograms to explain the color coding
  or categories used?'
