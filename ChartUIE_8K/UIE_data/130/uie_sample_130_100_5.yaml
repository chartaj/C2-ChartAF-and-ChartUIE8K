initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of Indian food based
  on prep_time and cook_time across different states and regions. Plot prep_time on
  the x-axis and cook_time on the y-axis. Each cell should represent the frequency
  of recipes with specific prep_time and cook_time combinations, differentiated by
  states and regions. Use different color gradients to indicate varying frequencies.
  This will help in understanding which regions have foods with longer or shorter
  cooking and preparation times. This is useful for food enthusiasts and researchers
  interested in regional cooking patterns in Indian cuisine.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color gradients in mind for indicating frequencies?

  2. What range of values for ''prep_time'' and ''cook_time'' would you like to focus
  on?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling or annotation on the x-axis (prep_time) and
  y-axis (cook_time)?

  4. Are there any specific states or regions you would like to highlight in the heatmap?

  5. How detailed do you want the frequency differentiation to be?

  6. Would you like any additional information (such as tooltips) to appear when hovering
  over specific cells?

  7. Do you have any layout preferences for the chart (e.g., aspect ratio, size)?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. I do not have a specific color gradient in mind.

  2. I am not sure about the range of values for ''prep_time'' and ''cook_time''.

  3. I do not have any specific preference for labeling the x-axis and y-axis.

  4. I do not know if there are specific states or regions I want to highlight.

  5. I would like the frequency differentiation to be detailed enough to notice patterns.

  6. I am not sure about additional information like tooltips.

  7. I have no specific preference for the layout of the chart.
