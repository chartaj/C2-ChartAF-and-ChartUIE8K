initial_prompt: Please create a histogram to visualize the frequency of different
  'Technology Names' detected across various 'Website Domains' in the B2B Technographic
  Data from US Techsalerator. Each bar should represent a unique technology name,
  and the height should indicate the number of websites using that technology. Ensure
  the x-axis lists 'Technology Names' and the y-axis shows the count of websites.
  This will help us understand which technologies are most commonly used. Additionally,
  highlight any missing values accordingly in the data before creating the histogram.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference on the color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How would you like the missing values to be highlighted in the histogram?

  3. Would you prefer grid lines on the chart for better readability?

  4. Should the x-axis ''Technology Names'' be displayed at a specific angle or rotation
  for better clarity?

  5. Do you want the bars to have specific widths or should it be auto-adjusted based
  on the data?

  6. Are there any specific fonts or font sizes you prefer for the axis labels and
  title?

  7. Would you like to include a legend or any additional annotations on the chart?'
