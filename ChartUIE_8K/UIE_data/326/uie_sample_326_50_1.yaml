initial_prompt: Create a treemap to visualize the distribution of various technologies
  across different website domains. Highlight unique technologies and annotate first
  seen dates to emphasize historical trends in usage. Use colors to differentiate
  technology categories.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating technology
  categories?

  2. Should the size of each section in the treemap be based on the number of occurrences
  or another metric?

  3. How would you like the "First Seen At" dates to be annotated (e.g., tooltip,
  label, etc.)?

  4. Would you prefer to see additional labels on the treemap, such as the percentage
  distribution of each technology?

  5. Are there any specific technology categories that should be highlighted more
  prominently?

  6. Is there a specific font style or size you would like for the text annotations
  or labels?

  7. Do you have a preference for the layout orientation of the treemap (e.g., squarified,
  slice and dice, etc.)?

  8. Should the chart include a legend or key to explain the color coding and any
  other symbols?

  9. Are there any specific domain or technology types that should be grouped or displayed
  together?

  10. How detailed should the annotations for historical trends be (e.g., only the
  year, full timestamp, etc.)?'
