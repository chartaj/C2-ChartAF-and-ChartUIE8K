initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the B2B technographic data from the
  US Techsalerator. The heatmap should display the relationship between Website Domain
  and Technology Name, with the intensity representing how frequently each technology
  is used by each domain. Ensure to highlight the 'First Seen At' and 'Last Seen At'
  periods to observe technology adoption trends over time. Include annotations for
  missing 'Ticker' values to highlight gaps. This visualization will help us quickly
  understand the tech stack landscape of different companies and identify key technology
  trends and gaps in the recorded data.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color schemes for the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the heatmap to have a specific title or subtitle?

  3. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the intensity values?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for axis labels and annotations?

  5. Should the annotations for missing ''Ticker'' values be in a specific format
  or color?

  6. Do you prefer the time periods ''First Seen At'' and ''Last Seen At'' to be displayed
  in any particular date format?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be shown or hidden in the heatmap?

  8. How would you prefer to handle overlapping texts or labels in densely populated
  areas of the heatmap?

  9. Do you need additional tooltips to provide more information on hover?

  10. Should the heatmap be divided into specific time intervals or segments for better
  visibility of trends over time?'
