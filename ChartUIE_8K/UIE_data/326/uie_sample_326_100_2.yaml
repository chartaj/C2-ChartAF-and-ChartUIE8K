initial_prompt: Create a bar chart visualizing the number of unique "Technology Name"
  entries per "Website Domain". Highlight domains with the highest technology count.
  Annotate specific data points to reflect the first and last seen dates for a few
  highlighted technologies. The chart aims to show technological adoption trends across
  different business websites, emphasizing those with the broadest range of technology
  use. This visualization helps stakeholders understand which sites are leaders in
  technology application and monitor their technological landscape over time. The
  practicality of this chart lies in its ability to identify and showcase domain leaders
  in technology usage.
