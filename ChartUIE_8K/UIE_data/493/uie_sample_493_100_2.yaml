initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between
  x and y. Include text annotations to display specific data point values, highlighting
  any interesting trends or points that stand out. This will help in focusing attention
  on particular areas of the data. Both x and y are continuous variables with no missing
  values. Ensure the chart highlights the most unique and significant points to emphasize
  their importance in the context of data science and analytics. Use visual elements
  like size or color to distinguish these key points.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color scheme preferences for distinguishing
  key data points?

  2. How would you like to annotate the specific data points (e.g., with values, labels,
  or both)?

  3. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the size of the key points vary based on their significance, or would
  you prefer a uniform size?

  5. Are there any specific points that you already know are significant and should
  be highlighted?

  6. Would you like to include grid lines for better readability of the scatter plot?

  7. Do you have a preferred background color for the scatter plot?

  8. Should the axes have specific labels or units mentioned?

  9. Do you want to display a trend line to help indicate the correlation between
  x and y?

  10. Are there any specific data points or ranges that you would like to focus on
  more closely?'
answers: '1. I do not have any specific color scheme preferences.

  2. I would like to annotate the specific data points with both values and labels.

  3. I have no specific preference for font style or size.

  4. I am not sure; perhaps the size can vary based on significance.

  5. I do not know of any specific points to highlight.

  6. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful for better readability.

  7. I have no specific preference for the background color.

  8. Yes, the axes should have specific labels indicating what they represent.

  9. A trend line would be useful to help indicate the correlation between x and y.

  10. I do not know of any specific data points or ranges to focus on more closely.'
