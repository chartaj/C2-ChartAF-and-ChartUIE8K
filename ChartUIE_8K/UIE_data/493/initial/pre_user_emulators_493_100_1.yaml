2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart using data with columns 'x' and 'y'. Highlight the key data
  points on the curve, especially where 'y' values change rapidly. Include text annotations
  for these critical points to draw attention. Use different colors or sizes for highlights
  to distinguish important points from others. Make sure the visualization serves
  the purpose of understanding trends in 'y' relative to 'x' effectively. Text annotations
  should be data-driven and highlight values of specific points for clarity. Add non-data-driven
  annotations to provide context or comments as necessary.
