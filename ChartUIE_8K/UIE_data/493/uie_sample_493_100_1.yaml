initial_prompt: Create a line chart using data with columns 'x' and 'y'. Highlight
  the key data points on the curve, especially where 'y' values change rapidly. Include
  text annotations for these critical points to draw attention. Use different colors
  or sizes for highlights to distinguish important points from others. Make sure the
  visualization serves the purpose of understanding trends in 'y' relative to 'x'
  effectively. Text annotations should be data-driven and highlight values of specific
  points for clarity. Add non-data-driven annotations to provide context or comments
  as necessary.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the colors used to highlight
  the key data points?

  2. What style of line (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.) would you prefer for the main
  line in the chart?

  3. Are there particular symbols (e.g., circles, squares) that you prefer for highlighting
  key data points?

  4. Do you have any preferences regarding the font style and size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a grid for better readability, and if so,
  in which style?

  6. Do you have preferred locations for placing non-data-driven annotations for context
  or comments?

  7. How many critical points would you like to highlight on the chart?

  8. Do you prefer the chart to have a title and/or subtitles, and if yes, do you
  have a specific title/subtitle in mind?

  9. Would you like to include axis labels, and if so, do you have specific labels
  in mind?

  10. Are there any specific ranges or intervals on the ''x'' or ''y'' axes that you
  would like to emphasize or annotate?'
answers: '1. I do not have specific preferences for the colors used to highlight the
  key data points.

  2. I am not sure about the style of line; maybe a solid line would work.

  3. I have no specific preference for symbols to highlight key data points.

  4. I do not know about the font style and size for the text annotations.

  5. A grid for better readability would be good, but I am not sure which style.

  6. I do not have preferred locations for non-data-driven annotations.

  7. Maybe highlight around 3 to 5 critical points on the chart.

  8. A title and subtitle would be nice, but I do not have specific ones in mind.

  9. Axis labels would be helpful. Maybe "X-Axis" for the x-axis and "Y-Axis" for
  the y-axis.

  10. I do not have any specific ranges or intervals in mind to emphasize or annotate.'
