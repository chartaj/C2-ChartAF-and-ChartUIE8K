initial_prompt: Please create a Treemap chart for my "Settlers of Catan" games data.
  The chart should illustrate the distribution of points scored by players across
  different games. Use the "player," "points," and "gameNum" columns to create this
  visualization. Make sure to include all players and games in the dataset to provide
  a comprehensive overview. Additionally, include tooltips that display detailed information
  like the settlements and total gain/loss for each player when hovered over. This
  will help in understanding the player's performance and strategy across different
  games.
