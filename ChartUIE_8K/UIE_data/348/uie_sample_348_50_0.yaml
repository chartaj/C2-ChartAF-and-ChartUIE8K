initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart visualizing points per player across multiple
  games from "My Settlers of Catan Games." Highlight key players and annotate their

  \ grouped bar chart?\n2. Do you have any specific players you would like to highlight?\n\
  3. Should the bars representing tradeGain and tradeLoss have distinct colors or\
  \ patterns?\n4. Do you prefer to have the totalAvailable values annotated directly\
  \ on the bars or displayed in a tooltip?\n5. Is there a specific order you would\
  \ like to follow for grouping the bars (e.g., by player, by game number)?\n6. Would\
  \ you like to include any gridlines or background to improve readability?\n7. Should\
  \ the chart include a legend to clarify the different data attributes (e.g., points,\
  \ tradeGain, tradeLoss)?\n8. Do you have any preference for the font style or size\
  \ used in the annotations and labels?\n9. Are there any specific axis titles or\
  \ labels you would like to include? \n10. Would you like to see data points or lines\
  \ connecting the bars to convey trends or comparisons?\n11. Do you prefer a vertical\
  \ or horizontal orientation for the grouped bar chart?"
