initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize points and totalAvailable
  for each player in my Settlers of Catan games. Use different colors for points and
  totalAvailable bars per player to show the performance comparison clearly. Annotate
  the highest points and totalAvailable for better emphasis. Highlight any differences
  between the players to identify patterns in game outcomes. Use the sample data provided
