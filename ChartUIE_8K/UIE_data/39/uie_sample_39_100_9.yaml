initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap using the provided Glass Classification data
  from the CSV file. I want the heatmap to visualize the correlation between the different
  chemical components (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) and the glass type (Type).
  The heatmap should highlight any strong positive or negative correlations between
  these variables. Use a color gradient that clearly distinguishes between high and
  low correlation values. Also, please ensure that each axis is labeled with the corresponding
  chemical component and glass type. This will help in understanding the relationships
  between the variables in the dataset. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color gradient for the heatmap (e.g., red-blue,
  green-yellow, etc.)?

  2. Would you like the correlation values to be displayed on the heatmap cells?

  3. What level of granularity would you prefer for the color gradient (e.g., more
  distinct steps or a smooth gradient)?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the heatmap''s size and dimensions?

  5. Would you like to include any particular annotations or notes on the heatmap?

  6. Do you want a specific title or subtitle for the heatmap?

  7. Should the color scale legend be placed in a specific position (e.g., right,
  bottom)?

  8. Are there any preferred axis label sizes or font styles you would like?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would like the correlation values to be displayed on the heatmap cells.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I do not have any specific preferences for the heatmap''s size and dimensions.

  5. No, I do not want to include any particular annotations or notes.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not have a preference for the color scale legend position.

  8. I do not know.'
