initial_prompt: I need a line chart to visualize the glass classification data provided
  in the CSV file. The chart should show the variation of different chemical components
  (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) across the samples. Each line in the chart should
  represent a separate chemical component, with the x-axis representing the sample
  index (or count) and the y-axis representing the quantity of each component. Label
  the axes and include a legend to differentiate the components. Ensure the chart
  is clear and easy to understand.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the chart?

  2. Would you like gridlines to be included in the chart for better readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  4. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart (e.g., top, bottom,
  right, left)?

  5. Should the lines representing each chemical component be solid or do you prefer
  different line styles (e.g., dashed, dotted) for differentiation?

  6. Do you have a specific title in mind for the chart?

  7. Would you like to include data point markers on the lines to highlight each sample''s
  value?

  8. Is there a specific range you would like to set for the y-axis, or should it
  be determined automatically based on the data?'
answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, I would like gridlines to be included for better readability.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I prefer the legend to be positioned at the bottom.

  5. I prefer solid lines for each chemical component.

  6. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  7. Yes, I would like to include data point markers on the lines.

  8. It should be determined automatically based on the data.'
