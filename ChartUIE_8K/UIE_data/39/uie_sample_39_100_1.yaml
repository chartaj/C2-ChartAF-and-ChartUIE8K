initial_prompt: Let's create a box chart using the glass classification dataset. Each
  box should represent the distribution of values for the different chemical attributes
  (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) across each glass type (Type). Highlight any
  outliers and significant differences between types. Annotations should emphasize
  key summary statistics like median, quartiles, and any unique insights. This will
  help understand the variations in glass composition and classification. The chart
  needs to focus on the comparison and distribution of chemical components to help
  identify patterns and differences among the glass types.
questions: '1. Do you have any color preferences for the box plots or outliers?

  2. Would you like the boxes to be filled with a specific pattern or remain solid?

  3. Should the outliers be displayed in a specific shape or size?

  4. Do you prefer particular axis labels'' font style or size?

  5. Would you like grid lines to be shown on the chart? If so, in a particular style
  or color?

  6. Should the key summary statistics (median, quartiles) be annotated inside the
  box or on the outer edge?

  7. Do you have a preference for the arrangement of the chemical attributes on the
  axis?

  8. Would you like any specific title or subtitle for the chart?

  9. Do you prefer a specific style or format for the annotations highlighting significant
  differences and unique insights?

  10. Do you need a specific legend configuration to explain the different elements
  (outliers, quartiles, etc.) on the chart?'
answers: '1. I have no specific preference for the color of the box plots or outliers.

  2. I am not sure if the boxes should have a specific pattern or remain solid.

  3. I do not know about the shape or size for the outliers.

  4. I have no specific preference for the axis labels'' font style or size.

  5. I am not sure about the grid lines, maybe keep them simple.

  6. Please annotate the key summary statistics (median, quartiles) inside the boxes.

  7. I do not have a preference for the arrangement of the chemical attributes on
  the axis.

  8. I have no specific title or subtitle in mind for the chart.

  9. I am not sure about the style or format for the annotations highlighting significant
  differences and unique insights.

  10. I do not have a specific preference for the legend configuration.'
