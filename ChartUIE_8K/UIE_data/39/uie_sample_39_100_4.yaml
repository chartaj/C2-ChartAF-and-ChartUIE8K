initial_prompt: I have a dataset related to Glass Classification with various chemical
  properties measured like RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe, and the Type of glass.
  I'd like a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between two of these variables,
  say 'RI' and 'Na', and distinguish different glass types using color coding or different
  markers. It will help me understand how these properties are distributed and correlated
  among different types of glass. The plot should clearly label the axes, include
  a legend for the glass types, and display a title for better understanding.
questions: '1. What title would you like for the scatter plot?

  2. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette to distinguish different
  glass types?

  3. Would you like the glass types to be represented by different markers or just
  colors?

  4. Are there any specific axis ranges you want to set for the RI and Na values?

  5. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and legend?

  6. Would you like grid lines to be included in the background of the scatter plot
  for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer the plot to have a light or dark background?'
answers: '<start of user emulated response>

  1. Glass Classification based on RI and Na

  2. I am not sure

  3. Different markers would be good

  4. I do not know

  5. I have no specific preference

  6. Yes, grid lines would be helpful

  7. Light background
