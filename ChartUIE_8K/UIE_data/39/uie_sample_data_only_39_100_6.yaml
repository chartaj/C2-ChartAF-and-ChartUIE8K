02_initial_prompt: Please create a stacked bar chart to visualize the glass classification
  data. The x-axis should represent the different types of glass (Type 1 to Type 6),
  and the y-axis should represent the concentration of various elements (RI, Na, Mg,
  Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe). Each bar stack should be divided into segments showing the
  concentration of each element within the same type of glass. Use different colors
  to differentiate between the elements. This will help us understand the composition
  variations across different glass types. Make sure to include a legend for clarity.
