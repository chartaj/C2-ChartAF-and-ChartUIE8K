initial_prompt: I need a grouped bar chart that visualizes the relationship between
  different types of glasses (Type column) and their corresponding chemical compositions
  (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe columns). Please use the data provided to create
  a chart that compares the average values of these chemical components for each glass
  type. Make sure each type is represented with a distinct color and that the bars
  for each chemical are grouped together for quick comparison. This will help to easily
  see how the chemical compositions differ between the different glass types.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred title for the chart?

  2. Would you like to include axis labels? If so, please specify the labels for both
  axes.

  3. Do you prefer showing the exact values on top of each bar?

  4. Do you have a preference for the layout of the bar groups (vertically or horizontally)?

  5. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?

  6. Is there a specific color palette you would like to use for the glass types?

  7. Should there be a legend for the chart, and if so, do you have a preference for
  its placement?

  8. How do you want to handle bars with very low or zero values in terms of visibility
  and display?

  9. Would you like to see any specific statistical markers (e.g., error bars) to
  represent variability?'

  1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the x-axis should be labeled "Chemical Components" and the y-axis "Average
  Values".

  3. I am not sure.

  4. I prefer the bars to be grouped vertically.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines.

  6. I do not have a specific color palette in mind.

  7. Yes, a legend would be helpful. I am not sure about the placement, maybe wherever
  it fits best.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.
