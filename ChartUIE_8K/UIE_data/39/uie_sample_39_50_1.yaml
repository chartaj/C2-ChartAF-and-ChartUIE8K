initial_prompt: Create a histogram to visualize the distribution of all chemical elements
  (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) with annotations. Highlight unique types and
  display counts.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for different chemical elements?

  2. Would you like a particular bin size or number of bins for the histogram?

  3. How should the annotations be displayed (e.g., inside the bars, above the bars,
  or as tooltips)?

  4. Is there a preferred way to highlight unique elements (e.g., different colors,
  patterns, or markers)?

  5. Do you want to include gridlines or reference lines in the histogram?

  6. Should the x-axis and y-axis have specific labels or scales (e.g., logarithmic
  scale)?

  7. Are there any specific fonts or styles you prefer for the text and annotations?

  8. Would you like to display the counts as absolute numbers, percentages, or both?

  9. Is there a preferred layout or orientation for the histogram (e.g., vertical
  or horizontal bars)?

  10. Do you need a legend to explain colors, patterns, or other markers in the histogram?'
