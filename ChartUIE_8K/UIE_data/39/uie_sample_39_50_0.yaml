initial_prompt: Visualize glass classification data using parallel coordinates. Annotate
  unique patterns in chemical composition, especially Al, Ca, Type, and highlight
  Type categories.
questions: '1. Do you have any preferred color scheme for highlighting the different
  Type categories?

  2. Would you like the axes for each attribute to be scaled independently or uniformly?

  3. Should the annotations for unique patterns be positioned in a particular way
  (e.g., inside the plot, on the axes, or as tooltips)?

  4. Do you prefer specific line styles or thickness for distinguishing between different
  Type categories?

  5. Are there any additional attributes you would like to include besides Al, Ca,
  and Type?

  6. Should the chart display any statistical information or summary metrics (e.g.,
  mean, median) for the attributes?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the layout or orientation of the parallel coordinates
  plot (e.g., horizontal or vertical)?

  8. Would you like to include a legend to explain the Type categories and their corresponding
  colors or patterns?

  9. Are there any specific fonts or text sizes you prefer for labels and annotations?

  10. Do you have any preferences regarding the background color or grid lines of
  the chart?'
