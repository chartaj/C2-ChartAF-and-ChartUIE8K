02_initial_prompt: Let's create a box chart using the glass classification dataset.
  Each box should represent the distribution of values for the different chemical
  attributes (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe) across each glass type (Type). Highlight
  any outliers and significant differences between types. Annotations should emphasize
  key summary statistics like median, quartiles, and any unique insights. This will
  help understand the variations in glass composition and classification. The chart
  needs to focus on the comparison and distribution of chemical components to help
  identify patterns and differences among the glass types.
