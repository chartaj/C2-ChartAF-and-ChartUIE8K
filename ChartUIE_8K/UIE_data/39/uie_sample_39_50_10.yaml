initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap displaying the correlation between chemical
  components in the glass dataset. Ensure that all columns (RI, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K,
  Ca, Ba, Fe) and the target (Type) are included.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like to display the correlation values (e.g., within the cells
  using a specific font size)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the axis labels and titles?

  4. Should we include a color legend to interpret the correlation scale?

  5. Do you have any particular layout preferences for the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to highlight any specific correlations or ranges within the heatmap?

  7. Should the heatmap include gridlines for better readability?

  8. Do you have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the heatmap?

  9. Would you like to display annotations or text indicating correlation strength
  within the cells?

  10. Do you have any preferences for clustering or ordering of rows and columns based
  on correlation strength?'
