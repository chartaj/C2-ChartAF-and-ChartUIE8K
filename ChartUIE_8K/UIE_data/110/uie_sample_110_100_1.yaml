initial_prompt: Create a stacked bar chart to visualize alcohol consumption worldwide.
  Use countries as categories and stack beer, spirit, and wine servings along with
  total litres of pure alcohol. Highlight countries with the highest total consumption.
  Add annotations to show exact values for top five countries and note that Afghanistan
  has zero consumption as context. The purpose is to compare alcohol consumption patterns
  across different nations, emphasizing those with extreme values for better understanding
  of global drinking habits. Make sure the legend distinguishes between beer, spirit,
  and wine servings effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color palette used in
  the chart, especially for distinguishing between beer, spirit, and wine servings?

  2. What type of font would you prefer for the annotations and labels on the chart?

  3. Do you have a preferred format or style for the annotations showing the exact
  values for the top five countries?

  4. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability, and if so, do you
  have a specific preference for their style (e.g., dashed, dotted)?

  5. Do you want specific formatting for the legend to ensure clarity between different
  servings types?

  6. Are there any specific countries, in addition to Afghanistan, you would like
  to highlight or annotate within the chart?

  7. Do you have a preference for the chart''s orientation (vertical or horizontal
  stacked bar chart)?

  8. Would you like to include labels for total litres of pure alcohol directly on
  the bars, or should they be incorporated in a tooltip or separate annotation?

  9. Should the chart include a title and subtitle, and if so, what would you like
  them to be?'
