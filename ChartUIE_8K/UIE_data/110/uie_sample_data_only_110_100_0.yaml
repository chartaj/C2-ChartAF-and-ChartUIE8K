  1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe a gradient from blue (low) to red (high) could be effective?

  3. Text labels would be best for the annotations.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. No, just focus on the countries and alcohol consumption.

  7. I have no specific preference.

  8. Yes, please include a legend to help interpret the color gradients.

  9. I do not know.

  10. No additional data insights are needed.
