initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot showing the relationship between fuel cost per
  year and highway MPG for different car models. Use data from "fuelCost08" and "highway08"
  columns. Highlight data points to indicate vehicle makes.
questions: "1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used to differentiate\
  \ vehicle makes?\n2. Would you like the size or shape of the data points to vary\
  \ based on vehicle characteristics such as cylinder count or engine displacement?\n\
  3. Should there be a regression line included on the scatter plot to show the overall\
  \ trend?\n4. Do you prefer specific axis labels or any particular formatting for\
  \ the axis units (e.g., dollars for fuel cost, miles per gallon for MPG)?\n5. Would\
  \ you like to add a legend to the chart to indicate the vehicle makes represented\
  \ by different colors?\n6. Are there any specific annotations or markers you would\
  \ like to include on the scatter plot?\n7. Do you have a preferred title or subtitle\
  \ for the chart?\n8. Would you like any gridlines in the background to improve readability?\
  \ \n9. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the text elements on\
  \ the chart?\n10. Do you want to include any data source or notes at the bottom\
  \ of the chart?"

  gallon)" would be great.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to indicate the vehicle makes represented by different
  colors.
