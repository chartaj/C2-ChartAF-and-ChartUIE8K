initial_prompt: Create a line chart tracking the progress of fuel costs, CO2 emissions,
  and MPG performance over the years for various vehicles. Use annotations to highlight
  key points, such as the highest fuel costs and significant drops in CO2 emissions.
  Highlight cars with the highest city and highway mileage. The chart aims to illustrate
  the financial and environmental benefits of transitioning to more fuel-efficient
  or electric vehicles, showcasing the potential money savings and reductions in emissions.
  Ensure that the data visualization is clear and engaging to emphasize the comparisons
  effectively.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Would you like to see grid lines to enhance readability?

  3. Do you prefer a specific line style, such as dashed or solid lines, for different
  data attributes?

  4. How would you like the annotations to be displayed (e.g., text boxes, labels,
  arrows)?

  5. Is there a specific font style or size you prefer for the annotations and labels?

  6. Do you want to include a legend to differentiate between the different data attributes?

  7. Do you have a preference for the placement of the legend (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  8. Should the y-axis represent a single combined scale or separate scales for different
  attributes (e.g., fuel cost, CO2 emissions, MPG)?

  9. Are there any specific vehicles or years you want to emphasize in the chart?

  10. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, do you
  have any specific text in mind?

  11. Do you have any preferences for the format of the x-axis and y-axis labels (e.g.,
  date format, units)?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, grid lines would be helpful to enhance readability.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. I would prefer text boxes for the annotations.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Yes, a legend would be useful to differentiate between the data attributes.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Separate scales for different attributes would be better.

  9. I am not sure about specific vehicles or years.

  10. Yes, I would like to include a title and subtitle. Title: "Tracking Fuel Costs,
  CO2 Emissions, and MPG Performance Over the Years". Subtitle: "Illustrating the
  Financial and Environmental Benefits of More Fuel-Efficient and Electric Vehicles".

  11. I do not have a specific preference for the format of the labels.'
