initial_prompt: Please create a table chart to compare the fuel savings and costs
  associated with different car models from 1985. Include columns for "Make," "Model,"
  "Year," "Fuel Cost (annually)," "City MPG," "Highway MPG," "Combined MPG," "CO2
  Emissions," "Fuel Type," and "Money Saved/Spent." Highlight the rows where electric
  cars show significant cost savings compared to regular gasoline cars. This will
  help visualize the potential fuel savings and environmental benefits of switching
  to electric cars. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. Should the table include any specific formatting for easier readability (e.g.,
  alternating row colors)?

  3. Would you like to sort the table by a specific column (e.g., highest fuel savings
  or lowest CO2 emissions) by default?

  4. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text in the chart?

  5. Are there any specific labels, tooltips, or annotations you would like added
  to the chart for clarity?

  6. Do you want any specific symbols or icons to differentiate electric cars from
  gasoline cars in the table?

  7. Is there any specific way you would like the "Money Saved/Spent" column to be
  highlighted?

  8. What is the maximum number of car models you would like to display in the table?

  9. Would you like to include any footnotes or additional information at the bottom
  of the table?

  10. Do you have any specific instructions for how the electric cars'' rows should
  be highlighted (e.g., background color, border)?'
