initial_prompt: I want a geographic heatmap showing regions where people save the
  most money by using electric cars compared to gasoline cars. Use the data provided,
  particularly focusing on 'fuelCost08', 'comb08', and 'youSaveSpend'. Highlight areas
  with greater savings in a distinct color and gasoline areas in another. The heatmap
  should be easy to read and visually appealing. Include the 'city08', 'highway08',
  and 'make' to enhance the detail. Display data from different years to indicate
  trends over time. Please ensure the map is interactive so users can zoom into specific
  regions.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. How would you like the regions to be divided? (e.g., by state, county, zip code)

  3. Would you prefer the data to be aggregated annually, monthly, or a different
  time interval?

  4. Do you want tooltips to display specific information when hovering over a region?

  5. Would you like to include any legends or keys to explain the colors used in the
  heatmap?

  6. Are there any particular fonts or styling preferences you''d like for labels
  and annotations on the map?

  7. Would you like the map to have a specific title or subtitle?

  8. Do you want any additional filters (e.g., filter by make or year) to allow users
  to customize the visualization?

  9. Are there any specific geographic projections you prefer for the map (e.g., Mercator,
  Albers)?

  10. Do you have any preferences for how the trend data across different years should
  be displayed on the map?'
