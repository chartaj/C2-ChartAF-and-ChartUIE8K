initial_prompt: Create a dot plot comparing fuel costs and CO2 emissions for different
  car models by year. The x-axis should represent years, and the y-axis should show
  fuel costs. Each dot should be color-coded based on CO2 emissions values. Label
  the car models on the plot, and highlight the fuel type for clarity. This will help
  visualize the economic and environmental benefits of electric cars over time. Additionally,
  mark the 'guzzler' cars distinctly to emphasize high fuel consumption.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the CO2 emissions values?

  2. How would you like the ''guzzler'' cars to be marked (e.g., with a specific shape,
  size, or additional label)?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style and size used for the car model labels?

  4. Should there be a specific legend format or position for the CO2 emissions and
  fuel types?

  5. Would you like gridlines on the plot for better readability?

  6. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels and title format?

  7. Is there a specific range or scale for the x-axis (years) and y-axis (fuel costs)
  you would prefer?

  8. Should the data points include any tooltips or hover information for additional
  details?

  9. Do you have any preferred margin or spacing adjustments around the chart?

  10. Would you like any additional annotations or text boxes to highlight key insights?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the ''guzzler'' cars to be marked with a specific shape, like a
  star.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I am not sure.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines on the plot for better readability.

  6. No specific requirements, just clear and legible.

  7. I do not know.

  8. No, I am looking for an image, not interactive data.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, some additional annotations to highlight key insights would be helpful.'
