initial_prompt: Create a histogram displaying the fuel costs (fuelCost08) of different
  car models from the sample data. Highlight the models with the highest and lowest
  fuel costs. Add text annotations for these highlighted models, noting their fuel
  costs. This will help visualize money saving with an electric car.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the histogram?

  2. How would you like the highlighted models (highest and lowest fuel costs) to
  be displayed (e.g., different colors, patterns)?

  3. Do you have any specific preferences for the text annotations (e.g., font size,
  color, position)?

  4. What title would you like for the histogram?

  5. Do you want axis labels? If so, what should they be?

  6. Would you like a legend explaining the different colors or highlights?

  7. Are there any additional specific details or styles you want to include in the
  histogram?'
