initial_prompt: Create a column chart to visualize the fuel costs and CO2 emissions
  of cars from the sample data. Highlight the "ghgScore" column, and annotate the
  "fuelCost08" and "city08" columns to compare gas consumption and its impact on yearly
  fuel expenses. The purpose is to showcase the money-saving benefits of using electric
  or more fuel-efficient cars. Include text annotations for specific cars that stand
  out with the highest and lowest fuel costs and CO2 emissions to guide the user's
  attention. Use the year 1985 for context.
questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for highlighting the "ghgScore"
  column?

  2. Would you like a specific color scheme for the columns representing "fuelCost08"
  and "city08"?
