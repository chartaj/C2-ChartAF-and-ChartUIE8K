initial_prompt: 'Please create a heatmap using the provided automobile data to visualize
  the relationship between fuel costs (fuelCost08) and city fuel efficiency (city08)
  for different car makes and models. Highlight areas where electric cars have significant
  savings compared to regular gasoline vehicles. Use year as an additional layer to
  show change over time. Focus on columns: make, model, fuelCost08, city08, and year.
  Ensure the heatmap clearly shows which cars are the most cost-effective in city
  driving while highlighting the benefit of electric cars in terms of fuel-cost savings.'
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme of the heatmap?

  2. Would you like to include annotations or labels on the heatmap indicating the
  exact values of fuel cost and city fuel efficiency?

  3. How would you prefer to differentiate electric cars from regular gasoline vehicles
  on the heatmap (e.g., using different colors, patterns, or symbols)?

  4. Should the heatmap display the data for all years at once, or would you prefer
  to have an option to filter by specific years?

  5. Do you have any preference for the grid size or resolution of the heatmap (e.g.,
  finer or coarser grid)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend explaining the color intensities and any distinct
  markers used for different types of cars?'
