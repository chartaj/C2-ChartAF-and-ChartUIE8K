initial_prompt: Create a line chart highlighting the fuel cost over time for electric
  cars vs. regular gasoline cars. Annotate key data points to emphasize the cost savings
  when opting for an electric vehicle. This will help to showcase the cost efficiency
  and environmental benefits (lower CO2 emissions) of electric cars.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between electric
  cars and regular gasoline cars?

  2. Would you like a specific style for the line (e.g., dashed, solid) to represent
  electric cars and gasoline cars?

  3. Do you have a preference for the positioning and format of the annotations for
  key data points?

  4. Would you like to include any specific titles, labels, or legends on the chart?

  5. Do you want the chart to display exact numerical values for fuel cost at each
  time point?

  6. How detailed should the x-axis (year) ticks and labels be (e.g., every year,
  every five years)?

  7. Should the chart include a secondary y-axis to represent CO2 emissions, or should
  CO2 be displayed in another manner?

  8. Do you prefer a particular font style or size for the text on the chart?'
