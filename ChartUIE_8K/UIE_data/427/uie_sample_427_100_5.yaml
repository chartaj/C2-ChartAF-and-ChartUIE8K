initial_prompt: I need a stacked bar chart comparing fuel types for automobiles based
  on their CO2 emissions (co2TailpipeGpm) and fuel costs (fuelCost08) for the year
  1985. The X-axis should show different car models from the dataset, and the Y-axis
  should represent the values for CO2 emissions and fuel costs. Each stack within
  a bar should differentiate between CO2 emissions and fuel cost, with a legend to
  distinguish them. This chart should help visualize the impact of traditional gas
  vehicles in terms of emissions and expenses, to promote the idea of money saving
  with electric cars.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for differentiating
  between CO2 emissions and fuel costs in the stacked bar chart?

  2. How would you like the legend to be positioned on the chart?

  3. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and titles on the
  chart?

  4. Would you like to include data labels on the bars to show exact values of CO2
  emissions and fuel costs?

  5. Do you have any preferences regarding the scale of the Y-axis, such as logarithmic
  or linear?

  6. Should the car models on the X-axis be displayed in a particular order, such
  as alphabetical or based on emission values?

  7. Do you want any specific gridlines or reference lines included in the chart to
  enhance readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. No specific preference.

  4. Yes, I would like to include data labels on the bars to show exact values of
  CO2 emissions and fuel costs.

  5. I prefer a linear scale for the Y-axis.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. No specific preference.'
