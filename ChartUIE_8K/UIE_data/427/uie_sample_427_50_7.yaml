initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map showing the CO2 emissions (co2TailpipeAGpm)
  across different car models over the years. Use diverse color gradients to represent
  different emission levels, highlighting which models have the highest and lowest
  emissions.
questions: '1. What color gradients or color schemes do you prefer for representing
  different emission levels?

  2. Would you like to see distinct markers or highlights for the highest and lowest
  emission models, and if so, how should they be represented?

  3. Do you have a preference for the map projection type (e.g., Mercator, Albers,
  etc.)?

  4. Should the map include annotations or labels for specific car models or emission
  levels?

  5. Are there any specific legends or color bars that you prefer for better understanding
  the color gradients?

  6. Would you like to display additional information on hover or click, such as exact
  CO2 emission values or model details?

  7. Do you want to aggregate data by year, or show each year''s data individually?

  8. Are there specific year ranges or models you want to focus on or exclude from
  the visualization?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Yes, it would be nice to have distinct markers for the highest and lowest emission
  models. Perhaps using bold outlines or distinct icons for them.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Yes, including annotations or labels for specific car models or emission levels
  would be useful.

  5. I have no specific preference.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I prefer to aggregate data by year.

  8. I do not know.'
