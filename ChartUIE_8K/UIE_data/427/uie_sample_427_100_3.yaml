initial_prompt: Create a box chart to compare city and highway mileage for different
  car makes and models from the 1985 dataset. Include medians, quartiles, and outliers
  for both "city08" (city mileage) and "highway08" (highway mileage) columns. Use
  different colors for city and highway data points. The chart should help visualize
  the fuel efficiency distribution across various automobiles from that year. Highlight
  the make and model of cars with the highest and lowest mileages. The goal is to
  identify which cars were most fuel-efficient in the city and on the highway.
questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the type of color palette used for differentiating
  city and highway mileage data points?

  2. Would you like specific annotations or labels on the chart for makes and models
  with the highest and lowest mileages?

  3. Are there any particular fonts or font sizes you''d prefer for the chart titles,
  axis labels, or data labels?

  4. Do you prefer a specific orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish between city and highway mileage
  colors?

  6. Are there any specific plot gridlines you prefer (none, major, minor, both)?

  7. Do you have any preference for the aspect ratio of the chart?

  8. Would you like to include tooltips or hover text for additional data insights
  when viewing the chart?'
