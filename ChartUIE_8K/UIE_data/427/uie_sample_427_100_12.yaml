initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart using the provided data to compare fuel
  cost (fuelCost08) across different makes and models of cars for the year 1985. Each
  group should represent a different car make, and within each group, display bars
  for each model. The x-axis should represent the car makes and models, while the
  y-axis should represent the fuel cost. This will help visualize the money-saving
  potential by considering different car options. Make sure to include labels for
  clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for the bars in the chart?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to differentiate between models within makes?

  3. Do you want gridlines on the chart for easier comparison of values?

  4. Are there specific font preferences for the labels and axis titles?

  5. Should we display the exact fuel cost values on top of each bar for clarity?

  or angled?
