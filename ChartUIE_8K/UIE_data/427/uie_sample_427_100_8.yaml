initial_prompt: Create an area chart highlighting the fuel costs (fuelCost08), CO2
  emissions (co2TailpipeGpm), and combined MPG (comb08) for various car models and
  makes across different years. This will help visualize the savings potential and
  environmental impact of transitioning to electric cars. Focus on data trends over
  time to showcase improvements in fuel efficiency and reductions in emissions. Make
  sure to differentiate the data for electric cars versus traditional gasoline cars.
  This chart will be useful for those considering the switch to electric vehicles
  to understand the long-term savings and benefits.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating between electric
  cars and traditional gasoline cars?

  2. How would you prefer the time axis to be displayed (e.g., specific intervals,
  from oldest to newest, or vice versa)?

  3. Would you like to display data points with markers on the area chart?

  4. Do you have any specific preferences for the chart title and axis labels?

  5. Would you prefer the chart to display a legend? If so, where would you like it
  positioned (e.g., top, bottom, right, left)?

  6. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. From oldest to newest.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I don''t have any specific preferences.

  5. Yes, top.

  6. I do not know.'
