initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart comparing the average MonthlyIncome and
  YearsAtCompany for each JobRole in the IBM HR dataset. Group bars by JobRole, and
  the bars should represent both metrics (MonthlyIncome and YearsAtCompany) side by
  side for easy comparison. This should help visualize how these two factors vary
  across different roles.
questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the bars representing
  ''MonthlyIncome'' and ''YearsAtCompany''?

  2. Would you prefer the bars to be displayed with specific patterns (e.g., stripes,
  dots) for easier differentiation?

  3. How would you like the JobRoles to be ordered on the x-axis (e.g., alphabetically,
  by average MonthlyIncome, by YearsAtCompany)?

  4. Should the chart include data labels on the bars to indicate the exact values
  of the averages?

  5. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the chart labels and legend?

  6. Would you like to include a grid or reference lines to enhance readability?

  7. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  8. Do you want to include subtitles or annotations to provide additional context
  or insights?

  9. Should there be any specific margins or padding around the chart for better aesthetics?
