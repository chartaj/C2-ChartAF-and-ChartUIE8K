initial_prompt: Could you create a grouped bar chart to visualize the comparison of
  'MonthlyIncome' and 'YearsAtCompany' for different 'JobRoles'? I want to see how
  income and tenure vary across different job roles. Please group the bars by 'JobRole'
  and use different colors or patterns to differentiate between 'MonthlyIncome' and
  'YearsAtCompany'. Make sure the chart has appropriate labels and a legend for clarity.
  This will help in understanding the income distribution and retention based on different
  roles within the company. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific preferences for the color scheme or patterns
  used to differentiate between ''MonthlyIncome'' and ''YearsAtCompany''?

  2. What title would you like for the chart?

  3. Do you have any specific requirements for the axis labels?

  4. Are there any particular font styles and sizes you prefer for the labels and
  legend?

  5. Would you like to include grid lines in the background of the chart?

  6. Is there a specific way you want the legend to be formatted or positioned?

  7. Do you prefer any specific ordering for the ''JobRole'' categories on the x-axis?

  8. Do you have any preferences for the overall style or theme of the chart (e.g.,
  minimalistic, professional, colorful)?'

  is clearly visible.
