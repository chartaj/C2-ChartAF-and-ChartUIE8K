initial_prompt: I'd like a line chart showing the trend of monthly income over years
  at the company for IBM employees. Use the sample data provided, and plot "YearsAtCompany"
  on the X-axis and "MonthlyIncome" on the Y-axis. Highlight different job roles and
  differentiate gender using different line styles or colors. This will help visualize
  how monthly income potentially grows with the number of years employees spend at
  the company and how this trend varies across job roles and between genders.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for differentiating the genders?

  2. What line styles would you prefer for different job roles (e.g., solid, dashed,
  dotted)?

  3. Is there a specific title you would like for the chart?

  4. Do you have any preference for the labels on the X-axis and Y-axis?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to denote different genders and job roles?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations or data points highlighted on the chart?

  7. Should the chart include gridlines? If so, in which style (e.g., dashed, solid)?

  8. Do you wish to display data values on the line chart for specific points?

  9. Would you like the chart to have any specific background color or pattern?

  10. Do you prefer the lines to be smoothed or to be plotted as straight segments?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. Solid for one job role, dashed for another, and dotted for a third would be fine.

  3. "Income Growth Over Years at IBM" would be a good title.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Yes, please include a legend to denote different genders and job roles.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I donâ€™t have any specific preference for background color or pattern.

  10. I prefer straight segments.'
