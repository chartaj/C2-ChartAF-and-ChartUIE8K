initial_prompt: I need a box chart visualizing the Palmer Penguins dataset, focusing
  on bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass across different species
  and islands. Highlight outliers and display data-driven text annotations for key
  elements like median values and notable outliers. Incorporate elements to distinguish
  sex differences visually. The purpose is to explore species differences and trends
  while drawing attention to specifics like extreme values. The chart should provide
  an intuitive overview of penguin species' physical characteristics for environmental-science
  research. Ensure missing values are handled appropriately for clarity.
questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between different
  species and sex differences?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be highlighted? (e.g., color, shape, size)

  3. What kind of text annotations do you prefer for median values and notable outliers?
  (e.g., labels, tooltips)

  4. Are there any specific font styles or sizes you would like for text annotations?

  5. How should missing values be handled in the visualization? (e.g., removing them,
  imputing with mean/median values)

  6. Do you have a preference for the orientation of the box chart (horizontal/vertical)?

  7. What level of detail would you like in the axis labels and legends? (e.g., full
  names, abbreviations)

  8. Should the plot include any grid lines or background shading for better readability?'
answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like outliers to be highlighted using a different color and shape.

  3. Labels would be preferred for text annotations for median values and notable
  outliers.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for font styles or sizes.

  5. Please remove the missing values for clarity.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Full names for axis labels and legends would be ideal.

  8. I am not sure.'
