initial_prompt: Create a line chart comparing the bill length and flipper length over
  the years for different penguin species in the Palmer Penguins Dataset.
questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different penguin
  species?

  2. How would you like the years to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., every year,
  every other year)?

  3. Should the chart include data points for each year, or would you prefer a smoothed
  line without data points?

  4. Do you prefer to see both bill length and flipper length on the same chart, or
  would you like separate charts for each measurement?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish the different penguin species,
  or should the species be labeled directly on the line?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the y-axis have a fixed range for better comparison, or would you prefer
  it to adjust automatically based on the data?

  8. Would you like to display gridlines for better readability, and if so, how prominently
  should they be displayed?

  9. Do you want to highlight any specific trends or years in the chart with annotations
  or markers?

  10. Are there any additional elements you want to include, such as a title, subtitle,
  or footnotes?'
