initial_prompt: Create a histogram of the flipper_length_mm from the Palmer Penguins
  Dataset to show the distribution of flipper lengths. Annotate the histogram with
  text annotations highlighting the mean and median values of the flipper lengths
  to give viewers a better understanding of the central tendency and spread of this
  attribute. Use different colors to highlight the bars representing values above
  and below these central points, emphasizing any potential skewness in the data.
  The visualization should serve to underscore important insights for environmental
  science study applications.
questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for highlighting bars above and
  below the mean and median values?

  2. Do you have a preference for the number of bins used in the histogram?

  3. Would you like any specific text or font style for the annotations?

  4. Is there a particular size or aspect ratio you prefer for the histogram?

  5. Do you have any specific requirements for the chart title and axis labels?

  6. Would you like grid lines included in the histogram for better readability?'
