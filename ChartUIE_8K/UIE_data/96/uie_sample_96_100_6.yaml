initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart using the Palmer Penguins Dataset
  from environmental science. The chart should compare the mean body mass of different
  species of penguins across various islands. Make sure the x-axis represents different
  species and the bars within each species group represent different islands. Each
  bar's height should reflect the average body mass (in grams). Use different colors
  to distinguish between the islands. This will help visualize how body mass varies
  by species and island location. Thank you!
questions: '1. Do you have any specific colors in mind for representing the different
  islands?

  2. What title would you prefer for the chart?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the labels on the x-axis and y-axis?

  4. Would you like to include gridlines in the background for better readability?
  If so, do you have a preference for their appearance?

  5. Do you want to display the exact numerical values of the mean body mass on each
  bar?

  6. Do you have any preferences for the font style or size for the labels and title?

  7. Would you like to include a legend to identify the islands? If so, where should
  it be positioned?'
