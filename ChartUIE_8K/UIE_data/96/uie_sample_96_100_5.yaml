initial_prompt: I have a dataset of Palmer Penguins with details like species, island,
  bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. I need to visualize
  this data using a Violin plot. Could you create a Violin plot that shows the distribution
  of body mass across different species and islands? Highlight how the body mass varies
  between male and female penguins within each species on different islands. This
  will help in identifying any significant differences in body mass based on species
  and location. Thank you!
questions: '1. What color palette do you prefer for distinguishing between different
  species and sexes?

  2. Would you like to include a legend to explain the color coding for species and
  sexes?

  3. Do you have a specific preference for the orientation of the violin plot (vertical
  or horizontal)?

  4. Do you prefer to include gridlines in the plot for better readability?

  5. Should the violin plot include individual data points overlayed or just the distribution?

  6. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to add for the islands
  or species on the plot?

  7. Would you prefer to use different line styles for males and females within the
  same species?

  8. Do you have a preference for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear, log)?

  9. Would you like to display summary statistics (mean, median) within the plot?'
