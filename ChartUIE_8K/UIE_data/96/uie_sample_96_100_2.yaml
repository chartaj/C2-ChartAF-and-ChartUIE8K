initial_prompt: '<start of instructions>

  Create a scatter plot visualizing the Palmer Penguins dataset focusing on ''bill_length_mm''
  vs ''bill_depth_mm''. Color the points based on species and differentiate by sex
  using different shapes. Highlight missing values to emphasize data gaps. Annotate
  specific outliers and key points to draw attention to interesting data insights.
  This visualization will help in understanding the relationship between bill dimensions
  among different species and genders of penguins. Ensure to provide contextual annotations
  and highlights for better interpretability.

questions: '1. Do you have any specific color palette preferences for differentiating
  between the species?

  2. What shapes do you prefer to use for differentiating between the sexes?

  3. How would you like the missing values to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  shape, or outline)?

  4. Do you have any specific requirements for annotating outliers and key points
  (e.g., text size, font, color)?

  5. Are there any specific points or ranges you would like to emphasize with additional
  annotations or highlights?

  6. Do you prefer a particular style for the chart title and axis labels (e.g., font
  type, size, color)?

  7. Do you want a legend for species, sex, and missing values displayed? If yes,
  do you have any preferences for its placement?

  8. Are there any additional contextual annotations or labels that you would like
  to include in the chart?'
answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference.

  2. I am not sure about the shapes for differentiating between the sexes.

  3. Highlight missing values with a different color.

  4. I do not have any specific requirements for annotating outliers and key points.

  5. I do not have specific points or ranges in mind to emphasize.

  6. I have no specific preference for the chart title and axis labels style.

  7. Yes, please include a legend for species, sex, and missing values, but I have
  no specific preference for its placement.

  8. No additional contextual annotations or labels are needed.'
