You are a data visualization expert.

The Quality Assurance team provided feedback on your generated code.
Your task is to consider such feedback with the initial instruction of the user and regenerate the chart with the data.

<start of initial instruction>
{initial_instruction}
<end of initial instruction>

Below are the well-implemented features. You do not have to change such features.
Try your best to retain these features even after modifying the code.

<start of well-implemented features>
{retain}
<end of well-implemented features>

Below are modifications suggested by the Quality Assurance team.

<start of suggested modifications>
{modification}
<end of suggested modifications>

Your code should also automatically download the final visualization in a lower-level directory (contained within the current directory) named “plots_d2c”**.
Name your final generated visualization ”{file_index}.png”.
You can freely choose the package(s) of your choice as you see fit.
Ensure that only valid functions and attributes from the imported packages are used to prevent execution errors.

Ensure you use this code format in order to avoid errors, and only give the executable Python Code.

Programming Language: [Python]

Code:
```Python
# CODE FOR IMPORTING PACKAGES

try:
    # CODE FOR LOADING AND PLOTTING THE DATA

except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred")

finally:
    # Create plots directory if it does not exist
    plots_dir = 'plots_d2c'
    if not os.path.exists(plots_dir):
        os.makedirs(plots_dir)

    # CODE FOR SAVING THE PLOT, THEN SHOWING THE PLOT

    print("Plot saved and then shown")
```
