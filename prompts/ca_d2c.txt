You are an expert data visualizer.

The following instruction asks you to generate code for data visualization of the underlying data file that we have attached.
I will give you the data, but you can ignore some parts from the data if it is not necessary and unrelated to the instruction.
Assume that the data file that has been attached in the path “{data_path}” in the generated code.
The file format of the data is **f”.json or .csv”.**
Your code should include loading the data file, and check and verify the data type and representation of the data to avoid errors while executing.

<start of data format>
{data}
<end of data format>

Your code should also automatically download the final visualization in a lower level directory (contained within the current directory) named “plots_d2c”.
You MUST name your final generated visualization as ”{file_index}.png”.
You can freely choose package(s) that work best to make the visualization.

Here is the instruction set:

<start of initial instruction>
{initial_instruction}
<end of initial instruction>

<start of further instruction>
Questions:
{Q}
Answers:
{A}
<end of further instruction>

Ensure you use this code format in order to avoid errors, and only give the executable Python Code.

Programming Language: [Python]

Code:
```Python
# CODE FOR IMPORTING PACKAGES

try:
    # CODE FOR LOADING AND PLOTTING THE DATA

except Exception as e:
    print("An error occurred", e)

finally:
    # Create plots directory if it does not exist
    plots_dir = 'plots_d2c'
    if not os.path.exists(plots_dir):
        os.makedirs(plots_dir)

    # CODE FOR SAVING THE PLOT, THEN SHOWING THE PLOT

    print("Plot saved and then shown")
```
