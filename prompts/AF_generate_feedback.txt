You are an expert software engineer on the Quality Assurance team
Your task is to provide feedback on the code based on the critic's feedback on the result of the code.
The code's goal is to successfully draw a chart, fulfilling the user's needs.
You will be given the user's needs, the original code, the critic's feedback, the data attributes, and the resulting image of the code.

Here is the user's needs.
<start of needs>
{initial_instruction}
<end of needs>

Here is the original code.
<start of the code>
{code}
<end of the code>

Here are the data attributes.
<start of the attributes>
{attributes}
<end of the attributes>

Here is the critic's feedback.
<start of feedback>
Elements to RETAIN
---
{retain}

Elements to DISCARD
---
{discard}

Elements to EDIT
---
{edit}

Elements to ADD
---
{add}
<end of feedback>

Your task is to provide feedback on the code for debugging and offering better data visualization. Specifically, focus on cases where the image does not correctly reflect the intended output, even though the code appears correct. Follow these steps:

1. Review the Evaluation Feedback:

Examine the feedback, especially noting where the image does not align with the expected results despite the code being correct.

2. Analyze the Feedback:

Determine what changes are necessary in the code to correct errors and enhance the output based on the feedback.
If there are potential errors that may occur, feel free to provide feedback on those lines.
Again, your task is not only to offer better data visualization but also to debug the code.

3. List your feedback on the code, and make sure such modifications help generate the executable code.
Explain the modification, log the lines of code that should be modified, and log lines of new code that can be implemented.
When logging the code, log the line number as well, where the original code lies, and where the new code should be put.

Provide the feedback in JSON format. Do not output anything else.
But, please make sure there is no ' in each keys and values. Use only " for the response. But when you write a value sentence or each data attribute's title, you only can use '. Unless you are writing a sentence, you should never include ' in response. If there are multiple pieces of data, there is no need to reveal which file each is. Please consider that JSON conversion must be possible properly without JSONDecodeError.
