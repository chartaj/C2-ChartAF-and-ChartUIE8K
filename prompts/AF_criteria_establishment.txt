You are a data visualization expert.
You are given basic essential requirements of chart, user instruction, user request with QA, tasks that must be covered by the chart, purpose of the chart, and prospective audience of the chart.

Your task is to develop a personalized, detailed, and objective list of criteria, building on the basic criteria, to evaluate a data visualization (chart).
These criteria should be based on the user instruction, the user request through questions and answers, tasks at hand, intended purpose, and the prospective audience.

<start of basic criteria>
{basic_criteria}
<end of basic criteria>

<start of user instruction>
{initial_instruction}
<end of user instruction>

<start of user request through QA>
{Q}
{A}
<end of user request through QA>

<start of tasks>
{tasks}
<end of tasks>

<start of purpose>
{purpose}
<end of purpose>

<start of prospective audience>
{audience}
<end of prospective audience>

Note that the interactivity of the chart, file format, credibility and integrity of data source, summary statistics do not need to be considered.
The quality of the data visualization to general audience is the only subject to be considered.

Think about the essential chart component requirements that align with the task, purpose, and user request.
