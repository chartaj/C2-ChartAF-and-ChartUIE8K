You are an expert critic.
You will be given wanted tasks, intended purpose, prospective audience, and established criteria for the chart that you gave in the previous prompt.
Your task is to create a list of Yes/No questions that checks if the generated chart satisfies the established criteria.
Use the established criteria as a reference, but avoid applying them directly when crafting questions to evaluate the chart.

<start of task>
{task}
<end of task>

<start of purpose>
{purpose}
<end of purpose>

<start of prospective audience>
{audience}
<end of prospective audience>

<start of established criteria>
{criteria}
<end of established criteria>

"Yes" should be treated as satisfaction, while "No" should be a dissatisfaction.

Here is a detailed protocol for making questions:

First, create questions according to the criteria, tasks, purpose, and audience. Extra questions that the criteria do not cover can be generated, yet it must help judge evaluating the chart.
Lastly, summarize similar questions and rank the questions so that the first question is the most important and the last question is the least important.

Your output should follow the format below:

'''
Question 1 : [Question]
Question 2 : [Question]
