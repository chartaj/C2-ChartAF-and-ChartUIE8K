The choice must consider the inherent spacing requirements and the context in which the chart will be used, ensuring clarity and comprehension.\n\n        Visual Embellishment\n        - Use embellishments to enhance understanding without overwhelming the data. Visual embellishments, like icons, patterns, or textures, should be used sparingly and purposefully to make the chart memorable and engaging while maintaining a balance that does not distract from the core data.\n        \n        Text\n        - Prioritize legibility and adhere to consistent textual criteria.

Don't give anything else like N/A.\nWith the answers, you need to give feedback.\n\nWhen answering the questions, follow the step-by-step protocol below:\n\n1. Determine and tag whether the question is subjective or fact-checking:\n- Fact-checking: Verify if the chart image meets the criteria directly based on the visual content. If the image shows any deviation from the criteria, answer NO. If the image meets the criteria, answer YES.\n- Subjective: Consider whether the image meets the criteria based on visual appeal, clarity, and other subjective measures. Provide reasons for both YES and NO answers. If there is clear evidence to support a YES and no substantial reasons to support a NO, answer YES. Answer NO otherwise.\n\n2. Answer the questions and provide feedback:\n\nAfter answering each question, provide feedback explaining your evaluation.\nList potential improvements categorized as RETAIN, DISCARD, EDIT, or ADD if necessary.\n\nFeedback Classification:\n\nRETAIN: Identify and specify any elements that should be retained even after the improvement.\nDISCARD: Identify and specify any elements that should be discarded for better visualization.\nEDIT: Specify edits needed in the image to satisfy the user's request. Provide examples if applicable.\nADD: Identify and specify elements that should be added for better visualization of the user's initial prompt.\n\nTo help your task, here is the user's initial prompt.\n\n<start of initial prompt>\nCreate a grouped bar chart comparing methane emissions (CH4) from different countries across years (1990-2018). Highlight significant differences in emissions between the sectors 'Total including LUCF' and 'Total excluding LUCF'.

Specifically, focus on cases where the image does not correctly reflect the intended output, even though the code appears correct. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Review the Evaluation Feedback:\n\nExamine the feedback, especially noting where the image does not align with the expected results despite the code being correct.\n\n2. Analyze the Feedback:\n\nDetermine what changes are necessary in the code to correct errors and enhance the output based on the feedback.\nIf there are potential errors that may occur, feel free to provide feedback on those lines.\nAgain, your task is not only to offer better data visualization but also to debug the code.\n\n3. List your feedback on the code, and make sure such modifications help generate the executable code.\nExplain the modification, log the lines of code that should be modified, and log lines of new code that can be implemented.\nWhen logging the code, log the line number as well, where the original code lies, and where the new code should be put.\n\nProvide the feedback in JSON format. Do not output anything else.\nBut, please make sure there is no ' in each keys and values. Use only \" for the response. But when you write a value sentence or each data attribute's title, you only can use '. Unless you are writing a sentence, you should never include ' in response. If there are multiple pieces of data, there is no need to reveal which file each is. Please consider that JSON conversion must be possible properly without JSONDecodeError.\n\n'''json\n{\n    \"code feedback\":[\n        {\n            \"tag\": <RETAIN or DISCARD or EDIT or ADD>,\n            \"explanation\": <Explanation on the modification>,\n            \"before\": [\"Line <line number>: <lines of code before the modification>\", ...]\n            \"after\": [\"Line <line number>: <lines of code after the modification>\", ...]\n        },\n        ...\n    ]\n}\n'''",
