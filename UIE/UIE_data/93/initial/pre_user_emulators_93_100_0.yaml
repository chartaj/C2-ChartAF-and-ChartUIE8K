2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart to visualize the world population growth from 1951 onwards
  using the provided data. Highlight years with significant yearly growth percentages.
  Use text annotations to display the population figures at key points, illustrating
  major trends and milestones. Ensure the X-axis represents the years and the Y-axis
  represents the population in billions. Differentiate yearly growth rates with varying
  shades or colors to emphasize changes over decades. This will help us understand
  historical population trends and growth patterns, which is crucial for social science
  studies and policy-making. Please focus on making the chart clear and visually informative.
