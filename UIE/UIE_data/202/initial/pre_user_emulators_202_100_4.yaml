  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually.\n<end of the annotation\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Choropleth map that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Choropleth map
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Hi, I'd like a choropleth map created to visualize the distribution of different
  genders across countries using data from the Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset.
  This map should highlight the number of individuals of different genders from various
  countries. Make sure to use the columns 'country' and 'gender' for this visualization.
  It would be helpful if the map uses different colors to represent the different
  genders, making it easy to see where participants are from and their gender distribution
  in each country. Thanks!
