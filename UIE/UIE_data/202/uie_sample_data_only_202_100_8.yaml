09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. 10-year intervals, like 20-29, 30-39, and 40-49, would be fine.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. Yes, please include data labels showing the count of individuals on the bars.

  5. I do not have a specific preference for the style or formatting of the axis labels
  and titles.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to distinguish the age groups, positioned to the
  right of the chart.

  7. I am not sure.

  8. Yes, a title would be great. Maybe something like "Age and Gender Distribution
  in Facial Emotion Recognition Dataset".

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure.'
