02_initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot analyzing the Supermart Grocery Sales dataset.
  Plot 'Sales' on the x-axis and 'Profit' on the y-axis to visualize the relationship
  between sales figures and profit margins. Differentiate the data points by 'Category'
  using distinct colors. Include data labels for 'City' to highlight regional sales
  performance. Ensure the plot is easily interpretable for business insights and decision-making
  in retail analytics. Use a legend to identify categories and add trend lines if
  necessary. The plot should offer a clear visual representation to support optimized
  sales strategies and profitability analysis for Supermart.
