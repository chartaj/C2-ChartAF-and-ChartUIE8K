  Focus on the distribution of sales across different categories like 'Oil & Masala',
  'Beverages', and 'Food Grains'. Highlight the segments with unique colors to distinguish
  them. Include text annotations to show the sales amount for major categories. This
  will help in quickly understanding which category drives the most sales. Adding
  context or editorial comments via non-data-driven annotations could offer insights
  into why certain categories perform better. The goal is to provide clear, actionable
  insights on sales distribution to inform business decisions.
