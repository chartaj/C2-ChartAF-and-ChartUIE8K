  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a violin plot visualizing the distribution of 'Volume' over 'Date' for META
  Stock Historical Prices. Highlight data points on significant trading days, like
  unusually high or low volumes, using different colors and sizes. Add text annotations
  for these highlighted points to draw attention to their specific values. Ensure
  the plot's design emphasizes trends and variations in trading volume over time while
  providing context on particularly active trading days. This visualization will help
  in analyzing trading behaviors and market responses over the provided timeframe.
  Make sure to format the dates on the x-axis for better readability.
