  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bars, especially to
  differentiate ''Outcome'' groups (0 and 1)?

  2. Would you like to include error bars to represent variability or standard deviation?

  3. Do you have a preferred font size and style for the text annotations?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to describe what each color represents?

  5. Are there specific axis titles or labels you prefer for the X and Y axes?

  8. Is there a specific order you would like the factors (''BMI'', ''Age'', ''Glucose'')
  to be displayed on the chart?

  9. Would you like to use specific thresholds to annotate high/low values, or should
  it be automatically determined based on the data?

  10. Should the bars be displayed with a specific width or spacing between groups?
