  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Box chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Box chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a box chart for the dataset in '../Extra_datas/data/123.csv'. I want
  the box chart to show the distribution of 'Price' across different 'Color' categories.
  This will help us understand how the prices vary based on different colors in the
  given time periods. Additionally, make sure to highlight any outliers that might
  be present in the data. This visualization will be useful for our arts-and-entertainment
  project, Win-Go, focused on color prediction trends. Data accuracy is crucial, so
  ensure the chart reflects all price ranges accurately.
