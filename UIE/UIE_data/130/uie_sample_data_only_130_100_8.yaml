02_initial_prompt: Create a Treemap visualization for the Indian Food 101 dataset.
  Use the 'state' column to categorize the dishes and the 'prep_time' and 'cook_time'
  columns to denote the size of each square in the Treemap. Each food item should
  be a leaf node within its state category. Color-code the leaves based on the 'flavor_profile'
  column, differentiating between 'sweet' and other flavors. Make sure each state's
  section is easily distinguishable, allowing for quick comparison of preparation
  times across different dishes and states. This will help visualize regional cooking
  times for Indian cuisine.
