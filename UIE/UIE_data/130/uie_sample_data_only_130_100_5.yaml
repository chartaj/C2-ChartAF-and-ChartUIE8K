02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of Indian food based
  on prep_time and cook_time across different states and regions. Plot prep_time on
  the x-axis and cook_time on the y-axis. Each cell should represent the frequency
  of recipes with specific prep_time and cook_time combinations, differentiated by
  states and regions. Use different color gradients to indicate varying frequencies.
  This will help in understanding which regions have foods with longer or shorter
  cooking and preparation times. This is useful for food enthusiasts and researchers
  interested in regional cooking patterns in Indian cuisine.
