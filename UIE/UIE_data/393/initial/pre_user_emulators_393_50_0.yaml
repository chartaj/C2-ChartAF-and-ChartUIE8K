2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart showing the distribution of collaborations among universities,
  highlighting significant nodes like Harvard, MIT, and Stanford. Add text annotations
  for these key universities to emphasize their contribution. This will help visualize
  academic partnerships effectively.
