  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the treemap?

  2. Would you like different colors or patterns to represent missing or incomplete
  connections?

  3. Do you need specific labels on the nodes or connections within the treemap?

  5. Should the size of the nodes reflect the number of connections or any other specific
  metric?

  6. Do you prefer any particular font style and size for the labels on nodes?

  7. Is there a specific way you would like the missing or incomplete connections
  to be highlighted (e.g., different colors, dashed lines, etc.)?'
