02_initial_prompt: Please create a dot plot chart to visualize the Disease Symptoms
  and Patient Profile dataset. For each disease, plot the presence of fever, cough,
  fatigue, and difficulty breathing as separate categories on the x-axis. Each dot
  should represent an individual patient's data, with different colors for genders
  and sizes to show age variations. Include a legend for blood pressure and cholesterol
  level categories. The dot plot should also show the outcome variable (positive/negative)
  distinctly. This will help in analyzing patterns and correlations between symptoms
  and patient profiles effectively. Thank you!

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific color palette preference for representing
  genders.

  2. I would prefer to categorize age groups, but I am not sure how to do it. Maybe
  you can suggest a common approach?

  3. I do not have any specific preferences for the shape of the dots.

  4. I am not sure about the order of symptoms on the x-axis. You can choose an order
  that makes sense.

  5. I do not know. You can decide the best way to display the legend for blood pressure
  and cholesterol level categories.'
