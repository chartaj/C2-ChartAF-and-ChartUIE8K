02_initial_prompt: Please create a grouped column chart using the Disease Symptoms
  and Patient Profile Dataset. The chart should display the number of patients experiencing
  each symptom (Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Difficulty Breathing) grouped by disease type.
  Each group should represent one disease, and each column within the group should
  represent the symptoms for that disease. Label the x-axis with the disease types
  and the y-axis with the number of patients. Also, ensure that you include a legend
  to indicate which color represents which symptom. This visualization will help in
  comparing symptom distribution across different diseases. Thank you!

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
