  1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. I would like population size to be represented through a color gradation that
  becomes darker with larger populations.

  4. Yes, please include a legend to explain the colors for population size and indicate
  which colors correspond to which continents.

  5. Linear scaling would be preferred for both axes.

  6. Yes, please include a title. The title should be "Relationship between Life Expectancy
  and GDP per Capita across Continents".
