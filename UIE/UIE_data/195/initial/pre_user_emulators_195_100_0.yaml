2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap to visualize the 'Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number' over time.
  Use the 'Date' column for the x-axis and 'Monthly Mean Total Sunspot Number' for
  the y-axis. Employ text annotations to highlight specific years where sunspot activity
  was notably high or low. Add color variations to emphasize changes in sunspot numbers.
  The purpose is to analyze long-term trends in solar activity. Ensure the visualization
  is clear and focuses on significant fluctuations in sunspot numbers, aiding in space
  and astronomy studies. Highlight peaks and troughs to make them easily identifiable.
