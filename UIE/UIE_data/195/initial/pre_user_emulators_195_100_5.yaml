  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\

  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Radial histogram that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Radial histogram
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I have a dataset detailing the monthly mean total sunspot numbers from 1749 onwards,
  with columns for date and sunspot number. Could you create a radial histogram to
  visualize the distribution of the sunspot numbers over time? Each bin should represent
  a range of sunspot numbers, and the radius should indicate a specific time period.
  The goal is to understand the sunspot activity patterns over time visually. Please
  include a legend and clear axis labels for better comprehension.
