  1. I am not sure.

  2. Sequential will be fine.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I don''t have specific years in mind.

  5. I am not sure, but maybe the last 100 years.

  6. Yes, showing grid lines would be helpful.

  7. Yearly labels should be good.

  8. Yes, please include a legend explaining the color variations.

  9. Keep it simple but detailed enough to differentiate between significant changes.

  10. I do not know of any specific peaks or troughs.
