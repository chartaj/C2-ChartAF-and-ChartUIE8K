  sunspot numbers over the years. Specifically, I want to see how these distributions
  have changed over centuries. I imagine partitioning the data by century or decades
  could highlight any long-term trends or patterns in sunspot activity. Ensure that
  the x-axis represents time (years), and the y-axis shows the Monthly Mean Total

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
