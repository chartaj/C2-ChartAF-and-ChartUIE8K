  from the provided dataset. The data includes wine reviews, and each review has an
  assigned point score. Focus on the "points" column and categorize the wines into
  different point ranges (e.g., 80-84, 85-89, 90-94, 95-100). Display the percentage
  of wines that fall into each point range. The chart should help identify the most
