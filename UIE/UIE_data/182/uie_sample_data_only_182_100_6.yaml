02_initial_prompt: I want to visualize the distribution of the number of books based
  on their average rating. Can you create a histogram showing "Book_average_rating"
  on the x-axis and the number of books on the y-axis? Include labels for clarity.
  This will help understand the spread and common ratings among books in the dataset.
  Make sure to include a title and proper axis labels so it's easy to understand.
  A little color differentiation would be nice to make it visually appealing and easily
  interpretable. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
