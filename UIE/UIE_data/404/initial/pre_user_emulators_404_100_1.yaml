2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Plot a scatter plot with the given data where the x-axis represents 'date' and the
  y-axis represents 'profit'. Include text annotations for the top 5 highest profits
  to highlight key data points, focusing viewer attention on these significant values.
  Use different colors or sizes to highlight these data points effectively. The chart
  should visually showcase the profit trend over the given dates, aiding in the analysis
  of business performance for the popup store sector. Incorporate any context or editorial
  comments directly within the visual for clarity and better insight.
