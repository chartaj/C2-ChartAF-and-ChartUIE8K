  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a specific color gradient to indicate the strength of
  the correlation?

  values?

  4. Is there a specific time interval (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) you prefer for
  aggregating the data?

  5. Are there any specific date ranges or time periods you would like to focus on
  or highlight?

  6. Should significant changes be indicated with special markers or annotations?
