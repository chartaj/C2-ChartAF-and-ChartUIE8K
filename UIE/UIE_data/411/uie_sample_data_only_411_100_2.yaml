  <start of data visualization instruction>

  Create a scatter plot to visualize the declining urban population figures globally,
  using the provided data on urban population percentages from 1960 to 2020 for various
  countries. Highlight markers should be used to emphasize significant drops in urban
  population percentages. Include text annotations for the years where the most considerable
  changes occur to draw attention. Make sure the x-axis represents the years and the
  y-axis represents the urban population percentage. Use different colors for each
  country to distinguish them easily. The visualization aims to provide a clear, comparative
  overview of urban population trends over the decades.
