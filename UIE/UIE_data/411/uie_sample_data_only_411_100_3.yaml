  <start of data visualization instruction>

  I''d like to see a bar chart visualizing the urban population percentage trend from
  1960 to 2020 for three countries: Aruba, Afghanistan, and Angola. The x-axis should
  show the years, and the y-axis should display the urban population percentages.
  Use different colors to represent each country in the chart. This visualization
  will help us understand how urbanization has changed over time in these countries,
  aligning with our analysis of worldwide declining urban population figures in social
  sciences. Please ensure the chart is clear and easy to read. Thank you!
