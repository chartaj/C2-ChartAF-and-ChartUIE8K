  to compare the number of suicides between different age groups and years for both
  males and females. Ensure that the x-axis represents the age groups, the y-axis
  represents the number of suicides, and use different colors or patterns to distinguish
  between the years. Include labels and a legend to clearly differentiate between
  male and female populations. Omitting missing values, ensure data accuracy and take
