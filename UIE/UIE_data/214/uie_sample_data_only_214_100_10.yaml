  age and sex. I have a dataset with columns like country, year, sex, age, suicides_no,
  and population. I need a population pyramid chart showing the distribution of the
  population across different age groups and sexes for one specific country, preferably
  Albania, in the year 1985. The chart should highlight both the male and female populations
  in these age categories. The purpose is to provide a visual representation of the
  data for easier understanding and comparison. This will help in observing population
  distribution patterns related to suicide statistics.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.
