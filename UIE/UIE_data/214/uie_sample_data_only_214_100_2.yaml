  1. I do not have any specific preferences.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend to denote age groups, sexes, and countries
  distinctly.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The annotations should be detailed enough to provide relevant context but not
  overly cluttered.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Clear and descriptive axis labels and titles that specify the years, number of
  suicides, and demographic categories would be helpful.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I am not sure.
