02_initial_prompt: I need a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the week
  position and weeks on chart for Christmas songs that made it to the Billboard charts.
  Each point should represent a song and be color-coded by the performer. Additionally,
  include data labels for the peak positions. Please use the provided data fields
  like song, performer, week_position, and weeks_on_chart. This will help visualize
  how long each Christmas song stayed on the chart relative to its position. Thanks!
