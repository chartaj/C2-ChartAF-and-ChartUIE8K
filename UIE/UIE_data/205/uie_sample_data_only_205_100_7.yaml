02_initial_prompt: I'd like a box chart to visualize the distribution of 'MEDV' (median
  value of owner-occupied homes) in the Real Estate DataSet. Please use the '../Extra_datas/data/205.csv'
  data format provided. Make sure the chart shows the minimum, first quartile (25th
  percentile), median (50th percentile), third quartile (75th percentile), and maximum
  values. Highlight any outliers in the dataset. This will help me understand the
  spread and central tendency of home values within the dataset. Ensure the chart
  is properly labeled and easy to interpret. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
