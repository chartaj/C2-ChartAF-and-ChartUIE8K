  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the Real Estate dataset. On the x-axis, use 'RM'
  (average number of rooms per dwelling) and on the y-axis, use 'MEDV' (Median value
  of owner-occupied homes in $1000s). Highlight data points where 'CHAS' equals 1
  with a different color to represent properties near the Charles River. Please ensure
  missing data in 'RM' are addressed, either by removal or imputation. Include axis
  labels and a title for clarity.
