02_initial_prompt: Create a stacked column chart to visualize the Real Estate DataSet.
  Display the 'MEDV' column as the primary variable, and use a different color for
  different 'CHAS' values (0 and 1). Each column should represent a unique combination
  of 'ZN' and 'RAD' values. The height of each segment within a column should correspond
  to the average 'MEDV' for that 'CHAS' value. Label the x-axis with combinations
  of 'ZN' and 'RAD', and the y-axis with 'MEDV'. This will help compare median home
  values across different zones and accessibility ratings, highlighting the impact
  of the Charles River adjacency.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a stacked column chart to visualize the Real Estate DataSet. Display the
  ''MEDV'' column as the primary variable, and use a different color for different
  ''CHAS'' values (0 and 1). Each column should represent a unique combination of
  ''ZN'' and ''RAD'' values. The height of each segment within a column should correspond
  to the average ''MEDV'' for that ''CHAS'' value. Label the x-axis with combinations
  of ''ZN'' and ''RAD'', and the y-axis with ''MEDV''. This will help compare median
  home values across different zones and accessibility ratings, highlighting the impact
  of the Charles River adjacency.
