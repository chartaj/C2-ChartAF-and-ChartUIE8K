02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap visualizing the population growth of countries
  over the decades. Use columns 'country' and 'year' to map the population changes.
  Highlight countries with significant growth or decline. For clarity, ensure color
  gradients represent growth rates from 1970 to 2023. Also, include a legend explaining
  the colors. Provide an overall view of how populations have evolved continent-wise.
  Ensure the heatmap is granular enough to show differences at the country level but
  aggregated to continents for broader trends. This will help in analyzing global
