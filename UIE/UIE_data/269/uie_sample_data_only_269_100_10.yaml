02_initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the 2023 population distribution
  by continent using the provided dataset. Display the total population partitioned
  into respective continents (Asia, North America, etc.), enabling easy comparison
  of how the global population is spread across different regions. Use distinct colors
  for each continent and include clear labels or a legend to identify each segment.
  This will help in understanding population density and allocation across the continents.
  Make sure the chart is clean, easy to read, and accurately reflects the data provided.
