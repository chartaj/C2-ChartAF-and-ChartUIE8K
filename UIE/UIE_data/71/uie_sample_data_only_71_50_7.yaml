  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the bubble chart?

  2. Would you like to display the name of the institution on hover along with the
  URL?

  3. Do you want the bubble sizes to be proportional to the exact count of institutions,
  or would you prefer categorical sizing (e.g., small, medium, large)?

  4. Should the chart include a legend to explain bubble sizes and category colors?

  5. Do you have a specific font preference for labels and axes titles?

  6. Is there a specific layout or orientation for the chart (e.g., horizontal, vertical)
  that you prefer?

  7. Would you like any additional annotations or markers on the chart (e.g., highlighting
  top regions by count)?

  8. Are there any specific regions or categories that you want to emphasize visually?

  9. Do you prefer a specific style for the gridlines or axes (e.g., solid, dashed,
  or none)?

  10. Do you have any specific preferences for the margin sizes or aspect ratio of
