  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart visualizing the number of higher education institutions across
  different regions in the USA. Use color highlights to distinguish between the 'Private'
  and 'Public' categories. Annotate bars representing 'Texas' and 'California' with
  their respective institution names to emphasize regional distribution. Include total
  counts and unique URLs for added context. This chart will help quickly understand
  the concentration and diversity of educational institutions by region, aiding in
  geographic and institutional comparison.
