  the relationship between these different stock price columns over time? Specifically,
  I am interested in seeing how the opening, closing, high, and low prices correlate
  with each other. Could you use a color gradient to show these relationships clearly?
  This would help me understand which stock prices move together and the overall market

  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  I have a dataset of Samsung stock prices with columns like Date, Open, High, Low,
  Close, Adj Close, and Volume. Can you create a heatmap to visualize the relationship
  between these different stock price columns over time? Specifically, I am interested
  in seeing how the opening, closing, high, and low prices correlate with each other.
  Could you use a color gradient to show these relationships clearly? This would help
  me understand which stock prices move together and the overall market trend. Please
  make sure the heatmap is easy to interpret. Thank you!
