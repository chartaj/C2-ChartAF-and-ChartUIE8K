  1. I have no specific preference.

  2. I would like the text annotations to be in a medium font size, with a contrasting
  color to the background, and positioned close to the respective data points.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. Yes, including grid lines would be helpful for readability.

  5. The x-axis could be labeled "IMDb Ratings" and the y-axis "Rotten Tomatoes Scores".
  The title could be "Top-Rated TV Shows by Streaming Platform".

  6. I do not know.
