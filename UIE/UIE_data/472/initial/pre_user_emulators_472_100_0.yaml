  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a dot plot that visualizes the data for the "Country Name" from 2000 and
  2020. Differentiate the groups by color coding the dots accordingly. Highlight significant
  changes from 2000 to 2020 with annotations pointing out the increases or decreases.
  The purpose of this visualization is to compare the economic growth in East Asia
  & Pacific countries over the 20-year period. Make sure to use text annotations to
  highlight key countries like Japan, Australia, and China. Add a title and labels
  for clarity. This will help the government analyze regional economic trends and
  policy impacts.
