02_initial_prompt: Please create a Dumbbell chart that visualizes the change in values
  from the year 2000 to 2020 for different countries, grouped by their regions. The
  chart should clearly show the 2000 and 2020 values positioned at either end of the
  dumbbells, with countries on the y-axis and the years on the x-axis. Use different
  colors to highlight the grouping regions (East Asia & Pacific). This will help compare
  the growth or decline in values over 20 years for each country in distinct regional
  groups. Ensure the chart is easy to interpret for a government-focused audience.
