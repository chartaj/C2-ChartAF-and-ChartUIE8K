  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have any color preference for the choropleth map to represent

  6. Is there a preferred way for you to deal with any missing data in the visualization?

  7. Do you have a preference for the map projection (e.g., Mercator, Robinson) to
  be used for the choropleth map?

  8. Are there any specific regions or countries you would like to highlight or emphasize
  more prominently on the map?

  9. Should the map include additional contextual information such as geographical
