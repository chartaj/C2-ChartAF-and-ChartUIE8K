  Create a line chart that visualizes the construction costs of public transit-infrastructure
  projects over time in Canada. Use the ''cost'' column on the Y-axis and ''year''
  on the X-axis. Differentiate the lines by ''city'' and ''line,'' so we can compare
  trends in different locations and projects. Add markers for key data points and
