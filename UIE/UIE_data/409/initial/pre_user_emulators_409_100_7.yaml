- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n2. Shapes:\n\
  Description: Shape annotations include lines, arrows, rectangles, and other shapes.\
  \ They can highlight or enclose specific chart elements to emphasize or compare\
  \ them.\nData-Driven Use: Some shapes, like trend lines, are calculated from the\
  \ underlying data.\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Hexagonal binning that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Hexagonal binning
  that utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

- "Please create a hexagonal binning plot illustrating the mineral reserves estimates.\
  \ The x-axis should represent the 'x' values (quantitative measure), while the y-axis\
  \ should represent the 'y' values (another quantitative measure). Each hexagon should\
  \ reflect the data density, helping to understand the concentration of reserve estimates.\
  \ Additionally, use color coding to differentiate the 'group' categories (\u2018\
  A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019). Ensure the chart is labeled correctly, providing\
  \ a clear title and axis labels, and include a legend to indicate which colors correspond\
  \ to which groups. Make it visually appealing for presentation."
