2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a beeswarm chart to visualize mineral reserves estimates in the energy sector
  using this data. Include groups A, B, and C, comparing their respective reserves
  ('x' and 'y'). Add text annotations to highlight key data points that mark anomalies
  or trends, focusing on outliers. Utilize shape annotations like circles or rectangles
  to encapsulate regions of interest around clustered data points to indicate significant
  data groupings or notable divergences. Ensure the chart effectively emphasizes differences
  between the groups and makes it easier to visualize unique and critical aspects
  of the reserves estimates.
