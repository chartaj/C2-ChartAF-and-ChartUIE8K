09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. Yes, I would like to display grid lines on the chart.

  3. I am not sure about the font style and size, just make it clear and readable.

  4. I do not know, any style that makes it easy to differentiate the lines is fine.

  5. I am not sure about annotations or markers, maybe just make sure key points are
  visible.

  6. Yes, please include axis titles. Something like "Patient Index" for the x-axis
  and "Values" for the y-axis.

  7. I have no specific preference for background color or theme.

  8. I do not have any specific ranges or limits in mind for the y-axis values.

  9. I would prefer the legend to be placed at the bottom of the chart.

  10. No additional context or textual information is needed.'
