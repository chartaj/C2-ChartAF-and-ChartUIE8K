  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a scatter plot for the Heart Disease Dataset. Plot ''age'' on the x-axis
  and ''cholesterol'' on the y-axis. Use different colors to differentiate between
  the ''sex'' category (0 for female, 1 for male). Include a legend to indicate the
  sex of the individuals. Make sure to label the axes and title the chart appropriately.
  Additionally, use different markers to represent the ''target'' variable (0 for
  no disease, 1 for disease). This will help visualize the relation between age, cholesterol
