09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure about the custom range or limits for the y-axes.

  3. Markers would be fine for highlighting significant peaks or valleys.

  4. I do not know; I do not have a specific format or precision in mind.

  5. I am not sure about the gridlines or background preferences.

  6. Yes, including legends or labels would be helpful. No specific format required.

  7. Yes, please include a title like "Correlation between Temperature and Entanglement
  Level over Q-States" and a subtitle explaining the context of Quantum Decision-Making
  under different conditions.'
