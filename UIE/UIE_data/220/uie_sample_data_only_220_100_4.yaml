02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset on the distances between various Russian cities
  used for transportation and logistics planning. I'd like to visualize this data
  using a violin plot to show the distribution of distances between different pairs
  of cities. Please generate a violin plot where each city's name or unique identifier
  is on the x-axis, and the y-axis represents the distances. This will help me see
  the spread and density of distances for each city pairing. Ensure that the chart
  properly highlights any outliers or clusters in the data. Thank you!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
