  Length and Petal Length by Species. Ensure to include text annotations for some
  specific data points that highlight their values, drawing attention to notable differences
  or outliers. Use highlights to differentiate between species, making each species
  visually distinct. The chart should help viewers quickly grasp the variation in
  sepal and petal dimensions across different species of flowers. The visualization

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
