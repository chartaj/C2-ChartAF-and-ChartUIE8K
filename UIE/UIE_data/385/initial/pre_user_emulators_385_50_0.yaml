- Create a column chart displaying military expenditure by country, categorized by
  continent. Use text annotations to highlight expenditure values for the top three
  countries. Include highlights to emphasize major spending differences between continents.
  The chart should provide a comprehensive understanding of global military spending
  distribution.
