  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

- Create a candlestick chart for IBM stock data. Highlight significant volume changes.
  Annotate specific high and low prices to capture attention. Use colors to differentiate
  between rising and falling prices. Ensure the chart is intuitive for business analysis.
