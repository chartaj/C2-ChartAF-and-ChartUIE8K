  \ to specific elements by highlighting their values.\nPurpose: When only some elements\
  \ are annotated, the intent is to focus the viewer\u2019s attention on those before\
  \ examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven annotations can provide context,\
  \ orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\nDescription: Highlights\
  \ modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color) to emphasize or reduce\
  \ their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain elements from others,\
  \ making them stand out visually."

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  It MUST be a chart that can be created using only data columns.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Bar chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Bar chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a bar chart comparing the unique values in the 'LCA_Category_sub'
  column with the count of missing values in the 'Gephart Match' column. This will
  help visualize how the different subcategories of fish (captured) relate to the
  instances where 'Gephart Match' data is missing. Make sure to label each bar clearly
  with the subcategory names and indicate the count of missing values for each. Thank
  you!
