  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting countries
  from Africa?

  2. Would you like the scatter plot to include grid lines for better readability?

  3. Do you have a preference for the font style or size for the text annotations?

  4. Should the text annotations for countries with the highest and lowest life expectancies
  include additional information such as the exact values of ''Income (GDP per capita)''
  and ''Life expectancy in years''?

  5. Would you prefer a specific marker style (such as circles, squares, etc.) for
  the scatter plot points?

  6. Should the plot include a legend detailing what different colors or marker styles
  represent?

  7. Would you like to set specific axis limits for ''Income (GDP per capita)'' and
  ''Life expectancy in years'' to better visualize the data?

  8. Is there a specific order in which you would like to layer the highlighted African
  countries against other countries in the plot (e.g., in front or behind)?

  9. Are there any other specific countries or regions you would like to highlight
  in addition to African countries?
