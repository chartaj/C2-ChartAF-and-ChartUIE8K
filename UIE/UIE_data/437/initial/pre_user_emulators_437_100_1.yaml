2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a histogram to visualize the number of speeches, thoughts, narratives, and
  depictions for X-men characters from Chris Claremont comics. Add text annotations
  to highlight the top three characters in each category, focusing on their values.
  Use different colors to distinguish between each category of data. Include context
  about the characters' roles and highlight any character that appears uniquely significant
  in terms of speech, thoughts, or narrative contributions. Ensure it captures the
  distribution and comparison of these elements effectively for a clear, comprehensive
  view.
