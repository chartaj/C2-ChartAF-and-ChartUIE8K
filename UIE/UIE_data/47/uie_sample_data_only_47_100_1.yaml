02_initial_prompt: Please create a scatter plot using the March 2022 Laptop data.
  Include the "brand" and "processor_name" on the x-axis and the "latest_price" on
  the y-axis. Annotate only the top five most expensive laptops to highlight their
  prices and models. Use highlights to emphasize laptops with discounts above 20%,
  making them stand out by changing their color. The visualization should focus on
  comparing different brands and processors in relation to their prices and discounts.
  Include a title and legend for clarity.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
