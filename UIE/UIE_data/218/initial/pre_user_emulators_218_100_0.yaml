2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a stacked bar chart that visualizes the frequency of different labels ('Story',
  'Partnership', 'Award', etc.) in SAP press release headlines. Use text annotations
  to highlight the exact frequency values on top of each bar to emphasize the importance
  of particular labels. Highlight bars with fewer labels in a distinct color to draw
  attention to less common categories. This will help in understanding the distribution
  of topics in business-related press releases by SAP. Ensure the chart is visually
  appealing to effectively communicate insights at a glance for business stakeholders.
