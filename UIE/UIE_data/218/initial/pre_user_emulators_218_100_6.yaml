  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Treemap that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Treemap that utilizes
  all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a treemap visualization using the given data on SAP press releases. The treemap
  should show the distribution of headlines across different labels such as 'Story,'
  'Partnership,' and 'Award.' Each section of the treemap should represent a different
  label, with the size of the section corresponding to the number of headlines under
  that label. The purpose is to understand the focus areas in SAP's press releases.
  Ensure the chart is easy to read and interpret, highlighting key categories. Use
  color coding to differentiate between the various labels.
