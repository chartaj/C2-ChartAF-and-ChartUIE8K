  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the colors. Maybe you can choose what''s visually
  clear.

  2. I do not know, any standard markers you think are appropriate.

  3. Yes, I would like to include major gridlines.

  4. Just the basic axis labels: "CGPA" for the x-axis and "Placed or Not" for the
  y-axis.

  5. Yes, a title would be good. Something like "Scatter Plot of CGPA vs. Placement
  Status".

  6. I am not sure about the font style or size, standard readable fonts should be
  fine.

  7. I have no specific preference about the legend''s location, maybe top-right.

  8. No, I do not require any additional annotations or information on the chart.'
