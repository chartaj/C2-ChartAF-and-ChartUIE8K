- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Tile map that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Tile map that utilizes
  all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a tile map visualizing the probability of rain across various regions
  shown by codes in the dataset. Each tile should represent a different region and
  be color-coded based on the 'prob' value, with a gradient from low (light color)
  to high (dark color) probabilities. The region codes like 'ME', 'RI', and 'VT' should
  be labeled on each tile. The map should highlight the geographical distribution
  of rain probability to easily interpret areas with higher and lower chances of rain.
  Make sure to include a legend and title to the map for clarity. Thank you!
