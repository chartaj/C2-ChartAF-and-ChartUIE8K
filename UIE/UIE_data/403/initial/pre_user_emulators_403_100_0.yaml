  Visualize the probability of rain for different states using a choropleth map. Highlight
  states with the highest and lowest probabilities with distinct colors. Annotate
  selected states like ME, RI, and VT with their probabilities to draw attention and
  help viewers quickly identify key information. Ensure no data points are missing
  and double-check unique codes for accuracy. Aim to make the map easy to understand
  while clearly showing variability in rain probability across regions.
