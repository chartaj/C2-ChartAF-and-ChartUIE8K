- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Pie chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Pie chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a pie chart using the data provided in the file location '../Extra_datas/data/403.csv'.
  The chart should visualize the probability of rain by different states. Each slice
  of the pie chart should represent a state, labeled by the 'code' column, and the
  size of each slice should be determined by the corresponding 'prob' value. The chart
  should clearly show which states are more likely to experience rain based on the
  given probabilities. Ensure the chart is color-coded and has a legend for easier
  interpretation. The data is related to weather and emphasizes probabilities.
