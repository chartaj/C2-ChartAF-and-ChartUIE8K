  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating language
  families and regions?

  2. Would you like specific legends or labels for the regions and families?

  3. How detailed should the ISO Codes be displayed within the treemap (e.g., always
  visible, hover tooltip)?

  4. Should the size of each treemap section strictly correspond to the number of
  speakers?

  5. Do you want a specific way to highlight the speaker count (e.g., color intensity,
  annotations)?

  6. Are there any specific regions or language families you want to emphasize or
  visually distinguish more?

  7. Would you like borderlines between different language families or regions to
  be more prominent?

  8. Should the treemap include a title and/or subtitle? If so, what should it be?

  9. Do you prefer any specific font style or size for the labels and text within
