  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\

  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n   \n3.\
  \ Highlights:\nDescription: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g.,\
  \ size, color) to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish\
  \ certain elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation\

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Line chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Line chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a line chart visualizing the trends of child labor in urban Britain
  and UK boys over time. Use the provided data from 1851 to 1871. The x-axis should
  show the years and the y-axis should represent the percentage of child labor. Include
  separate lines for "Child Labor in Urban Britain" and "Child Labor UK boys, historic"
  to compare the two trends effectively. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to understand,
  highlighting the severity and patterns in child labor during this historical period.
  Thank you!
