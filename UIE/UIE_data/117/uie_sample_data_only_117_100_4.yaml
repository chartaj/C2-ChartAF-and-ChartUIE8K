02_initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the "Apple Quality" data with a box chart.
  The chart should display the distribution of Size, Weight, Sweetness, Crunchiness,
  Juiciness, and Ripeness. We need boxes for each attribute, showing their ranges
  and central tendencies. The x-axis would represent the attributes, and the y-axis
  would represent their values. Ensure to highlight outliers and specify the corresponding
  apple quality, distinguishing between 'good' and 'bad' apples where possible. This
  can help in identifying which attributes impact the perceived quality of apples.
