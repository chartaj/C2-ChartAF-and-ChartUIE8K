09_answers: '1. I don''t have any specific color preferences for the product categories.

  2. I am not sure about the font size and style.

  3. I do not know about grid lines; you can decide what looks best.

  4. Full dates would be better for clarity, like "January 1, 2024".

  5. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  6. I don''t have a preference for the legend position.

  7. I am not sure about the margin or padding settings.

  8. No, I am looking for an image, not an interactive visualization, so tooltips
  aren''t necessary.

  9. Including currency symbols with revenue values would be nice.

  10. I do not have any specific annotations or reference lines in mind.'
