02_initial_prompt: I want a stacked column chart that shows the number of languages
  spoken in different world regions of New York City. For each region, stack the columns
  by the Language Families present in that region. Use "World Region" for the x-axis
  and the count of "Language Family" for the y-axis. Each stack segment should represent
  a different language family. Make sure the chart is labeled with the total number
  of languages spoken in each region. This will help visualize the diversity of languages
  and their families across different regions in NYC.
