  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size for the annotations.

  4. I would like the percentage change values to be displayed above the bars.

  5. I do not have a specific title in mind.

  6. I have no specific preference for additional information in the axis labels.

  7. I am not sure about the specific angle for tilting the x-axis labels, but just
  enough to prevent overlap.
