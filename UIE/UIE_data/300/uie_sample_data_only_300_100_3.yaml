09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, as long as it''s clear.

  2. I do not know, maybe you can decide what looks best.

  3. Circles would be fine for missing data points.

  4. I have no specific preference for the font style or size.

  5. Yes, please include a legend. I am not sure where it should be placed; you can
  choose the best place.

  6. Yes, include gridlines in both directions for easier reading.

  7. I do not know about annotations; you can add if you think it''s necessary.

  8. I have no specific preference for the y-axis scaling.
