  I''d like to visualize the trading volume of Cardano over time. Could you create

  I''m particularly interested in seeing the distribution and frequency of high trading
  volume days, so make sure the bins are appropriately spaced to highlight any peaks
  in trading activity. This will help me understand the trading patterns and identify
  any significant spikes in volume. Thanks!'

  Hi there,


  I''d like to visualize the trading volume of Cardano over time. Could you create
  a histogram using the ''Volume'' data from the CSV file I provided? Please plot
  the trading volume along the Y-axis and the corresponding dates along the X-axis.
  I''m particularly interested in seeing the distribution and frequency of high trading
  volume days, so make sure the bins are appropriately spaced to highlight any peaks
  in trading activity. This will help me understand the trading patterns and identify
  any significant spikes in volume. Thanks!
