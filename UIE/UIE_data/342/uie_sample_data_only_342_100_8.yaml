  Use the data from the CSV file to plot 'Date' on the x-axis and 'Close' on the y-axis.
  Each point should represent a day's closing price. Ensure the x-axis dates are clearly
  labeled and readable. Add a title "Cardano Daily Close Prices" to the chart, and
  label the axes appropriately. Highlight any significant trends or anomalies you
  observe. The chart should give a clear understanding of Cardano's market behavior
