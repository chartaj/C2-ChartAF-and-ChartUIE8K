  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme of the box chart?

  2. Should the box chart show individual data points in addition to the boxplot summary
  statistics (e.g., using a strip plot or a swarm plot)?

  3. Do you want to include labels for outliers in the chart?

  4. Do you prefer to display the medians inside the boxes, or would you rather have
  a separate legend for central tendency markers?

  5. Would you like the chart to include annotations or textual descriptions explaining
  specific data points or trends?

  6. Should the x-axis or y-axis have a log scale, or will a linear scale suffice?

  7. Do you want to add grid lines to the background for easier reading of values?

  8. Do you have a preferred orientation for the box chart (vertical or horizontal)?

  9. Do you need each team to be represented in a specific order, or is an alphabetical
  order acceptable?

  10. Would you like to include additional visuals, like mean or median lines, to
  emphasize central tendency across teams?'
