09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific color preferences.

  2. I am not sure, maybe a distinct color like red or blue for the USA.

  3. I do not know, just something clear and readable.

  4. The subtitle could include the date when the data was retrieved and the source
  of the data.

  5. I prefer vertical bars.'
