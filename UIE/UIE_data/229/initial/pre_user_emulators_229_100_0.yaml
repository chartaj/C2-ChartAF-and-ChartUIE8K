- 'Create a pie chart to visualize global Covid data. Highlight countries with the
  most cases and deaths. Add text annotations for "Total Cases," "Total Deaths," and
  "Total Recovered" for the top three countries: USA, India, and France. This helps
  focus on specific countries'' stats. Use different colors for each segment to distinguish
  the data effectively. The aim is to provide a clear visual representation to understand
  the global impact of Covid-19, emphasizing where the highest cases and death rates
  are concentrated. This visual aid is crucial for quick, data-driven insights and
  comparisons.'
