09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. Labels would be best.

  4. I do not know.

  5. Including city names would be helpful.

  6. I would prefer around 5 distinct color ranges.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, please include numeric labels for median housing values.

  9. A gradient would be better for visualizing the variations.
