2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize a scatter plot depicting corn price trends for agriculture and farming.
  The x-axis should represent the date, while the y-axis should show the price. Highlight
  key dates where significant price changes occur by modifying their appearance, such
  as increasing point size or changing color. Include annotations for these highlighted
  points to display exact price values, drawing attention to them before examining
  other data points. This will emphasize important price changes and provide context
  for market behavior. Use non-data-driven annotations for additional context or commentary,
  if necessary, to enhance understanding.
