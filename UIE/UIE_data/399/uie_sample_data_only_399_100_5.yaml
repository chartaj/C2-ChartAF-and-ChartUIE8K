  The chart should use the 'price' column from the dataset to show the variability
  in corn prices, highlighting any outliers and the overall price range. Please ensure
  the x-axis represents the dates, and the y-axis represents the price values. This
  visualization will help us understand the historical price trends and identify any
  unusual price fluctuations in the agriculture and farming sector for corn.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
