02_initial_prompt: Creating a parallel coordinates chart to visualize Stand abilities
  from Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is helpful. Plot the attributes (PWR, SPD, RNG, PER,
  PRC, DEV) on parallel axes. Each line represents a Stand, showing its performance
  across these attributes. Focus on differentiating strong and weak Stands using distinctive
  colors for clarity. Highlight missing values in the dataset. Generate a chart that
  makes it easy to compare Stand abilities side-by-side, providing insights into similarities
  and differences. This visualization will aid in understanding diverse Stand capabilities
  effectively.

  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.
