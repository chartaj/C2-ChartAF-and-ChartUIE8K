2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a visual representation of the German Bundestag's composition with a pie
  chart. Use the data to show the distribution of parliamentary seats (MdBs) among
  different political parties. Highlight "SPD" and "The Greens" to make them stand
  out, and include annotations for these parties to give more context, such as their
  exact seat numbers. The chart should help viewers easily grasp the parliamentary
  makeup and identify key parties.
