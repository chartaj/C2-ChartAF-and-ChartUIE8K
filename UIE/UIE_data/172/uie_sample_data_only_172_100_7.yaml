02_initial_prompt: I need a histogram for the "Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024" dataset.
  The x-axis should represent "Spotify Popularity" and the y-axis should represent
  the "Frequency" of tracks having that popularity score. Please use different colors
  to indicate varying popularities. If there's any missing popularity values, handle
  them appropriately. Include a legend. Make sure the bins are properly sized to clearly
  show the distribution. Additionally, it would be helpful to have titles and labels
  for clarity. This will help visualize how popularity scores are distributed among
  the top-streamed songs of 2024. Thank you!
