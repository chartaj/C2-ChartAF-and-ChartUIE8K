  Create a line chart visualizing the trends of the last year the plants were seen
  (year_last_seen) for different binomial names. Use the column ''year_last_seen''
  for the x-axis and the ''binomial_name'' for the y-axis. The chart should highlight
  the different continents to provide geographical context. Ensure each data point
  specifies the ''red_list_category'' to indicate the conservation status of each
  plant. Color-code the lines based on the group of the plants (''Flowering Plant'',
