09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific color gradients to use.

  2. I do not have any preferred color schemes for highlighting endangered or extinct

  3. The text annotations for key species should be in a readable font size and maybe
  in a contrasting color against the heatmap for clarity, but I am not sure about
  the specifics.

  4. I do not know how the heatmap should be sorted.

  5. I am not sure about the legend formatting.

  6. I have no specific labeling preferences for the axes.
