02_initial_prompt: I have data about influencers in the Tech and Music groups. I want
  a network graph where nodes represent influencers and edges represent connections
  between them. The node size should reflect the number of followers, and different
  colors for group differentiation. The relationships are via followers count and
  groups. Make sure missing values are handled properly. This is for visualizing an
  influencer network in the media and communications field. Example influencers are
  Alice from Tech with 1M followers and Charlie from Music with 2M followers.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for differentiating the groups
  (Tech and Music)?

  2. How would you like to handle missing values in the data (e.g., imputation, removal)?

  3. Do you have specific size ranges in mind for the nodes representing the number
  of followers?

  4. Are there any specific layout algorithms you prefer for the network graph (e.g.,
  force-directed, circular)?

  5. Do you have any specific label display preferences for the influencer nodes (e.g.,
  showing names, follower counts)?

  6. Would you like to include a legend to identify group colors and follower size
  significance?

  7. Should we include any filtering options, such as showing only influencers with
  a certain minimum number of followers?

  8. Are there specific design styles or themes you prefer for the overall aesthetic
  of the network graph?'
