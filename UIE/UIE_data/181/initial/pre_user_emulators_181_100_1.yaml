2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a scatter plot to visualize Taylor Swift's tour data, focusing on
  attendance and revenue across different cities and venues. Highlight sold-out shows
  for emphasis. Add text annotations for notable attendance or revenue figures to
  draw attention. The chart should tell a story of Taylor's concert impact, showing
  which cities had the highest attendance and revenue. The purpose is to analyze the
  success of her Fearless Tour, with a practical view of market differences and fanbase
  strength across locations. Ensure it is engaging with relevant annotations and highlights
  for clarity.
