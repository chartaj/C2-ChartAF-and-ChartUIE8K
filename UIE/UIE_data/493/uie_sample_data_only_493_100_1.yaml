09_answers: '1. I do not have specific preferences for the colors used to highlight
  the key data points.

  2. I am not sure about the style of line; maybe a solid line would work.

  3. I have no specific preference for symbols to highlight key data points.

  4. I do not know about the font style and size for the text annotations.

  5. A grid for better readability would be good, but I am not sure which style.

  6. I do not have preferred locations for non-data-driven annotations.

  7. Maybe highlight around 3 to 5 critical points on the chart.

  8. A title and subtitle would be nice, but I do not have specific ones in mind.

  9. Axis labels would be helpful. Maybe "X-Axis" for the x-axis and "Y-Axis" for
  the y-axis.

  10. I do not have any specific ranges or intervals in mind to emphasize or annotate.'
