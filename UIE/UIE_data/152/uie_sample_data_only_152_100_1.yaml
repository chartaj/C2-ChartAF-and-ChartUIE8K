02_initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot using the Body Fat Prediction Dataset to
  visualize the relationship between BodyFat and Weight. Highlight data points with
  BodyFat less than 10% and greater than 30% in different colors. Add text annotations
  for the highlighted points to display their specific values. This will help identify
  individuals with exceptionally low or high body fat percentages, which can have
  significant health implications. The scatter plot should also include age as a color

  different age groups.
