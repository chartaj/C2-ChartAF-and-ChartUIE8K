02_initial_prompt: I'd like to see a box plot visualizing the distribution of body
  fat percentage across different age groups from the Body Fat Prediction Dataset.
  Please divide the age groups into appropriate ranges (like 20-30, 30-40, etc.) and
  plot the body fat percentages for each range on the y-axis. Use the x-axis to represent
  the different age groups. Include whiskers to show the variability outside the upper
  and lower quartiles, and ideally, highlight any outliers. This would help in understanding
  how body fat distribution varies with age.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
