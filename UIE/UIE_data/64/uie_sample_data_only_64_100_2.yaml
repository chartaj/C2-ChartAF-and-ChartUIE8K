02_initial_prompt: I want a box chart visualizing Apple's stock prices over time.
  The chart should have boxes for key statistics like the Open, High, Low, and Close
  prices, along with Volume. Use text annotations to highlight specific dates with
  notable price changes, emphasizing any outliers or significant trading volumes.
  Additionally, include highlights to make the key statistics stand out, perhaps by
  using different colors or sizes for more critical elements. Make sure the chart
  clearly shows trends and extreme values to provide a comprehensive view of Apple's
  stock performance for business analysis.
