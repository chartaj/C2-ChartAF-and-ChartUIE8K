2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a box chart visualizing Apple's stock prices over time. The chart should
  have boxes for key statistics like the Open, High, Low, and Close prices, along
  with Volume. Use text annotations to highlight specific dates with notable price
  changes, emphasizing any outliers or significant trading volumes. Additionally,
  include highlights to make the key statistics stand out, perhaps by using different
  colors or sizes for more critical elements. Make sure the chart clearly shows trends
  and extreme values to provide a comprehensive view of Apple's stock performance
  for business analysis.
