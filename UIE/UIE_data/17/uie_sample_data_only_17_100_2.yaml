02_initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart to visualize book data from Goodreads.
  Specifically, I want to see the distribution of average ratings across different
  authors. The chart should have authors on the x-axis and their books' average ratings
  on the y-axis. Use different colors for each rating category to highlight differences.
  Include annotations to emphasize authors with the highest and lowest average ratings.
  The visualization should help in quickly identifying which authors have the most
  consistently high-rated books. This will be used for a study in arts and entertainment.
