02_initial_prompt: Create a box chart visualizing the distribution of average ratings
  for books from different publishers. Use the provided book data, highlighting the
  top-rated books. Add shapes to emphasize clustering of ratings for top publishers
  like 'Scholastic Inc.' and outliers. The chart should help identify patterns in
  ratings by publisher to understand market performance. This visualization will be
  useful for publishers and readers in the arts and entertainment category, particularly
  for those interested in Goodreads book reviews. Be sure to make the box chart easily
  readable and visually appealing.
