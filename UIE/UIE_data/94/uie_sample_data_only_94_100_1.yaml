02_initial_prompt: Please create a pie chart visualizing the global population distribution
  in 2024, highlighting the age demographics. Annotate specific slices with the median
  age and fertility rate to draw attention to key data points. This visualization
  will emphasize variations in age distribution and fertility rates across different
  sectors of the population. Additionally, provide context on the yearly percentage
  changes and density over the years, as this will help understand population growth
  trends over the past century. Ensure the chart is visually engaging and easy to
  interpret by using distinctive colors and labels.

09_answers: '1. I do not know, I have no specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure, I would appreciate your recommendation.

  3. Inside the slices would be great for the median age and fertility rate annotations.

  4. Yes, a legend would be helpful. It should be detailed enough to explain the different
  age demographics.

  5. I am not sure, I have no specific preference for font or style.

  6. I am not sure how this should be presented; please recommend what would work
  best.

  7. I do not know, I have no specific preference for the size or dimensions.
