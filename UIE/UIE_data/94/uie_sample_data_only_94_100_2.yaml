02_initial_prompt: Create an area chart visualizing global population growth from
  1955 to 2024. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight key data points for
  years 1955, 1980, 2000, and 2024, showing population figures and yearly percentage
  changes. Apply highlights to emphasize significant changes in population density
  and median age over the years. Ensure the chart gives viewers a clear understanding
  of population trends, fertility rates, and demographic shifts such as median age.
  The chart should visually convey the magnitude of population growth and its implications
  on global density and social-economic factors.
