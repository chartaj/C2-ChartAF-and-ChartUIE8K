- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a column chart that visualizes the global population data from 1955
  to 2024 as provided in the dataset. I want the x-axis to represent the years and
  the y-axis to show the population in billions. Make sure to display the yearly population
  changes and the yearly percentage change. Include the number of people in millions
  on the y-axis, and present the trend clearly to visualize the population growth
  over these years. Please color-code the yearly changes and percentage changes for
  better clarity. Thanks!
