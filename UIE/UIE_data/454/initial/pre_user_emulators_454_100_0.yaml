- I need a grouped bar chart visualizing the Desktop Windows version market share
  over the years 2015 to 2019. Focus on highlighting the most significant changes
  in market share for each Windows version. Use text annotations to display specific
  values of major declines or increases in market share, such as the drop in WinXP
  or the trend for Win7. Ensure different colors are used to differentiate each Windows
  version clearly. This visualization will help in understanding how the market shares
  for different Windows versions have evolved over the years.
