02_initial_prompt: Create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of different
  regions in the Medical Cost Personal Datasets. The donut chart should segment the
  regions ('northwest', 'northeast', 'southeast', 'southwest') based on the count
  of occurrences in the dataset. Highlight each segment with a different color to
  distinguish between the regions clearly. Include labels with the percentage of each
  region for better insight. Ensure the chart is visually appealing and easy to understand
  for quick data interpretation regarding regional distribution in medical cost data.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.
