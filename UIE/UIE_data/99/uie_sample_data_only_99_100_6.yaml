02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between various metrics
  like Suscribers, Visits, Likes, and Comments for the top 1000 YouTube channels.
  Use colors to indicate the intensity of the correlation. For instance, strong positive
  correlations should be in bold colors and weak or negative correlations in lighter
  shades. Make sure to label the axes clearly with the metrics and include a legend
  to explain the color coding. Display countries on the y-axis and metrics on the
  x-axis to explore regional trends. This will help identify patterns and insights
  in YouTube channel performance.
