  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting the correlation
  strengths in the heatmap?

  2. Would you like the color intensity to follow a specific gradient (e.g., from
  blue to red, or from light to dark)?

  3. Do you prefer any specific labeling format for the axes or the cells in the heatmap?

  4. Should the heatmap include numerical correlation values in each cell?

  5. Are there any particular annotations or markers you would like to add to the
  heatmap to emphasize certain correlations?

  6. Do you have preferences regarding the layout or orientation of the heatmap (e.g.,
  square vs. rectangular)?

  7. Should there be any specific ranges or thresholds for the color intensities to
  denote particular strengths of correlation?

  8. Would you like grid lines or separators between cells in the heatmap for visual
  clarity?

  9. Do you need a legend or key to explain the color intensities used in the heatmap?'
