2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart showing the frequency of different fruits using the blueberry
  and blueberry.1 columns. Highlight the bars for 'blueberry' to emphasize them with
  a brighter color. Add a rectangle to enclose the 'lime' bars in both columns for
  comparison purposes. This visualization helps compare the occurrences of each fruit,
  emphasizing the 'blueberry' fruit's frequency, and draws attention to 'lime' across
  both columns using colored highlights and shapes. This will help us understand the
  distribution and emphasize the importance of certain fruits in our dataset.
