  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Column chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Column chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I have a dataset about fruit colors in food-and-drink category with two columns,
  one named "blueberry" and the other "blueberry.1." Both columns have 5 unique values
  without any missing data. Please create a column chart that shows the frequency
  of each unique value across both columns. The x-axis should represent each unique
  fruit listed (apple, blueberry, and lime), and the y-axis should represent their
  frequency count. Use different colors for each column in the chart to differentiate
  between "blueberry" and "blueberry.1." This will help visualize the distribution
  of fruit colors effectively.
