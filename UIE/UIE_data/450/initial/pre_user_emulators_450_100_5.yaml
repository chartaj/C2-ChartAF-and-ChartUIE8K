  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Donut chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Donut chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a donut chart visualizing the distribution of various fruits. The dataset
  includes columns for 'blueberry' and 'blueberry.1' with values such as 'apple',
  'blueberry', and 'lime'. Each fruit type should be represented by its own segment
  in the donut chart. The data does not contain any missing values and is of categorical
  type. Ensure each unique fruit type from both columns is clearly labeled and visually
  distinguishable within the chart. This will help in understanding the prevalence
  of each fruit type in the dataset. The details pertain to fruit color in the food-and-drink
  category.
