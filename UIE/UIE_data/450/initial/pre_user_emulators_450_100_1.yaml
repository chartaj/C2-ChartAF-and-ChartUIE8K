2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a histogram to compare the frequency of different fruits mentioned in the
  'fruit' and 'fruit.1' columns. Use colors for each bar to indicate different fruits.
  Highlight the bars for 'blueberry' to emphasize its occurrence. Include trend lines
  or shapes to show any significant differences between the two columns. The visualization
  aims to compare the popularity of fruits. Make the chart visually engaging to easily
  differentiate and understand the distribution of each fruit across the two categories.
  Keep it clear for those interested in food-and-drink trends.
