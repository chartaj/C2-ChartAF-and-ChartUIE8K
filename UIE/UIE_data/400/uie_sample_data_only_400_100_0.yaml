  Dorothy, Helen, Linda, and Patricia from 1880 to 1882 using a histogram. Highlight
  peaks in naming trends and annotate significant data points, especially years with
  highest counts. The purpose is to analyze naming patterns over time, focusing attention
  on fluctuating popularity. Highlight the names with different colors for easy comparison.
  Annotations should describe the significance of peak years. Such visualization can
  provide insights into historical social trends related to baby naming. Aim for a
  clear, visually distinct representation to aid quick interpretation.
