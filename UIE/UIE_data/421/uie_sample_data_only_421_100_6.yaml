02_initial_prompt: I have Nobel prize data from a CSV file. I want to create a histogram
  to visualize the gender distribution among Nobel laureates over the years. The x-axis
  should represent different decades starting from 1901. The y-axis should show the
  count of laureates. The columns to consider are 'prize_year', 'gender', and 'laureate_id'.
  Since my focus is on the male dominance topic, please differentiate between male
  and female laureates in the histogram, perhaps using different colors or labels.
  This will help in understanding the trend of gender distribution over time.
