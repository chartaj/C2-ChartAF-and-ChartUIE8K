02_initial_prompt: Create a choropleth map visualizing the birth countries of Nobel
  Prize laureates from 1901. Use different shades to represent the number of laureates
  born in each country. Highlight countries with high laureate counts for emphasis.
  Include text annotations for select countries to display exact numbers. This will
  support analyzing patterns of Nobel Prize distribution by geography, focusing on
  male dominance as the dataset mostly mentions men. Ensure the visualization effectively
  communicates where Nobel laureates are predominantly born, aligning with social-science
  studies on gender distribution and geographic origins.
