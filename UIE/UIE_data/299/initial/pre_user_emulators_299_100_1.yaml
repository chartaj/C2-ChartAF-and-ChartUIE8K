  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a heatmap visualizing the distribution of Electric Vehicles (EVs), both BEVs
  and PHEVs, across counties in Washington State as of February 29, 2020. Use color
  intensity to indicate the total count of EVs in each county, highlighting counties
  with higher counts. Include annotations for counties with the highest and lowest
  percentages of EVs, focusing attention on these key data points. The purpose is
  to visually represent the spread and adoption rate of EVs across different regions
  for easy comparison and analysis. The chart should be informative for stakeholders
  interested in the electric vehicle market.
