- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Histogram that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Histogram that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I'd like to visualize electric vehicle population data across different counties
  in the state. Can you create a histogram that shows the count of electric vehicles
  (both BEVs and PHEVs) in each county? I want to see how the penetration of electric
  vehicles varies by county. Please make sure each bar represents a different county
  and the height of the bar reflects the total number of electric vehicles (EV Total).
  The x-axis should list the counties and the y-axis should represent the number of
  electric vehicles. The chart title should be "Electric Vehicle Distribution Across
  Counties".
