  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the line chart?

  2. Do you want each county to be represented by different colors or different line
  styles?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines?

  4. How many counties would you prefer to display simultaneously if the chart gets
  crowded?

  5. Should the x-axis display specific date intervals (e.g., months, quarters, years)?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the y-axis scale (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  7. Would you like to include labels or annotations for highlighting significant
  trends or events?

  8. How would you prefer to handle missing data, if any? Should we interpolate, show
  gaps, or exclude?

  9. Should there be a legend explaining the different lines/colors/styles used in
  the chart?

  10. Would you like to display the total counts as well as proportions of BEVs and
  PHEVs?'
