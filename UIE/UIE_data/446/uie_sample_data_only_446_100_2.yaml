  I need a grouped bar chart to visualize the number of animal rescues by borough
  and year. The x-axis should show different boroughs, and the y-axis should display
  the number of incidents. Each bar group should represent a different year (cal_year).
  Add text annotations on bars that have the highest and lowest rescue counts to highlight
  significant data points. This will help in understanding the distribution of animal
  rescues across boroughs and changes over years. Use vibrant colors to distinguish
  between different years.
