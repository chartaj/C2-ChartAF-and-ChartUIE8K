  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure; use a color palette that distinctively separates the
  days.

  2. I do not know; maybe something straightforward like "Tipping Behavior Analysis
  Based on Total Bill and Day".

  3. Label the x-axis as "Total Bill ($)" and the y-axis as "Tip ($)".

  4. I have no specific preference for fonts or sizes.

  5. I am not sure; do whatever you think is best.

  6. Please place the legend outside the main plot area, maybe to the right.

  7. I do not know; standard gridlines and background should be fine.

  8. I have no specific preference for this.

  9. I am not sure about this.

  10. I do not know; use the aspect ratio that best fits the data.'
