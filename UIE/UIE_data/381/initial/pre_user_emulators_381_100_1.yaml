2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a dot plot visualizing the IQ distribution across three countries. The x-axis
  should represent the different countries, and the y-axis should show the IQ scores.
  Highlight specific data points to emphasize notable IQ values. Use text annotations
  to display the exact IQ scores for the highlighted points. The visualization aims
  to provide insight into how IQ is distributed among the countries, focusing attention
  on certain data points to aid in comparative analysis. Ensure the plot is easy to
  understand for social science research purposes.
