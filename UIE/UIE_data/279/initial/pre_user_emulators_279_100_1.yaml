  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a dot plot to visualize the relationship between primate milk composition
  and brain size, focusing on neocortex percentage. Highlight species with notable
  data points in terms of kcal per g, percentage of fat, protein, and lactose. Annotate
  these key data points to emphasize interesting patterns or outliers. Use different
  colors to distinguish between clades. Ensure to include a legend explaining color
  coding and descriptions to provide context for the data on primate biology, emphasizing
  how milk composition correlates with brain size. This will help in understanding
  primate evolutionary traits related to diet and cognition.
