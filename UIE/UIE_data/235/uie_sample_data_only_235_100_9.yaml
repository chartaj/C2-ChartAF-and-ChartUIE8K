02_initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the impact of age, BMI, and smoking status
  on medical insurance charges. Can you create a bubble chart where the x-axis represents
  age, the y-axis represents BMI, and the size of the bubbles represents the insurance
  charges? Additionally, could you color-code the bubbles by smoking status (e.g.,
  'yes' for smoker and 'no' for non-smoker)? This will help in understanding the correlation
  between these factors and the cost. Ensure the chart is clear and easy to interpret,
  highlighting any significant trends. Thank you!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
