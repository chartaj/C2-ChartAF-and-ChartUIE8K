  transportation costs over time for different travel destinations using the given
  travel dataset. Highlight key data points where costs significantly change, and
  add text annotations for those points. The chart should help travelers and trip
  planners quickly understand cost patterns in different destinations and make informed
  decisions. Additionally, use annotations to provide context or comments about the
  data, such as peak travel times or special events influencing costs. This visualization
