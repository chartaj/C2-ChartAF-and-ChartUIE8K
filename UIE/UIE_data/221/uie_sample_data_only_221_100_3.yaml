02_initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart visualization for the Traveler Trip Dataset.
  The chart should display the average accommodation cost by traveler nationality.
  Each bar should represent a different nationality with the height of the bar corresponding
  to the average accommodation cost. This will help us compare how much travelers
  from different nationalities spend on accommodations during their trips. Ensure
  the chart clearly labels each nationality and includes the cost values for better
  interpretation.
