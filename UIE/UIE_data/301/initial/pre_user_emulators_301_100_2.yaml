2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a scatter plot showing the changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels over
  time. Use the "Decimal Date" on the X-axis and "Carbon Dioxide (ppm)" on the Y-axis.
  Highlight key points with missing values and provide text annotations for the highest
  and lowest CO2 levels. This visualization will help understand trends and anomalies
  in atmospheric CO2 levels, which is crucial for environmental science. Make sure
  to include a legend and a title for clarity. The chart should be easy to understand
  for both experts and non-experts.
