07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for emphasizing the Seasonally
  Adjusted CO2 values?

  2. Would you like the text annotations for significant data points to be placed
  in any specific locations relative to the points?

  3. How would you like missing values to be noted on the chart (e.g., gaps, markers,
  or text)?

  4. Is there a specific line style (e.g., dashed, dotted) you prefer for the Seasonally
  Adjusted CO2 values?

  5. Are there any additional labels or titles you would like included on the axes
  or chart?

  6. Would you like a legend to differentiate between the Carbon Dioxide (ppm) and
  Seasonally Adjusted CO2 (ppm) lines?

  7. Do you have any preferences for the scale of the y-axis (e.g., linear, logarithmic)?

  8. Are there any specific significant data points or dates that you want to ensure
  are highlighted with annotations?

  9. Should the chart include gridlines for better readability and, if so, do you
  prefer them to be major, minor, or both?

  10. Would you like the chart to include a highlighted reference line for specific
  CO2 concentration thresholds?'
