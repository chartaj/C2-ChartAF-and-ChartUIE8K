  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a dot plot to visualize the "Weighting" of different "Species" of "Finfish."
  Highlight values with a distinctive color to emphasize species with higher "Weighting."
  Include text annotations specifically for the species "Anchovy," "Pollock," and
  "Tuna," detailing their respective "Capture" values. The purpose is to easily identify
  and compare the weighting across species, focusing initially on these three species
  before examining others. This will help in the study of fish species' ecological
  impact and their capture volumes. Keep annotations and highlights concise for readability.
