2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please visualize the "price" data using a histogram to show the distribution of
  purchase prices in the business dataset. Use data-driven text annotations to highlight
  specific data points that represent the highest and lowest prices. Additionally,
  use highlights to emphasize the most frequent price range. This will help in quickly
  identifying price trends and outliers within the dataset. Given the business context,
  this visualization will be useful for understanding the pricing structure and potential
  pricing strategy adjustment.
