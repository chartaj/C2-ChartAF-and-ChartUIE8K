- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a candlestick chart for Microsoft stocks using the provided data.
  Highlight significant dates and values to emphasize trends over time. Annotate key
  data points to showcase notable price changes, such as major highs, lows, or closing
  prices. This will help identify important patterns and assist in making informed
  investment decisions. Ensure the chart is visually clear and highlights relevant
  stock performance metrics, including open, high, low, and close prices. Use annotations
  to draw attention to significant volume changes, aiding in comprehensive market
  analysis.
