  Create a heatmap visualizing the hydrophobicity of proteins from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
  Use the ''ID'' on the y-axis and ''Hydrophobicity'' values on the x-axis. Different
  colors should indicate the degree of hydrophobicity, with a gradient ranging from
  high (blue) to low (red). The heatmap should help in quickly identifying patterns
  or outliers in protein hydrophobicity levels. Include legends and axis labels for
  clarity.
