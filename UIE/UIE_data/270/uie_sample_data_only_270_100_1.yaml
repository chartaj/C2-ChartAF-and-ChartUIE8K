02_initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the daily bicycle crossings
  over four East River bridges in New York City. Use the Brooklyn, Manhattan, Williamsburg,
  and Queensboro bridge data. Make sure the bars represent the number of crossings
  for each bridge on different dates. Highlight the days with the highest and lowest
  temperatures. Include text annotations to show exact crossing numbers for these
  highlighted days. This will help urban planners understand bicycle traffic patterns
  and potentially correlate them with weather conditions. Use color to distinguish
  between different bridges.
