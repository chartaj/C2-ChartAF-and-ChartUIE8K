2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart to represent the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Use Temperature(K)
  and Pressure(Liquid) from the first dataset for the main plot. Ensure that the bars
  are differentiated by unique colors to represent different Temperature(K) values.
  Add text annotations for the highest and lowest Pressure(Liquid) values to highlight
  these key data points. The chart should help viewers quickly understand fluctuations
  in pressure corresponding to temperature changes and highlight standout points.
