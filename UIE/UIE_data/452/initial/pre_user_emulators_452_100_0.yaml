- 'Create a scatter plot to visualize relationships in the Dow Jones Industrial Average
  data. On the X-axis, use ''Temperature(K)'' and ''Temperature(K).1'', and on the
  Y-axis, ''Pressure(Liquid)'' and ''Pressure(Gas)''. Highlight points where there''s
  a significant variation in pressure. Include text annotations for notable data points
  to emphasize key temperatures and pressures. Purpose: Understand correlations and
  patterns, focusing on outliers or unique points in the dataset. The use of text
  annotations will help in identifying specific data trends and anomalies. Suitable
  for business analysis and decision-making contexts.'
