2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a line chart using the data from the provided CSV file. Focus on plotting
  'x' against 'y'. Include text annotations to highlight significant data points,
  such as the minimum, maximum, and any notable inflection points on the curve. Use
  highlights to differentiate these key points visually. This chart is intended for
  a data science and analytics presentation, aiming to draw viewers' attention to
  trends and variations in the dataset. The annotations and highlights should aid
  in quickly identifying and understanding the significance of these points.
