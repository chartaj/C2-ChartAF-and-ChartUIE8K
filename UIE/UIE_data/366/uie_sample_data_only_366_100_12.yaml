02_initial_prompt: I need a Treemap chart for Udemy courses from the provided data.
  It should show subjects and break them down by course levels. Each rectangle should
  represent a course. The size of each rectangle should correspond to the number of
  subscribers, and the color should reflect the price range. This way, we can easily
  understand which subjects are popular and how course levels differ within subjects.
  Additionally, include course titles as labels if possible for better clarity. Thank
  you!
