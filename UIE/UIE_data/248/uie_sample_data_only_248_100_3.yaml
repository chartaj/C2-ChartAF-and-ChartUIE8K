  Create a stacked column chart to visualize the differential gene expression in Taxol-resistant
  breast cancer cell lines. The chart should display the ''Cell Line'' on the x-axis,
  with different colors representing each unique ''Gene.symbol''. The y-axis should
  show the log fold change (''logFC'') values. Each cell line should have stacked
  bars showing the logFC for different genes, and labels should indicate the corresponding
  ''P.Value''. This will help us understand how specific genes are upregulated or
  downregulated in different cell lines in response to Taxol.
