  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

  gene symbols?

  6. Do you have a preference for the scaling of the heatmap (e.g., log scale, linear
  scale)?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend explaining the color intensities and annotations?

  8. Would you like to include any titles, subtitles, or labels on the axes for better
  clarity?

  9. Are there specific instructions for grouping or clustering similar cell lines
