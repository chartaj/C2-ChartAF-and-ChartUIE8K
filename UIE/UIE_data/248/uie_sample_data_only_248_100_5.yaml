  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the specific colors, perhaps you can choose.

  2. I do not have a specific preference for the title style.

  3. Yes, please include axis labels. "Gene Symbols" for the x-axis and "log-Fold
  Change (logFC)" for the y-axis.

  4. Highlight the genes with the highest and lowest logFC values using different
  colors.

  5. I do not have any specific font preferences or sizes.

  6. I am not sure if the bars should be grouped or stacked.

  7. I do not know; maybe arrange them by logFC value.

  8. I prefer vertical bars.

  9. Gridlines would be helpful; I don''t have a preference for the style or color.
