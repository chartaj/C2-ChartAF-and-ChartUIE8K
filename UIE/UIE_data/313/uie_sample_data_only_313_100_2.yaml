  Focus on visualizing the populations of Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria from 1970
  to 2022. Include annotations to highlight significant population growth or decline
  in specific years for these countries. Use different colors to represent each country
  and include highlights to emphasize population peaks and dips. The purpose is to
  easily compare the population changes over time for these three countries and understand
  their growth trends. This will help in social science research and global demographic
  studies.
