  2. I''m not sure, maybe you can suggest a common threshold used in astronomy?

  3. I would like unusual redshift values to be annotated with labels.

  4. I am not sure, maybe just the redshift value?

  5. I don''t know.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. I do not know.

  8. Yes, a legend would be useful.
