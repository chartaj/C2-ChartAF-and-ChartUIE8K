  I have data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR14 related to space and astronomy.
  I want to create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of some parameters.
  Specifically, I''d like to see how the ''g'' and ''r'' magnitudes are distributed
  for different ''class'' categories (''STAR'' and ''GALAXY''). The violin plot should
  have ''class'' on the x-axis and the magnitudes on the y-axis. Please ensure each
  class category is represented in the plot.
