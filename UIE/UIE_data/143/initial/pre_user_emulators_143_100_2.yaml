2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between the "assumed_office"
  and "born" columns for members of the U.S. 117th House of Representatives. Use the
  "party" column to color-code the points, distinguishing between Republicans and
  other party members. Implement text annotations to highlight members with unique
  educational backgrounds. The plot should emphasize the distribution of ages at which
  members assumed office. The purpose is to understand if there's a pattern or trend
  in the age of members when they first took office. Add a title and appropriate axis
  labels for clarity.
