  Please create a heatmap based on the Bitcoin data from 9th-Apr-2014 to 30th-Dec-2022.
  The heatmap should visualize the correlation between different numerical variables
  such as ''priceUSD'', ''size'', ''transactions'', ''mining_profitability'', ''marketcap'',
  ''transactionfees'', ''tweets'', and ''google_trends''. This will help to understand
  how these variables are interconnected. Make sure to handle any missing values and
  use an appropriate color gradient to differentiate the levels of correlation. The
