  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I do not know.

  3. Yes, the title could be "Distribution of Park Scores in San Francisco".

  4. Specific bin sizes are not necessary, auto-determined bins are fine.

  5. Evenly distributed score ranges on the x-axis would be good.

  6. I have no specific preference.'
