09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference.

  2. I am not sure; maybe use brighter or bolder colors to emphasize?

  3. I do not know, perhaps simple and clear annotations?

  4. I am not sure.

  5. I do not know.

  6. Solid lines would be fine.

  7. I do not have any specific preference for size.

  8. Yes, a title would be great. Something like "San Francisco Park Scores Over Time."

  9. I do not have a specific preference.

  10. I am not sure which ones, but any parks showing significant trends or anomalies
  should be emphasized.'
