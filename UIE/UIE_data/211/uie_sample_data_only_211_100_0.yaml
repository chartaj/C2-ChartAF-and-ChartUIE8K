02_initial_prompt: Create a geographic heatmap to visualize San Francisco Park Scores.
  The map should highlight parks with various facility types by their scores. Use
  color gradients to represent different score levels, focusing on parks with extreme
  scores for emphasis. Incorporate text annotations to display park names and scores
  for selected parks. Highlight parks with the highest and lowest scores to draw attention.
  Include the ability to filter by facility type and state. Ensure the map includes
  context such as zip codes, perimeter lengths, and acres for better understanding.
  The goal is to present real-estate data effectively for analysis.
