2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing R&D Investment (Billion USD) on the x-axis and
  R&D Investment as % of GDP on the y-axis for different countries. Use data-driven
  text annotations for the United States, China, and Japan to highlight their specific
  values on the plot. Employ highlights to make these three countries stand out visually
  from the others, aiming to emphasize their significant investment in R&D. The chart
  should serve to illustrate the relationship between the absolute and relative R&D
  investments and draw attention to key players in global R&D efforts.
