  in online education. The x-axis should represent the different age groups, and the
  y-axis should represent the percentage of students at each adaptivity level (Low,
  Moderate, High). Each line on the chart should represent different financial conditions
  (Poor, Mid, Rich). The chart should help visualize how adaptability levels change
