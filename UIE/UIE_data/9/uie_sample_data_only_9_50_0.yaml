  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. What color scheme do you prefer for distinguishing different levels
  of agricultural value added per worker?

  2. Do you prefer any specific countries to be highlighted, or should it be based
  solely on the data?

  3. Should the annotations for specific high and low values include detailed text
  or just numeric values?

  4. Do you have any preferences for the geographic projection used in the choropleth
  map?

  5. Should the color scale be linear or logarithmic to better capture the range of
  the data?

  6. Is there a specific legend format you prefer for the map?

  7. Do you want to include any additional contextual information or reference lines
  on the map?

  8. What is your preferred way to display trends and patterns, such as using gradients
  or thresholds for specific value ranges?
