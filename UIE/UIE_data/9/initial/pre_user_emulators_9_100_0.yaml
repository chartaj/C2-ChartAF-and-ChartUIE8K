2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map displaying the value added per worker in agriculture, forestry,
  and fishing across different countries from 1991. Highlight the countries with the
  highest and lowest values to emphasize disparities. Use text annotations to display
  the top 5 and bottom 5 performing countries' values. This visualization aims to
  provide a clear overview of agricultural productivity by country, helping identify
  regions with high and low efficiency. It's practical for analysts needing to quickly
  assess global agricultural productivity trends and disparities in crop yields and
  related economic activities.
