- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

- Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the blood donation data, focusing on Recency,
  Frequency, Monetary, Time, and Class. Label the columns and highlight key data points
  for clear comparison. Use text annotations to emphasize important values and trends,
  such as the highest frequency or monetary contributions over time. Ensure the Class
  variable is represented to distinguish categories. This chart will help health organizations
  analyze donation patterns and target specific donor segments effectively. Please
  make the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret for better decision-making
  regarding blood donation strategies.
