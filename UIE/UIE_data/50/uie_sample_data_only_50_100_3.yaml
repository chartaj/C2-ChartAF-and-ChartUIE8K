02_initial_prompt: Create a pie chart to visualize the impact of different social
  platforms on online shopping behavior based on the given data. Highlight the proportion
  of each platform (Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.) influencing online purchases.
  Ensure each segment of the pie chart is labeled with the corresponding platform
  name and its percentage. This will help in understanding the primary drivers behind
  social media-influenced shopping for marketing strategies. Use distinct colors for
  each segment to clearly differentiate the platforms. The focus should be on overall
  trends, so there's no need for detailed segment-by-segment breakdowns.
