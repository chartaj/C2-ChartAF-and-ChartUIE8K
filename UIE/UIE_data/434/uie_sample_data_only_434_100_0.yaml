02_initial_prompt: Create a histogram using the Tour de France data from 1903 to 2019.
  The x-axis should represent the years (edition) and the y-axis should show the number
  of stage wins. Use text annotations to highlight the years with the highest and
  lowest stage wins. Additionally, employ highlights to distinguish the years with
  significant differences in data, such as the year with the shortest time margin
  between the winner and the runner-up. The purpose is to identify trends and significant
  events throughout the history of the race. The chart should visually capture the
  evolution of the race in terms of challenging stages.
