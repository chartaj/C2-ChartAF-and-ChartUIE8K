  across German university courses. Use the 'Tuition Fees' column from the provided
  data. Highlight the bars with specific fee ranges to emphasize trends or notable
  data points, such as no tuition fees or higher fee categories. Annotate these highlights
  to draw attention to key insights, like the number of courses that are particularly
  affordable or expensive. This visualization helps prospective students understand
  the financial aspects of studying in Germany. Use annotations to provide contextual
  information, focusing on courses with significant differences in tuition fees.
