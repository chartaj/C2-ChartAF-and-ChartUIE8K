07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a gradient to show different densities, and if so, do
  you have a preference for specific colors in the gradient?

  3. Would you like city names to be labeled directly on the heatmap?

  4. Should we include a legend to indicate what different colors or levels of density
  represent?

  5. Do you have a preference for the base map style (e.g., street map, satellite
  imagery)?

  6. Would you like the map to display country or state boundaries in addition to
  city locations?

  7. Do you want to represent the density of universities using a specific unit (e.g.,
  number of universities per 100,000 residents)?

  8. Should any cities or regions be highlighted or emphasized more than others?

  9. Is there a specific geographic scope you want to focus on (e.g., a particular
  country or continent)?

  10. Do you require any additional annotations or information on the heatmap, such
  as major university names or notable landmarks?'
