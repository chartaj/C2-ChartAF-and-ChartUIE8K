- "<start of the annotation list>\n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Dot plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Dot plot that utilizes
  all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a dot plot to visualize the data from the CSV file. The x-axis should represent
  the 'Planned costs' in Billion Euros, and the y-axis should represent the 'Actual
  costs' in Billion Euros. Each project's description should be shown on the dot's
  hover text for better clarity. Please make sure the dots are labeled with the respective
  project names like 'Elbphilharmonie', 'Electronic Health Insurance Card', and 'Flughafen
  Berlin'. Use different colors for each project to distinguish them easily. Make
  the chart visually appealing and easy to interpret.
