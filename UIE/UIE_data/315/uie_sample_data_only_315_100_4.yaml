09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. No, I do not have specific animals I want emphasized.

  3. Circles would be great for the data points markers.

  4. Include full units like ''Height (cm)''.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for easier comparison.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I have no specific preference for line styles.

  8. Yes, the chart should include a title and subtitle. The title could be "Comparison
  of Animal Statistics" and the subtitle could be "Average Speed, Height, and Weight."

  9. Yes, please display numerical values at each data point.

  10. I do not have any preferences for excluding or focusing on specific animals.'
