  Please create a histogram chart to visualize the distribution of the Molecular Weight
  and Residue Weight for different amino acids. The chart should have two histograms
  side by side: one for the Molecular Weight and one for the Residue Weight. Ensure
  that the x-axis represents the weight values and the y-axis represents the count
  or frequency of amino acids falling into those weight bins. This visualization will
