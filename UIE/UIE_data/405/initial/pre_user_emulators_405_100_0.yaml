2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a scatter plot to visualize our business data related to the average
  sale index over a period of 100 days. Each point should represent the 'sale_index'
  of a specific day. Annotate key data points with their values to highlight significant
  trends, especially those with unusually high or low sale indexes. Use colors or
  larger markers to emphasize these points. Add annotations to provide context or
  insights, such as identifying peak sales days. This will help us quickly understand
  trends and identify any outliers in our sales performance over time.
