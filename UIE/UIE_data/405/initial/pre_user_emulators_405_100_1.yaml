2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart visualizing the 'days' versus 'sale_index' data. Annotate key
  data points to highlight notable sales trends and confidence intervals. Use different
  colors to make these annotations stand out. Ensure the x-axis is labeled 'Days'
  and the y-axis as 'Sale Index'. This chart intends to provide an overview of the
  average sale index over time for business analysis. The confidence interval data
  ('CI_left' and 'CI_right') can be represented as shaded areas around the 'sale_index'
  line for better clarity and understanding of the data's variability.
