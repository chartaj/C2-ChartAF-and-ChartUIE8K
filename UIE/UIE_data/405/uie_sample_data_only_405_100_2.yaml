  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the box plot?

  2. Would you like the days to be shown on the x-axis with specific labels or intervals?

  3. Should the whiskers represent all data points within 1.5 IQR of the lower and
  upper quartile or would you prefer a different range for the whiskers?

  4. How should outliers be marked (e.g., as dots, different color, etc.)?

  5. Is there a specific style or format in which you would like the median to be
  annotated?

  6. Do you want gridlines on the plot for better readability?

  7. Should the plot include a title and axis labels? If so, please provide the desired
