2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a heatmap using the data focused on "Gender Classification" within
  a psychology context. The heatmap should illustrate the distribution of preferences
  (Favorite Color, Music Genre, Beverage, and Soft Drink) across different genders.
  Additionally, include annotations to highlight interesting data points, especially
  those with high frequency. Use heatmap color variations to accentuate the areas
  with more significant or lesser data points. The intent is to visualize gender-based
  patterns and differences in preferences clearly, aiding in psychological analysis.
  Ensure missing values are irrelevant as there are none in this dataset.
