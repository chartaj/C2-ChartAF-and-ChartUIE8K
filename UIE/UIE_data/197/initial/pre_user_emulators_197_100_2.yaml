- '<start of user instruction>

  Create a mosaic plot visualizing the relationship between the variables: Favorite
  Color, Favorite Music Genre, Favorite Beverage, Favorite Soft Drink, and Gender.
  Highlight elements to distinguish patterns in preferences based on gender. Text
  annotations should specifically point out notable trends such as favorite music
  genres among different genders. This visualization will help understand psychological
  tendencies linked to color, beverage, and soft drink preferences. Keep the chart
  detailed to explore the interconnectedness of these preferences but ensure it remains
  clear and easy to interpret for better insights.
