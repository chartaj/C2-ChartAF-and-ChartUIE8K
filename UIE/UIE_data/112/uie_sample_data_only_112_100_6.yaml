02_initial_prompt: Create a treemap visualization to depict the caffeine content of
  drinks. Use data from the provided CSV file showing various drinks, their volume
  in ml, calories, caffeine content in mg, and type. Make sure to highlight different
  types of drinks (e.g., coffee, energy drinks) and their caffeine content distinctly.
  In each section of the treemap, include the name of the drink and its caffeine content
  visually apparent. The size of each section should correspond to the volume of the
  drink. This will help in understanding the distribution of caffeine across different
  drink types.

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
