  of various drink types from the given dataset. Ensure the x-axis represents the
  different types of drinks (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Energy Drinks) and the y-axis shows
  the caffeine content in milligrams. This will help compare the caffeine distribution
  across different types. Use the sample data to identify unique drink types and their
