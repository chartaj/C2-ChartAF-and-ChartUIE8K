2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the production of craft beer from 2009 for different
  brewer sizes. Plot 'total_barrels' on the y-axis and 'year' on the x-axis, separating
  data points by 'brewer_size'. Use text annotations to display 'n_of_brewers' on
  each data point to highlight key differences. Include highlights to emphasize data
  points with missing values in 'total_barrels' and 'total_shipped'. This will help
  in understanding the trends in production volume across various brewer sizes and
  years, with special attention to potential data irregularities.
