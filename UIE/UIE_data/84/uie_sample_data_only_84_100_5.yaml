  Plot 'ph' on the x-axis and 'Conductivity' on the y-axis. Use different colors to
  represent 'Potability' values, where 0 is non-potable and 1 is potable. This will
  help visualize any correlation between pH levels and conductivity and if it affects
  potability. Additionally, add trend lines to observe potential patterns or relationships
  in the data. Ensure the plot has clear labels, a legend, and is easy to interpret.

09_answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme for the data points based on
  ''Potability''.

  2. I am not sure about the style or type of trend lines; you can choose what seems
  appropriate.

  3. I have no specific preference for the marker shapes or sizes for the data points.

  4. I do not know about the font style or size for the axis labels and legend.

  5. I am not sure about the background of the chart; you can use your best judgment.

  6. Yes, please title the axes and the chart. The x-axis should be titled "pH", the
  y-axis should be titled "Conductivity", and the chart should be titled "Scatter
  Plot of pH vs Conductivity with Potability".

  7. I have no specific preference for the legend position.

  8. I do not need any additional annotations or data point labels in the chart.'
