  for the most streamed Spotify songs in 2023. Make sure to use the "streams" column
  from the data provided. Additionally, color-code the bars by "released_month" to
  see if there's any trend in streaming counts based on the month the song was released.
  Ensure each bar represents a range of streaming counts, and the x-axis should show
  these count ranges. The y-axis should reflect the frequency of songs within those
  ranges. Please label both axes clearly and include a legend for the colors used.
