02_initial_prompt: Create a Choropleth map to visualize Indian startup funding distribution
  across different cities. Use the 'City Location' for geographic mapping and 'Amount
  in USD' to indicate funding amounts with varying color intensities. Include text
  annotations for top cities like Bengaluru, Gurgaon, and others to highlight significant
  funding amounts and investor details. The purpose is to illustrate funding concentration
  and investor activity, which can guide stakeholders in understanding regional investments
  better. Highlights should emphasize cities with exceptional funding amounts to showcase
  hotspots in the investment landscape. This helps in strategic planning and investment
  decisions.
