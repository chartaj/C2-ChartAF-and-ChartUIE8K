- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart visualizing global video game sales over time from the provided
  dataset. Highlight and annotate top-selling games with specific sales figures to
  draw attention to key data points. Use different colors to represent various platforms
  and genres for better distinction. Include missing years data on the x-axis and
  overall sales on the y-axis. Emphasize trends over time and publisher impact. Provide
  context by noting the dip in sales for specific periods and reasons. Make sure the
  chart is engaging and easy to interpret for both industry experts and casual viewers.
