  from the US Police Shootings dataset. Specifically, I want to see how age, gender,
  race, signs_of_mental_illness, threat_level, manner_of_death, and armed status correlate.
  The dataset columns should be used as axes to display how frequently these combinations
  occur. The heatmap should highlight areas with higher frequencies in darker colors.
  This will help identify patterns and relationships between these factors in the
