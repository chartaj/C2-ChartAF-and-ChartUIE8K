2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a grouped bar chart comparing the impact of COVID-19 across different sectors.
  Use "Branche" as categories and group by "Home-Office", "mit Lohn", "ohne Lohn",
  "Kurzarbeit", "arbeitslos", and "wie bisher". Annotate the highest and lowest values
  for each category to highlight extremes. Ensure the x-axis represents different
  sectors and the y-axis shows the number of people. This will help visualize how
  each sector was affected and which categories had significant changes. Include a
  title and labels for clarity. Highlight notable sectors with distinct colors.
