  branches from the provided data. This table should include columns for Branche,
  Home-Office, mit Lohn, ohne Lohn, Kurzarbeit, arbeitslos, and wie bisher. Add text
  annotations for the highest and lowest values in each column to highlight significant
  differences. The chart will help visualize the impact of varying employment conditions
