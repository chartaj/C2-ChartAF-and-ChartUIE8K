07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for highlighting ''fear'' and
  ''anger'' peaks?

  2. Would you like to include gridlines in the background of the chart for better
  readability?

  3. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the text annotations of the peaks?

  4. Should the x-axis represent specific time intervals (e.g., days, weeks) or be
  adjusted automatically based on data distribution?

  5. Are there any other specific emotions apart from ''fear'' and ''anger'' that
  you want to be highlighted or treated differently?

  6. Do you have a preference for the overall chart theme (e.g., light, dark)?

  7. Would you like any additional labels or legends to be included in the chart for
  further clarification?

  8. Should the chart display include markers at all data points or only at the peaks?

  9. Are there any specific non-data-driven annotations you want to include in the
  chart for context?'

09_answers: '1. I don''t have a preference, you can choose what works best.

  2. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  3. I am not sure, you can select what looks most readable.

  4. I am not sure, but adjusting automatically based on data distribution sounds
  good.

  5. No, just ''fear'' and ''anger'' are fine.

  6. I do not know, you can choose the theme that makes the chart clearer.

  7. Yes, including labels or legends would be helpful for clarification.

  8. Only at the peaks, please.

  9. I don''t have specific annotations in mind, so you can decide what''s necessary
  for context.'
