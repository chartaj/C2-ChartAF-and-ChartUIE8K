  1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like the annotations for key data points to be highlighted with bold
  text and a slightly different color.

  3. Yes, the heatmap should include a legend explaining the color intensity.

  4. I do not have a specific preference.

  5. Comments with extreme emotions could be those with the highest and lowest values,
  but I am not sure about a specific threshold.

  6. I do not know.

  7. I do not have a specific preference.

  8. I do not know.

  9. I am not sure.

  10. Yes, the heatmap should be titled "Emotion Distribution in Comments" with a
