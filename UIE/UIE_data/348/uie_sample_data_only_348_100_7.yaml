  Please create a bar chart to visualize my Settlers of Catan games data. Specifically,
  I want to compare the total points scored by each player across different games.
  Use ''gameNum'' on the x-axis and ''points'' on the y-axis. Differentiate between
  players using different colors or labels. This will help me see which player scores
  the most points consistently and in which games. Additionally, if possible, indicate
  the "totalGain" and "totalLoss" as separate bar charts alongside the points for
