2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a line chart visualizing employment growth trends using LinkedIn data
  for various industries. Plot the ISIC section, ISIC section name, industry_sk, and
  industry name. Highlight different industrial groups and divisions with distinct
  colors. Add text annotations to emphasize key data points and trends, especially
  where notable increases or dips in employment growth occur. The purpose is to provide
  insights into employment trends across the agriculture sector and other industries,
  helping businesses and analysts understand where job growth is occurring. Use highlights
  to draw attention to the most significant changes.
