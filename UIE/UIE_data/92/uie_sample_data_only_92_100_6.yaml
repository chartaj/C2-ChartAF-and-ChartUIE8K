07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or gradient for the choropleth
  map to represent life expectancy?

  2. Are there specific colors you prefer for the markers representing different socio-economic
  factors such as undernourishment, CO2 emissions, health expenditure, education expenditure,
  and unemployment rates?

  3. What range of values should be used to categorize life expectancy for the color-coding?
  For example, low, medium, high.

  4. How would you like to handle countries with missing data? Should they be color-coded
  in a specific way or left out?

  5. Do you want the markers indicating socio-economic factors to vary in size or
  shape based on their values?

  6. Should the map focus on recent data, a specific year, or an average over a range
  of years?

  7. Is there a specific geographic projection you prefer for the map (e.g., Mercator,
  Robinson)?

  8. Are there any additional annotations or labels you want to be included on the
  map besides tooltips?

  9. Do you have preferences for the design or placement of the legend explaining
  the color-coding and markers?

  10. Should the map include any specific regional boundaries or highlights for better
