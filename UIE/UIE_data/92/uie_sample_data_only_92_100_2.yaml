  expenditure, and education expenditure by country and income group over the years.
  Highlight differences across regions and income groups, and add data-driven text
  annotations for life expectancy and health expenditure to emphasize key insights.
  The chart should help identify socio-economic disparities and trends in public spending
  on health and education. Use color highlights to differentiate regions and income
  groups, and include corruption data as non-data-driven annotations to provide additional
  context. The purpose is to assess how socio-economic factors influence life expectancy
  and public expenditure.
