02_initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize investments from Shark Tank
  India. Each bubble should represent a brand, sized by the investment amount. Position
  bubbles based on episode number and highlight those with equity stakes of different
  percentages. Annotations should display brand names and investment details. Use
  different colors for each shark involved. The purpose is to easily compare investment
  sizes and involvement of sharks across episodes. Include text and highlight elements
  to emphasize significant deals. This visual aid helps quickly grasp investment patterns
