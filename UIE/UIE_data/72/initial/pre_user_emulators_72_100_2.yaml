2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot visualizing the number of terrorist attacks over the years
  for various entities. Highlight entities with the most attacks. Annotate significant
  changes or trends in terrorist activity. The chart aims to provide a clear view
  of how terrorist attacks have evolved and which regions are most affected. Ensure
  data points are distinct and annotations explain notable increases or decreases.
  Given missing values in the 'Code' column, consider focusing annotations on 'Entity'
  and 'Year' for clarity. This visualization should help identify and focus on critical
  regions and periods in global terrorism trends.
