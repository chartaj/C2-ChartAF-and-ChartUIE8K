02_initial_prompt: I am working on a data project about global terrorism incidents.
  Specifically, I want to visualize the number of terrorist attacks per year for different
  countries. I've provided a data sample showing columns for Entity, Code, Year, and
  Terrorist attacks. Could you please create a bar chart that displays the total number
  of terrorist attacks for each year, combining all countries? Make sure the x-axis
  represents the years, and the y-axis represents the total number of terrorist attacks.
  This will help me understand the trends in terrorist activity over time. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
