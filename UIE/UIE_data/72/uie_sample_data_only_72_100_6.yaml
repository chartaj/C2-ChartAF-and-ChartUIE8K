  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for distinguishing between
  years with complete data and those with missing values in the "Code" field?

  2. Would you like to add any specific annotations or labels to highlight particular
  years or data points in the histogram?

  3. Do you have any preferences for the bin width or the number of bins in the histogram?

  4. Should the x-axis labels display every year, or would you prefer a specific interval
  (e.g., every 5 or 10 years) for better readability?

  5. Are there any particular font styles or sizes you would like to use for the titles
  and labels on the axes?

  6. Would you like a legend included to explain the color coding used for years with
  complete data versus those with missing values?'

09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific preference for the color scheme.

  2. I am not sure about adding specific annotations or labels.

  3. I do not know.

  4. Displaying the x-axis labels at specific intervals, like every 5 years, would
  be preferable for better readability.

  5. I do not have any preferences for the font styles or sizes.

  6. Yes, please include a legend to explain the color coding used for years with
  complete data versus those with missing values.'
