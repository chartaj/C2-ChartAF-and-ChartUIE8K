07_questions: '1. Do you have any specific color preferences for the dots or background
  of the chart?

  2. Would you prefer the chart to include grid lines for better readability? If yes,
  should they be both horizontal and vertical, or just one of the two?

  3. Should the chart include labels for each dot indicating the exact distance values,
  or should it only display dots?

  4. Do you want any specific markers or shapes for the dots, or are default circular
  dots acceptable?

  5. Would you like the chart to include a legend or additional annotations for better
  understanding?

  6. Do you have a preferred font style or size for the axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the distances be represented in km or miles, or should it be indicated
  in both units?

  8. Is there a specific order you want the cities (Origins) to be displayed on the
  x-axis (e.g., alphabetical or by some other criteria)?

  9. Are there any specific city pairs or distances that you want to highlight or
  emphasize in the chart?

  10. Would you like to set a limit on the range of distances displayed on the y-axis,
  or should it auto-adjust to the data?'
