02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap for the Indian Grocery Prices in Sydney dataset.
  Use Product Categories as rows and Product Names as columns with product prices
  in INR as the metric. The heatmap should visually represent price variations in
  different product categories. Ensure the color scale accurately reflects price differences,
  with distinct colors for lower and higher price ranges. Missing values must be highlighted
  if any. Include annotations for exact prices on the heatmap cells for precise reference.
  This visual should help us identify which product categories have higher or lower
  overall prices quickly.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
