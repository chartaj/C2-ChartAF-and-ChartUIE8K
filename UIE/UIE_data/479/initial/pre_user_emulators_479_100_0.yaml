2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart illustrating the usage share of different web browsers. Highlight
  the segments representing Chrome and Safari, as they dominate the market. Include
  text annotations for these highlighted segments to display their exact usage share
  percentages. The visualization aims to compare browser popularity, guiding decisions
  for web development priorities. Focus annotations on Chrome and Safari to emphasize
  their significant market shares. This will help developers target their optimizations
  effectively, enhancing user experience based on the most widely used browsers. Make
  sure the chart is easy to read and visually appealing for clear communication of
  the data insights.
