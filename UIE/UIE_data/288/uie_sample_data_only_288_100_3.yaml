  Please create a pie chart visualizing the distribution of the ''diagnosis'' column
  in the Breast Cancer Dataset [Wisconsin Diagnostic UCI]. The chart should show the
  percentage of ''M'' (Malignant) and ''B'' (Benign) diagnoses. Ensure that each section
  is clearly labeled with both the category and the percentage value. Use different
  colors for each category to enhance readability. This pie chart will help in understanding
