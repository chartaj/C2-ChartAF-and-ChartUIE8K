  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  I have data on near-Earth comets with various parameters like Epoch, TP, e, i, w,
  Node, q, Q, P, MOID, A1, A2, A3, DT, and object names. Can you create a box chart

  I want to see the spread and identify any potential outliers for these orbital elements
  and parameters for the different comets in my dataset. Thank you!
