  across counties in the United States. Highlight areas with the highest and lowest
  broadband access. Use annotations to indicate noteworthy trends or regions with
  particularly high or low availability. The map should effectively distinguish high-access
  areas from low-access ones using color coding. Utilize available data columns to
  create this visualization. The purpose is to focus attention on broadband distribution
