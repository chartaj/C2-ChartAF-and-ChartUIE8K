2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map visualizing broadband availability by county in the United
  States, based on the given data. Highlight counties with varying broadband availability
  to depict disparities. Use text annotations to point out areas with extreme low
  or high availability, providing crucial context. Ensure the map focuses on identifying
  broadband black spots and well-connected areas. This visualization serves to direct
  attention to critical regions needing infrastructure improvement. Annotations must
  emphasize important disparities, and colors should distinctly reflect different
  levels of broadband access across counties for clear visual communication.
