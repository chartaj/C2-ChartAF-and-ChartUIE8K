  Data attributes MUST match exactly the column names of the data.

  Store the selected task from the task types in query[''Task''].

  Store the purpose of visualization in query[''Purpose''].

  Store the prospective audience in query[''Audience''].

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. What color scheme would you prefer for the heatmap to distinguish
  different levels of broadband availability?

  2. Should the legend be placed on a particular side of the heatmap (e.g., top, bottom,
  left, right)?

  3. Do you have specific regions in mind for text annotations, or should we focus
  on the most significant data points?

  4. Is there a preferred font style or size for the text annotations?

  5. Would you like to use percentile ranges or specific value ranges to define the
  color intensities for broadband availability?

  6. Should the map include state and county boundaries, or focus solely on counties?

  7. Do you want the levels of missing values to be highlighted with a different pattern
  or color than the broadband availability?

  8. Should we include a title and subtitle on the heatmap? If so, do you have preferred
  wording for them?

  9. Do you want to display any additional data (e.g., demographic information) alongside
  the broadband availability information?'
