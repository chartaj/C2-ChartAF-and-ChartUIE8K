  over the years 1970, 1971, and 1972. Include axes for Living Planet Index, Upper
  CI, and Lower CI. Each year's data should be plotted to show the range between Upper
  and Lower CI values. Overall, demonstrate how the Living Planet Index and its confidence
  intervals have varied for Africa within these years. Make sure the radar chart is
  easy to read and visually engaging for understanding fluctuations in the Living
  Planet Index, while ensuring the biology aspect is emphasized.
