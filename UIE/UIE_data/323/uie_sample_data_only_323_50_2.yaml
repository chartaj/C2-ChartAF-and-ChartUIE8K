  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used in the heatmap?

  2. Should the heatmap use a specific color gradient to represent different levels
  of resource allocation?

  3. How would you like the high resource allocation states to be highlighted? (e.g.,
  using a different color, a border, etc.)

  4. Do you have any specific states that you want annotated aside from those with
  high resource allocation?

  5. What level of resource allocation would you consider as "high"?

  6. Would you prefer the annotations to be in a specific format or style?

  7. Should the heatmap include a legend to explain the color gradient and what they
  represent?

  8. How detailed do you want the annotations to be? (e.g., just the state name, or
  include specific allocation details)

  9. Do you have any preference for the font size or type used in the chart?

  10. Should the chart include any additional contextual information, such as a title
