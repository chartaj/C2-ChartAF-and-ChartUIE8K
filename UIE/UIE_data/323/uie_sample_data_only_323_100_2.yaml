07_questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the heatmap to
  ensure distinct comparisons?

  2. What level of granularity do you prefer for the color scale (e.g., high, medium,
  low)?

  3. Would you like to include numerical annotations for all states or only for those
  with the highest and lowest values?

  4. Do you have a preferred method of annotating the highest and lowest values (e.g.,
  bold text, different color, or special markers)?

  5. Is there a particular format for the labels or fonts that you would like to see
  used in the heatmap?

  6. Would you like to incorporate any additional contextual elements, such as state
