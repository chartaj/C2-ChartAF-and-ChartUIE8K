2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I want a box chart visualizing the Bitcoin Bull-Run Prediction Dataset, specifically
  focusing on the 'Closing Price (USD)' over time. Highlight the overall trend and
  any significant deviations in the pricing data. Include text annotations to highlight
  the range of '24h High (USD)' and '24h Low (USD)'. The chart should emphasize the
  extreme high and low price points to show the volatility. Use color highlights to
  differentiate the most volatile periods. Ensure the visual is intuitive to help
  in understanding the historical price changes and predict future trends.
