09_answers: '1. I have no specific color preferences.

  2. For ''significantly higher'' or ''significantly lower,'' let''s use a threshold
  of 10% change between the 24h High/24h Low and 24h Open.

  3. I am not sure about the style or theme.

  4. It should strictly be a scatter plot, no lines connecting the points.

  5. I prefer having both major and minor gridlines for better readability.

  6. I have no specific preference for date format on the x-axis.

  7. The chart title should emphasize both Bitcoin''s price movement and significant
  fluctuations during bull-run periods.

  8. I do not know about any specific font preferences for labels and legends.'
