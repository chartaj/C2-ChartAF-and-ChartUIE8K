  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a stacked bar chart to predict heart disease visualizing ''Age'' vs. ''TenYearCHD''.
  Use color highlights to differentiate between males and females in the ''male''
  column. Include annotations to display the ''cigsPerDay'' value for each age group.
  This will help in identifying the relationship between age, gender, smoking habits,
  and heart disease risk. Maintain practical visualization by focusing on essential
  data points like age, gender, smoking, and heart disease prediction.
