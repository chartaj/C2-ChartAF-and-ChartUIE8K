2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart to visualize the coin price over a period of 10 months. Highlight
  significant price changes and focus on particular dates like April 14, 2018, when
  the price was 8140.71, and April 16, 2018, with a value of 8371.15. Use text annotations
  to emphasize these key points. This visualization will help in understanding the
  trends and fluctuations in the cryptocurrency market over the specified period.
  Ensure the chart provides a clear view of the overall performance while drawing
  attention to critical price movements for better analysis and insight.
