09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I would like to focus on Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Kolkata.

  3. I have no specific preference.

  4. No additional information beyond hotel names and addresses is needed.

  5. Yes, I would like to include grid lines for better readability.

  6. I am not sure.

  7. Only year labels on the X-axis would be fine.

  8. The Y-axis should start at zero.

  9. I do not know.

  10. The chart title could be "Trend of Hotel Room Availability in Major Indian Cities"
  and a subtitle "Tracking Growth and Decline Over Time". The axes may be labeled
  "Year" for the X-axis and "Total Hotel Rooms" for the Y-axis.'
