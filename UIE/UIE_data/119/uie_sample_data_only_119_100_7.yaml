  I want to visualize the monthly trends in Weekly Sales from the Walmart Sales data.
  Can you create a bar chart that shows the total Weekly Sales for each month? I''d
  like to see the months on the x-axis and the total Weekly Sales on the y-axis. Maybe
  use different colors or patterns for bars representing holiday weeks. Thanks!
