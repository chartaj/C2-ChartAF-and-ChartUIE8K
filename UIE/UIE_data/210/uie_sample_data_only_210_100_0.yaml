  subscribed YouTube channels to highlight distribution and outliers. Add textual
  annotations to emphasize notable values and key influencers like T-Series and Cocomelon.
  Use different colors to distinguish categories such as Music, Education, and Film
  & Animation. Highlight the median and quartiles clearly. The chart should be visually
  appealing and intuitive to understand, making it easy for viewers to grasp the overall
  distribution and identify leading channels in terms of video views. Include a legend
  for categories for better clarity.
