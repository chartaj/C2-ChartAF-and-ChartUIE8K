02_initial_prompt: I have penguin data with columns like species, island, bill dimensions,
  flipper length, body mass, sex, and year. Please create a histogram showing the
  distribution of bill lengths (bill_length_mm). I'd like to see how the bill lengths
  vary among different species. Use distinct colors for each species to make the chart
  more informative. Ensure the histogram bins are appropriately sized to capture the
  range of bill lengths. This will help in understanding the diversity in bill lengths
  among penguins from different species studied over the years. Thanks!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.
