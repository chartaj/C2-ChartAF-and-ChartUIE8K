07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color palette for highlighting different
  categories such as ''type_of_sturcture'' and ''reason_for_demolition''?

  2. Would you like to see separate trend lines for each locality and district, or

  different markers, colors, or annotations)

  4. Do you need specific labels or legends for each category and trend line?

  5. Is there a particular date range you want to focus on, or should the entire dataset
  be displayed?

  6. Do you have any specific preferences for the style or appearance of the line
