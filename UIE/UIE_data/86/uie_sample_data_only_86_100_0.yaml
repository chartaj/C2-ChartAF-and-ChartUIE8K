02_initial_prompt: I want a bar chart visualizing the energy levels of popular songs.
  The x-axis should represent song titles and the y-axis should depict energy values.
  Highlight songs with energy above 0.4. Include data-driven text annotations displaying
  the exact energy values above the respective bars for clarity. This visualization
  will help understand which songs are more energetic. The chart is intended to offer
  a clear comparison of the energy attribute across different songs in a visually
  engaging manner. Please make sure the chart is colorful and easy to read.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
