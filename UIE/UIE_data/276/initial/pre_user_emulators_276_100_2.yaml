2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a grouped bar chart to compare the area and weight of Triticum aestivum across
  different fields and genotypes. Each group should represent a field, and within
  each group, bars should show the area and weight for each genotype. Add text annotations
  to highlight the highest and lowest values within each field. The purpose of this
  visualization is to understand how different genotypes perform in different fields
  in terms of area and weight, aiding agricultural planning and analysis. Use color
  highlights to differentiate between genotypes for easier comparison.
