02_initial_prompt: I would like to create a line chart that visualizes the bird counts
  during Christmas time in the Hamilton area of Ontario. Specifically, I'd like the
  chart to show the trends over the years for different species. The x-axis should
  represent the years, and the y-axis should represent the number of birds counted.
  Please include lines for at least three different species to see how their populations
  have fluctuated over time. The chart should be clear and easy to interpret, making
  it straightforward to compare the populations of different bird species throughout
  the years.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for the lines representing
  different bird species?

  2. Are there any particular bird species you''d like to focus on for the comparison?

  counts?

  4. Do you prefer a particular line style (solid, dashed, dotted) for different species?

  5. Would you like to display a legend to identify the species represented by each
  line?

  6. Do you have a preference for the range or specific intervals on the y-axis?

  7. Should the x-axis include labels for every year or specific intervals (e.g.,
  every 5 years)?

  8. Are there any specific annotations or labels you would like to add to the chart
  to highlight certain events or trends?

  9. Would you like to include a title and subtitle for the chart? If so, do you have
