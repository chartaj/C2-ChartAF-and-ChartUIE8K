02_initial_prompt: Create a scatter plot to visualize the bird counts during Christmas
  time in the Hamilton area of Ontario. Plot "year" on the x-axis and "how_many_counted"
  on the y-axis. Color the points based on the "species" to identify different bird
  species variations over the years. This will help us see trends and changes in bird
  populations over time. Ensure you label the axes appropriately and include a legend
  to differentiate the species. Use a title that reflects the chart's purpose, such
  as "Bird Counts Over the Years During Christmas in Hamilton, Ontario."
