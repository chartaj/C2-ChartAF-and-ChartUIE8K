02_initial_prompt: I want to create a histogram to visualize the bird counts during
  Christmas time in the Hamilton area of Ontario. The x-axis should represent the
  different bird species (both common names and Latin names combined), and the y-axis
  should show the total number of birds counted. Make sure to handle any missing data
  appropriately. Additionally, I'd like another histogram that shows the number of
  birds counted per hour, so the x-axis will be the number of birds counted and the
  y-axis will be the frequency of those counts. Please help me make this.

  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
