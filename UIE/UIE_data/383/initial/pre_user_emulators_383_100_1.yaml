2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a donut chart that visualizes how people evaluate service in a business
  context. The chart should include the columns with the labels such as "Almost Certainly,"
  "Highly Likely," and others down to "Chances Are Slight." Use the "Unique Values"
  data as the values for each category to show their distribution. Add text annotations
  to highlight key areas, such as "Almost Certainly" and "Highly Likely," to draw
  attention to the higher evaluation scores. Additionally, use highlights like different
  colors to distinguish categories clearly. This will help in understanding the evaluation
  distribution visually.
