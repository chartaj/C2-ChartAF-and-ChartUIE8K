2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a geographic heatmap to visualize the Global Metropolis Weather Dataset,
  highlighting temperature variations across different locations, observed at specific
  times. Annotate key points to show temperature, feels like temperature, weather
  conditions, and wind speeds. This will help identify weather patterns and anomalies
  visually. Use color intensity to represent temperature differences and add markers
  for weather conditions. Ensure the map is clear and interactive for better user
  experience, focusing on distinguishing weather impacts across cities. This will
  aid in quick visual analysis of weather data and support informed decision-making.
