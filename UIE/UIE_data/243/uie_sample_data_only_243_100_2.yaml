07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme or palette for representing
  different weather conditions?

  2. How would you like to categorize and code extreme weather patterns (e.g., specific
  colors or highlights)?

  3. What level of detail do you prefer for text annotations (e.g., font size, specific
  positioning within the treemap)?

  4. Should there be a legend or key to explain the color variations and highlights
  used in the treemap?

  5. Do you have a preferred layout or orientation for the treemap (e.g., vertical,
  horizontal)?

  6. Should the context, orientation, and editorial comments be displayed directly
  on the treemap, or would you prefer a separate section for these insights?

  7. Is there a specific threshold for temperatures or humidity levels that you consider
  extreme and want highlighted?

  8. Are there any specific locations or weather conditions that you want to prioritize
  in the visualization?

  9. Would you like to include any additional metadata or contextual information for
  each location (e.g., population, altitude)?

  10. How much contextual and editorial commentary do you want included with the visual
  insights?'
