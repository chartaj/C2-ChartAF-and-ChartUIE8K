2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a Spline chart visualizing bacteria data. The x-axis will represent the bacteria
  names, while the y-axis represents harmfulness to humans (Yes, No). Highlight harmful
  (Yes) bacteria in red and non-harmful ones (No) in green. Annotate key bacteria
  like 'Escherichia coli,' 'Staphylococcus aureus,' and 'Lactobacillus acidophilus'
  to focus attention on where they're commonly found (intestinal tract, skin, nasal
  passages, human mouth & intestine). Emphasize the different families they belong
  to with text annotations for better understanding. This helps in biology studies
  to differentiate and recognize bacteria properties easily.
