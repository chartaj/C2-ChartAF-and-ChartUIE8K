02_initial_prompt: I need a heatmap to visualize the distribution of token counts
  for various authors and titles in the Colonia Corpus of Historical Portuguese (literature-and-linguistics).
  The x-axis should represent the unique authors and the y-axis should represent the
  unique titles. Use a color gradient to depict the range of token counts. Ensure
  that missing values, if any, are appropriately handled or highlighted. This will
  help me identify patterns or anomalies in token distribution across different works
  and authors from the 16th Century subcorpus. Do include labels for easier interpretation.
