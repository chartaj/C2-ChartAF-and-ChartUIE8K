02_initial_prompt: I need a stacked column chart for dance styles and genres data.
  Each column should represent a different dance type, stacked with segments for each
  unique dance style, and their cultural significance. The x-axis should showcase
  the dance types (e.g., American), while the y-axis reflects the number of notable
  characteristics. Use different colors for various dance styles and include a legend.
  The chart will help visualize the prominence and variety within each dance type,
  making it easy to compare their key features. This visualization will be useful
  for understanding the diversity and cultural impact of each dance type.
