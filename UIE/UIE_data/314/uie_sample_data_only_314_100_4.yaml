02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset containing information about Possum regression
  in zoology, including variables like skull width, head length, tail length, and
  others. I want to visualize the relationship between the head length (hdlngth) and
  the skull width (skullw) using a scatter plot. The x-axis should represent the head
  length and the y-axis should represent the skull width. Additionally, can you color-code
  the points by the sex (male or female) of the possums? This will help me understand
  any differences between male and female possums in terms of these two measurements.
  Thank you!
