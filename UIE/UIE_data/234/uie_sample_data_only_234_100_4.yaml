  Create a bar chart that shows the number of customers by Geography (France, Spain,
  and Germany) using the data from the provided dataset. Each bar should represent
  one of the three Geographies and show the count of customers for each. Please include
  labels for each bar indicating the exact number of customers. Also, add a title
  "Customer Distribution by Geography" and label the axes appropriately with "Geography"
  on the x-axis and "Number of Customers" on the y-axis. Ensure the chart is clear
