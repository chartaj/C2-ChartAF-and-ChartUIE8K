  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

  color, larger size, different shape)?

  4. What font style and size do you prefer for the text annotations?

  5. Do you have a preference for the background color or grid line style of the chart?

  6. Should there be any specific labels or titles for the axes, chart title, or legend?

  7. Would you like any additional markers or reference lines (e.g., average line,
  trendline) on the chart?

  8. Do you have any preference for the placement of text annotations (e.g., above,
  below, or next to the highlighted points)?

  9. Is there a particular format for the display of ''y'' values in the annotations
  (e.g., decimal places, scientific notation)?

  10. Should there be any padding or spacing adjustments for better readability of
