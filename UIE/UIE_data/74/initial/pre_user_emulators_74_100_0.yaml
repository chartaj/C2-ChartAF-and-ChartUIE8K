2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a line chart to visualize cybersecurity index trends for different
  countries and regions. Include annotations for specific points to highlight key
  insights, such as data-driven values for countries with extreme index scores. Use
  highlights to distinguish between regions and different indexes (CEI, GCI, NCSI,
  and DDL) by color or line style. The chart should focus on any notable fluctuations,
  trends, and outliers in the data from 74.csv for clearer comparison and analysis.
  The aim is to identify patterns in cybersecurity readiness globally.
