  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
