02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset of GameStop historical stock prices with columns
  like date, open_price, high_price, low_price, close_price, volume, and adjclose_price.
  I want to create a heatmap that visualizes the correlation between these variables
  over time. Please use the data to plot a correlation matrix heatmap. Make sure it
  includes all the columns and highlights relationships, especially focusing on how
  close_price correlates with volume and other price metrics. Additionally, the heatmap
  should be visually appealing, with a color gradient that clearly shows variations
  in correlation strength. Thank you!

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.
