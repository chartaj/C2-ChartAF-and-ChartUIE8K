2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot using the data with columns 'x' and 'y'. Both columns consist
  of float64 data types with no missing values. Highlight specific data points and
  add data-driven text annotations to these points to draw attention to their y-values.
  The scatter plot should visually emphasize key elements to help the viewer focus
  on highlighted areas before examining other points. Ensure that the chart is intuitive
  and aids in data analysis by clearly marking outliers or significant patterns in
  the data.
