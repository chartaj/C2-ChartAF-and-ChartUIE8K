  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Scatter plot that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

- 'Create a scatter plot to visualize the alcohol consumption data around the world.
  Use the ''country'' column for labeling, and plot ''total_litres_of_pure_alcohol''
  on the y-axis against ''beer_servings'' on the x-axis. Color-code the different
  types of alcohol servings: beer, spirits, and wine. This will help in understanding
  the relationship between different types of alcohol consumption and overall alcohol
  intake per country. Ensure to label the axes and include a legend for clarity. The
  chart should provide a clear overview of how alcohol consumption patterns differ
  across countries.'
