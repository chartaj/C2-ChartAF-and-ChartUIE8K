  Given the accurate data and user request, your task is to delve into the user request
  to figure out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select
  the most suitable task that the user is willing to do from the list of various tasks
  in data visualization, (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request
  in data visualization, and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
