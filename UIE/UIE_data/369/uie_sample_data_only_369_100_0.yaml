02_initial_prompt: Create a line chart visualizing air travel between major US cities.
  Use the "weight" column for the line values, representing the intensity of travel,
  with different lines for each "region". Highlight significant cities such as New
  York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, to draw attention to their travel weights. Add data-driven
  text annotations to these highlighted cities to display their travel weights. This
  will help in understanding the travel dynamics and regional connections among these
  major cities and provide insights into passenger movements.
