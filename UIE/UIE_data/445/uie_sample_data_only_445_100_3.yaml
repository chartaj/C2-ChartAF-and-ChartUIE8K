02_initial_prompt: Create a heatmap based on the Dubois challenge tweets data, focusing
  on the interaction metrics (retweet_count, like_count, and quote_count) across various
  usernames. This should help highlight which users are generating more engagement.
  Ensure the heatmap shows an easily interpretable gradient and includes appropriate
  axis labels and a color legend. Include New York location data points if possible.
  Use consistent color coding to represent the intensity of engagement. Additionally,
  label data points with Twitter usernames for better insights.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
