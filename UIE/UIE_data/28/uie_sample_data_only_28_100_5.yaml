02_initial_prompt: I'd like a stacked bar chart showing the distribution of different
  car categories by manufacturer. Please use the 'Category' and 'Manufacturer' columns
  to create this visualization. Each bar should represent a manufacturer, and the
  sections of the bar should represent the different categories. The chart should
  help identify which manufacturers produce the most Jeeps, Hatchbacks, etc. Additionally,
  use different colors for each category for better distinction. This will help me
  understand the variety of car categories each manufacturer offers in the dataset.
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
  expert.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
