2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a grouped bar chart comparing the share of CO2 emissions from air travel
  with the share of the world population for different income countries. Highlight
  and annotate bars for "High income countries" and "Upper-middle income countries"
  to emphasize their significant contributions to CO2 emissions despite their smaller
  population shares. Use color to differentiate income groups. The chart should clearly
  show the disparity between population share and CO2 emissions, providing contextual
  annotations to guide viewers on these key insights, essential for understanding
  environmental impact and policy-making.
