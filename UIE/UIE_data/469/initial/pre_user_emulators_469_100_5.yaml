  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Waffle chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Waffle chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a waffle chart that visualizes the share of CO2 emissions from air travel
  and the share of world population. Use the categories "High income countries," "Upper-middle
  income countries," and "Lower-middle income countries" as labels. The chart should
  clearly show the percentage contributions of each category to both CO2 emissions
  and the world population, side by side, for easy comparison. Make sure it is easy
  to distinguish between the two datasets, perhaps using different colors for each
  dataset. This is for an environmental science project, so accuracy and clarity are
  crucial.
