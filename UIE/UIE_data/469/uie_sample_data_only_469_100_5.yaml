  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.

09_answers: '1. I do not have a preferred color scheme or specific colors, whatever
  looks clear and visually appealing is fine.

  2. I am not sure about specific labeling styles or font preferences, just make sure
  it''s easy to read.

  3. I think including a legend would be helpful to distinguish between the datasets.

  4. I prefer the data to be displayed with percentage values.

  5. I do not know.

  6. I am not sure about the grid size, but a 10x10 grid sounds good.'
