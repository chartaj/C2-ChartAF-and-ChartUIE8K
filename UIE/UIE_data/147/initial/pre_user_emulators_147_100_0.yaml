  Create a heatmap visualizing the number of unique languages spoken across different
  countries. Highlight countries with the highest linguistic diversity. Annotate key
  data points like Afghanistan, Albania, and Algeria, focusing on the different official
  and minority languages spoken. The heatmap should help in understanding the distribution
  and concentration of languages globally, serving both educational and analytical
  purposes in the field of literature and linguistics.
