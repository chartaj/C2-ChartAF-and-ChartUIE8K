  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme; you can choose what looks best.

  2. I do not know; any professional style or theme is fine.

  3. Labels would be good for annotating the outliers.

  4. I am not sure about specific axis labels or chart title.

  5. Yes, please include a legend for clarity.

  6. I do not have a specific preference; just ensure that the highlights for max
  and min trade volumes are easily noticeable.

  7. I do not know about the font type and size; a clear and legible font would be
  sufficient.

  8. I have no specific preference for gridlines or background elements, whichever
  enhances clarity is fine.'
