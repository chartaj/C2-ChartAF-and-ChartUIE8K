  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

09_answers: '1. I do not have a specific color preference.

  2. The title could be "Average Air and Process Temperatures by Product Type".

  3. The x-axis should be labeled "Product Type", and the y-axis should be labeled
  "Temperature (K)".

  4. I am not sure about the font style or size.

  5. Yes, please include data labels on the bars to show the exact values.

  6. I do not have any specific requirements for the background color or gridlines.

  7. I do not know about any additional annotations or notes.

  8. The order L, M, H would be fine.'
