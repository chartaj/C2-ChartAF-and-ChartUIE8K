  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a histogram visualizing the frequency distribution of 'label' in the dataset,
  which outlines heartbeat sounds for health analysis. Highlight the data points with
  missing 'sublabel' values to emphasize areas needing attention. Additionally, attach
  data-driven text annotations depicting the exact count of missing 'sublabel' values.
  This visualization aims to identify the prevalence of different 'label' categories
  and draw focus to incomplete data points for potential quality improvement. Utilize
  the dataset efficiently to ensure clarity and actionability for health data review
  purposes.
