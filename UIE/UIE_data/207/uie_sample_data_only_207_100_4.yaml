02_initial_prompt: Can you create a bar chart to visualize the Boston Housing dataset?
  Specifically, I'd like to see a comparison between the average Room count (RM),
  Lower status of the population (LSTAT), and Pupil-teacher ratio (PTRATIO) for different
  median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) categories. Please group MEDV into categories
  like low, medium, high, etc., and present the average values for each category.
  Use distinct colors for each category to differentiate them clearly. This will help
  in understanding how these variables relate to different housing price ranges. Thank
  you!

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
