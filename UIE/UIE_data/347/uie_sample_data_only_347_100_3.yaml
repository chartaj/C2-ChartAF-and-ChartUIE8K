  the provided video game sales dataset. Use the 'Global_Sales' column to color-code
  countries based on sales figures. Countries with higher sales should have a darker
  color. Represent sales data in North America, Europe, Japan, and Other regions specifically.
  Ensure labels are clear and a legend is included to explain the color gradient.
