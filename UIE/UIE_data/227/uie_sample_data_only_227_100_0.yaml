  Highlight the "age" column and add text annotations showing the values linked to
  the bars representing different age ranges. This will help emphasize specific age
  groups and draw attention to any notable patterns. Use different colors to highlight
  significant age ranges. The purpose is to understand the age demographic represented
  in the Trolley Dilemma dataset. Include context about expected years left to provide
  more depth. This visualization will aid in analyzing the ethical implications across
  different age groups.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
