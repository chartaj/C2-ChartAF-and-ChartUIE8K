2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a scatter plot to visualize the Carbon Dioxide Emission Rates using the provided
  environmental-science data. Plot 'Decimal_Date' on the x-axis and 'Average' on the
  y-axis. Annotate critical data points to highlight significant trends and ensure
  clarity. Additionally, vary marker sizes and colors to emphasize disparities and
  trends over the years. Add descriptive text annotations to clarify peaks and notable
  changes, using non-data-driven annotations for context. Highlight trends using different
  colors for comparative analysis of 'Average' versus 'Trend' values across time.
  Ensure the visualization focuses on key emissions data while offering context through
  annotations.
