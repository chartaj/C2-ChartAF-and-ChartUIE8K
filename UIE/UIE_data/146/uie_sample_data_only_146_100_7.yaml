02_initial_prompt: I need a histogram that shows the distribution of the winning margin
  across different constituencies from the Lok Sabha Election Results 2024 India dataset.
  Please use the 'Margin' column for the x-axis and the frequency of each margin range
  for the y-axis. The histogram should help visualize how close or overwhelming the
  victories were in different constituencies. Make sure to label the axes clearly
  and provide a title for the histogram. This will help in understanding the competitiveness
  of the election in various regions. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization
