2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a line chart to show the trend of total alcohol consumption per capita over
  the years for different entities. Include text annotations to highlight significant
  changes or points in the data. Additionally, use highlights to emphasize specific
  entities or years, making important data points stand out visually. The data provides
  insights into alcohol consumption patterns and can be used for health and policy
  analysis. Ensure the visualization clearly differentiates various entities and shows
  year-by-year changes. Annotations should guide viewers to notable trends and outliers
  in the dataset for better understanding.
