- Create a stacked bar chart to visualize the total weekly attendance at Queens' "Playground
  for All Children" for different sports. Highlight each day's attendance within a
  week and provide text annotations for the attendance values on Sundays and Thursdays
  to draw attention. This visualization will help analyze the popularity of sports
  and identify peak attendance days.
