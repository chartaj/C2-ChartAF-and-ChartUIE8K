  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart?

  2. How would you like the outliers to be annotated? (e.g., with specific text, symbols)

  3. Should the chart include a legend, and if so, what details should it cover?

  4. Do you want gridlines in the background to help interpret the data?

  5. What labels or titles would you like for the x-axis and y-axis?

  6. Is there a specific way you''d prefer the months to be displayed on the x-axis?
  (e.g., abbreviated, full names)

  7. How would you like the months with the most fires to be highlighted? (e.g., different
  color, bold labels)

  8. Do you need any additional information such as the total number of fires per
  state to be included in the chart?

  9. Is there a particular format you would like for the text annotations on the significant
  outliers?

  10. Would you like the chart to include a summary or descriptive statistics of the
