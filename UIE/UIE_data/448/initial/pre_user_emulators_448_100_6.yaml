- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n2. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Bar chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Bar chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

- 'Could you create a bar chart illustrating the food consumption across different
  countries? The columns to include are ''Red Meat,'' ''White Meat,'' ''Eggs,'' ''Milk,''
  ''Fish,'' ''Cereals,'' ''Starch,'' ''Nuts,'' and ''Fruits & Vegetables.'' I would
  like to compare these food items for three countries: Albania, Austria, and Belgium.
  Each group of bars should represent one country, with different colors for each
  food category. This will help in understanding the dietary patterns among these
  countries. Please use the data provided in the CSV file located at ../Extra_datas/data/448.csv.'
