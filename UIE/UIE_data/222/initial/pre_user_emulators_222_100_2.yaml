2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map visualizing the Top 100 Cities Weather Dataset. Use color
  gradients to represent temperature variations across different cities. Annotate
  the map with the city names and their respective temperatures, particularly highlighting
  cities with extreme temperatures (hottest and coldest). Additionally, include markers
  that show wind speed information. Ensure the map provides clear visual differentiation
  between countries. Include side text annotations specifying interesting findings,
  such as notable temperature differences between neighboring cities. This will help
  viewers quickly grasp diverse weather patterns worldwide.
