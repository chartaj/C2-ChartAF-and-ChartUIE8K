  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart from the concrete strength dataset to visualize the average compressive
  strength (csMPa) at different ages. Highlight the bars representing the ages 28
  and 270 days for emphasis. Add text annotations showing the exact csMPa values for
  these bars. This chart will help in understanding how concrete strength develops
  over time, important for urban planning and construction decisions. Make sure the
  x-axis represents the age in days and the y-axis represents the compressive strength
  in MPa. Provide a title that reflects the relevance to concrete strength and urban
  planning.
