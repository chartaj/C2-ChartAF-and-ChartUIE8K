  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a specific color scheme preference for the box plot?

  2. Would you like the age axis to be logarithmic or linear?

  3. Do you prefer any specific annotations for the significant data points (e.g.,
  symbols, texts)?

  4. How would you like the median values to be highlighted (e.g., different color,
  bold line, etc.)?

  5. Should the whiskers of the box plot represent all data points, percentiles, or
  adjustable parameters?

  6. Would you like to include gridlines for better readability?

  7. Do you prefer any specific labels or titles for the axes and the plot?

  8. Should outliers be marked in a specific way, or follow the standard box plot
  convention?

  9. Would you like any additional statistical information (e.g., mean, standard deviation)
  to be displayed on the plot?

  10. Is there a preferred style for the box and whisker elements (e.g., dashed lines,
