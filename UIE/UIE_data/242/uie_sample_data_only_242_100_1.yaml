02_initial_prompt: Create a grouped bar chart to visualize the gender wage gap percentages
  across different years for various countries. Use text annotations to highlight
  the highest and lowest gaps within each country. Also, use highlights to emphasize
  any significant changes over time. The chart will show how gender wage inequality
  fluctuates, providing insight into trends and patterns across different regions.
  This visualization aims to make it easier to compare gender wage disparities, helping
  in understanding economic inequality on a global scale. Use readable colors and
  ensure the chart is easy to understand at a glance.
