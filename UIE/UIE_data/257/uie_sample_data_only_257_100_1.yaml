  1. I do not have a specific color scheme in mind.

  2. I am not sure, maybe combined in one chart with color differentiation?

  3. Different markers would be good.

  4. I do not know, just make it clear and readable.

  5. I am not sure, perhaps by decade is a good idea.

  6. I have no specific preference, but make it clear and professional.

  7. Yes, summary statistics would be useful.

  8. I do not have specific preferences.
