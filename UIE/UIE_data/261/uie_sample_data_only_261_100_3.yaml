02_initial_prompt: Create a dot plot for "NASA Astronauts, 1959-Present" categorized
  by "Year" and "Group". Each dot should represent an astronaut, colored to indicate
  "Status" (Active, Retired, etc.). Size of the dot should reflect the number of "Space
  Flights". Plot "Birth Place" on the y-axis to see geographic distribution over time.
  Highlight "Space Walks" on a secondary scale. Ensure missing values are handled

  diversity, and experience over time.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
