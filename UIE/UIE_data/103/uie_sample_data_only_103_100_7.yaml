  of the total sale amounts, and the 'Quantity' column will illustrate the distribution
  of quantities sold. This will help in identifying trends and patterns in the sales

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
