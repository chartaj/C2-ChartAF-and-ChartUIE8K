  of blockchain jobs in India for 2022. The data includes company names, job titles,
  locations, whether easy apply options are available, and salary ranges. Highlight
  job density in different locations using intensity levels to show where blockchain
  job opportunities are concentrated. Include key identifying metrics such as number
  of job postings per location, unique companies, and salary ranges. Utilize color
  gradients to represent these variables effectively, ensuring the map is both informative
  and visually appealing. Also, ensure the labels are clear for easy interpretation.
