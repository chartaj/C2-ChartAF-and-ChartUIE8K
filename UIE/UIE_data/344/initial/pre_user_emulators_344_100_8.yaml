- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Column chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Column chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a column chart for "Blockchain Jobs India 2022" data from Glassdoor, found
  in the cryptocurrency-and-blockchain category. The chart should display job titles
  on the x-axis and salary ranges (using both the lower and upper limits) on the y-axis.
  The bars should show the variation in salaries with different colors for the lower
  and upper limits. Additionally, indicate job locations as labels on the bars and
  highlight easy-apply positions with a distinct marker or color. The data should
  include the companies and their respective job locations as well. This will give
  a comprehensive overview of blockchain job salaries in India for 2022.
