  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have any preference for the color scheme used for different
  years in the line chart?

  2. Should the lines representing different years have different styles (e.g., solid,
  dashed, dotted)?

  3. Would you like data points to be marked on the lines, and if so, what style of
  markers do you prefer?

  4. Is there a specific date format you prefer for the X-axis labels?

  5. Do you want grid lines on the chart for better readability, and if so, should
  they be shown for both axes or just one?

  6. How should the legend be positioned on the chart (e.g., top, bottom, left, right)?

  7. Do you need any annotations or specific labels to highlight key temperature points
  or trends?

  8. Are there any specific titles or labels you would like for the X-axis, Y-axis,
  or the chart itself?

  9. Would you prefer the chart to display month names on the X-axis, or would numerical
  representation suffice?

  10. Do you require any tooltips or hover text to display specific data values when
  the user hovers over a data point?'

09_answers: '1. I am not sure.

  2. I am not sure.

  3. I do not know.

  4. I prefer the date format to be in "MMM" (e.g., Jan, Feb).

  5. Yes, grid lines on the chart would be helpful for better readability, shown for
  both axes.

  6. I do not have a specific preference for the legend position.

  7. I do not know.

  8. The X-axis should be labeled "Date," the Y-axis should be labeled "Temperature,"
  and the chart title should be "Highest Monthly Temperatures Recorded in Amherst."

  9. Month names on the X-axis would be preferred.

  10. I do not need tooltips or hover text.'
