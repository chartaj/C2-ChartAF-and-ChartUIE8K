  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  It MUST be a chart that can be created using only data columns.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Bar chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Bar chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a bar chart to visualize the population of different cities. Use the
  'name' column for the x-axis to represent city names and the 'pop' column for the
  y-axis to represent the population numbers. This will help in comparing the population
  sizes of various cities. Ensure that the chart clearly labels both axes and includes
  a title for better understanding. This is important for urban planning and demographic
  analysis. Thank you!
