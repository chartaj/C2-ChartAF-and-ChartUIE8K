  4. Represent them within the same box chart.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, adding grid lines would help.

  8. I do not have a specific preference.

  9. Yes, a legend would be helpful.

  10. Include a title like "GPA Distribution Across Different Classes" and a subtitle
  like "Analysis by Gender and Race Demographics."'
