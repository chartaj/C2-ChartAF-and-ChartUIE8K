  by 'Critical Reading Mean,' 'Mathematics Mean,' and 'Writing Mean' for each school.
  Each bar group represents a school with different colored bars for each SAT category

  1. I do not have specific color preferences.

  2. The title could be "Comparison of Average SAT Scores by School".

  3. I am not sure about the font preferences.

  4. I do not know if the sample schools should be highlighted.

  5. Yes, a legend would be helpful. Position it at the bottom right.

  6. Display the schools in alphabetical order.

  7. Including data labels on top of each bar to show exact values would be great.
