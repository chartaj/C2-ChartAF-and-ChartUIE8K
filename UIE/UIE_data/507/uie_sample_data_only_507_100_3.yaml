  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a bubble chart illustrating the relationship between the ''Electorate'' size
  and the percentage of votes for ''CON'', ''LAB'', and ''LIB''. The x-axis should
  represent ''Electorate'', and the y-axis should show vote percentages for ''CON(%)'',
  ''LAB(%)'', and ''LIB(%)''. Each bubble should represent an electoral area with
  its size corresponding to the total number of votes in that area. Color code the
  bubbles based on the winning party (''Winner''). Include a legend for party color
  coding and a tooltip to display detailed info for each area on hover. This will
  help visualize voting patterns across different electorates.
