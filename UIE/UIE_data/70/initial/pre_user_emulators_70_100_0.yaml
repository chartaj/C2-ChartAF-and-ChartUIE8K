  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a box chart visualizing the Google (GOOG) stock prices data. Emphasize specific
  data points for the dates 2015-01-02, 2015-01-05, and 2015-01-06 using text annotations
  to highlight their Open, High, Low, and Close values. Use highlights to differentiate
  the highest and lowest prices within the dataset. The chart should effectively allow
  viewers to understand fluctuations in stock prices over time, highlighting significant
  deviations or trends to inform business decisions. Focus on making the visual informative
  and easy to interpret for quick insights into stock performance.
