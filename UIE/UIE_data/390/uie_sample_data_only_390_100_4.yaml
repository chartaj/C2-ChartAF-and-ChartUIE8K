02_initial_prompt: Create a bubble chart to visualize the company collaboration network.
  Each bubble should represent a node from the dataset, where the size of the bubble
  correlates with the 'weight'. Use different colors for the different 'groups' to
  easily distinguish between them. Display 'source' and 'target' connections using
  lines between the bubbles if available. Make sure to label the bubbles with 'name'
  for clear identification. Only show values with no missing data to maintain a clean
  and accurate representation. This will help understand the relationships and central
  figures within the network.

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a bubble chart to visualize the company collaboration network. Each bubble
  should represent a node from the dataset, where the size of the bubble correlates
  with the ''weight''. Use different colors for the different ''groups'' to easily
  distinguish between them. Display ''source'' and ''target'' connections using lines
  between the bubbles if available. Make sure to label the bubbles with ''name'' for
  clear identification. Only show values with no missing data to maintain a clean
  and accurate representation. This will help understand the relationships and central

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
