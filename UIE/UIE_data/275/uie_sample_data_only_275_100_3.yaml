  plastic waste globally over different years. Use "coastal-population-vs-mismanaged-plastic.csv"
  from environmental science data. Highlight countries based on the amount of mismanaged
  plastic waste in tonnes, with color gradients depicting various levels. Include
  year as a filter to see changes over time. The map should also show coastal population
  density as an overlay. Ensure missing data is appropriately handled. This is for

  policies.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
