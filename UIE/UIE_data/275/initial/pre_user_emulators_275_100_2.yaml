2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize a line chart showing the trend of Mismanaged Plastic Waste (tonnes) over
  the years. Highlight significant increases with annotations. Use different lines
  for various entities like countries. The chart should illustrate how coastal populations
  correlate with mismanaged plastic waste over time. This visualization will help
  understand environmental impacts and population effects on waste management. Include
  annotations on the chart to emphasize key data points, peaks, and trends. Show legends
  and axis labels for clarity. Ensure missing data values are acknowledged in the
  footnote or chart notes for transparency. Add a title related to environmental science
  impacts.
