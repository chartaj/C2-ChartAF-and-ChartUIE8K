  2. I am not sure about the bin size; you can determine it based on the data.

  3. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  4. Yes, labels for the x- and y-axes would be helpful. No specific labels in mind.

  5. I do not have any specific formatting preferences for the titles.

  6. I do not know about the aspect ratio or size; you can decide what works best.

  7. I am not sure about additional annotations or markers.
