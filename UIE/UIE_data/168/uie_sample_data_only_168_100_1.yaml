  2. I am not sure; I leave it up to your expertise to identify and highlight significant
  age group ranges.

  3. I do not have a specific preference for the font style or size for the text annotations.

  4. I am not sure about the line styles; please choose what you think would be most
  effective.

  5. I do not know; place the legend where it would be most clear and aesthetically
  pleasing.

  6. I do not know of any specific trends or anomalies; please use your judgment to
  highlight important ones.

  7. Yes, please label the x-axis as "Age" and the y-axis as "Cholesterol (mg/dL)".

  8. I do not have a preferred size or aspect ratio for the chart.
