  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have a specific color palette preference for different penguin
  species?

  2. How would you like the years to be displayed on the x-axis (e.g., every year,
  every other year)?

  3. Should the chart include data points for each year, or would you prefer a smoothed
  line without data points?

  4. Do you prefer to see both bill length and flipper length on the same chart, or
  would you like separate charts for each measurement?

  5. Would you like to include a legend to distinguish the different penguin species,
  or should the species be labeled directly on the line?

  6. Is there a particular font style or size you prefer for axis labels and titles?

  7. Should the y-axis have a fixed range for better comparison, or would you prefer
  it to adjust automatically based on the data?

  8. Would you like to display gridlines for better readability, and if so, how prominently
  should they be displayed?

  9. Do you want to highlight any specific trends or years in the chart with annotations
  or markers?

  10. Are there any additional elements you want to include, such as a title, subtitle,
