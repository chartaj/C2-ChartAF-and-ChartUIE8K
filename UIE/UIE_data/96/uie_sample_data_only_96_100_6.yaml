02_initial_prompt: Please create a grouped bar chart using the Palmer Penguins Dataset
  from environmental science. The chart should compare the mean body mass of different
  species of penguins across various islands. Make sure the x-axis represents different
  species and the bars within each species group represent different islands. Each
  bar's height should reflect the average body mass (in grams). Use different colors
  to distinguish between the islands. This will help visualize how body mass varies
  by species and island location. Thank you!

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.
