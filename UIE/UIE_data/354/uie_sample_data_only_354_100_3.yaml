07_questions: '1. Do you have a preference for the color scheme used to represent
  different ranges of trading volumes and price variations?

  2. How would you like the color gradients to be represented? For example, do you
  prefer darker colors for higher values or lighter colors?

  and lowest trading volumes or price ranges?
