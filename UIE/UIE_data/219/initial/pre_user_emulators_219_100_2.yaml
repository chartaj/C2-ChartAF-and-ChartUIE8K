2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a box chart visualizing the 'Final Score' for different states comparing
  their logistics quality. Use the annotations to highlight the states with the highest
  and lowest scores, as well as any outliers. The chart aims to show the distribution
  of scores across states, emphasizing variations in logistics quality. Additionally,
  include a summary area describing the key metrics such as Quality of Road Infrastructure,
  Quality of Rail Infrastructure, and Timeliness of Cargo Delivery, to provide context
  about factors influencing the scores. This will help in understanding state-level
  logistics efficiency.
