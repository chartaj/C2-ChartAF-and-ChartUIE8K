- Please create a pie chart depicting the market share of different browsers using
  the provided data. Highlight key browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Safari by changing
  their slice colors to make them stand out. Data annotations for percentage values
  should be included for these browsers to draw attention to their market share. The
  purpose of this chart is to visualize the dominance of specific browsers in the
  market and help identify trends in browser usage for computers and technology. Provide
  additional context or editorial comments where necessary. Ensure the pie chart is
  clear and easily understandable.
