02_initial_prompt: I have a dataset about browser market share, including different
  browsers, their versions, and corresponding data values. This data is under the
  category of computers and technology. I would like a stacked bar chart that visualizes
  the distribution of market share across the different versions of each browser.
  Each bar should represent a browser, with segments showing the versions and their
  respective data values stacked within that bar. This visualization should help to
  compare the browser versions and understand the overall market influence of each
  browser. Please make sure the chart is easy to read and interpret.
