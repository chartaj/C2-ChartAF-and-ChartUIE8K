07_questions: '1. Do you have any specific color schemes or palettes you prefer for
  the heatmap?

  2. Are there particular color scales (e.g., diverging, sequential) you want to use

  directly, or should there be specific highlights for strong positive or negative
  correlations?

  4. Do you have a preference for the range of values displayed for the correlation
  coefficients (e.g., -1 to 1)?

  5. Should the heatmap include exact numerical correlation values on the cells, or
  do you prefer to rely solely on color intensity?

  6. Do you want any specific annotations on the heatmap, such as star indicators
  for statistically significant correlations?

  7. Do you prefer hierarchical clustering or any specific arrangement for the variables
  in the heatmap to better illustrate their relationships?

  8. How would you like the labels to be formatted (e.g., font size, style)?

  9. Should the heatmap have a title or any supplementary text for explanatory purposes?
