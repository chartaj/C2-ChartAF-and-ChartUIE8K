  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

  2. Would you like the column chart to be grouped or stacked based on categories
  like ''Foot Traffic'', ''Consumer Demographics'', or ''Product Category''?

  3. Should the x-axis or y-axis have a specific title or label format?

  4. How would you like the text annotations to be formatted (e.g., font size, color,
  or placement)?

  5. Should the chart include a legend to differentiate between the categories?

  6. Do you have any preference for the range or scale of the y-axis (sales volume)?

  7. Would you like grid lines to be displayed on the chart for better readability?
  If so, should they be for both axes or just one?'
