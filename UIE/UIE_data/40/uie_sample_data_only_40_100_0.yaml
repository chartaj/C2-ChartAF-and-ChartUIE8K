  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Create a Treemap to visualize the "Hepatitis C Prediction Dataset" focusing on health
  categories. Each rectangle should represent a category (''Category''). Highlight
  and annotate critical health metrics like ''ALB'', ''ALT'', ''AST'', and ''BIL''.
  Emphasize data points that have missing values to identify gaps. Use distinct colors
  to differentiate between ''Category'' and ''Age''. This will help in quickly identifying
  the distribution and concentration of health parameters across different categories
