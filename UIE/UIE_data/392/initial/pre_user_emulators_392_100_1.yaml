2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a network graph to visualize energy flow from sources to sectors. Use nodes
  to represent each energy type (e.g., Coal, NaturalGas, Nuclear) and lines to show
  connections. Highlight key nodes and connections using different colors or sizes.
  Annotate specific nodes with data values for context. This chart aims to illustrate
  the relationships and dependencies between energy sources and their respective sectors,
  emphasizing critical elements for easier comprehension. Add non-data-driven annotations
  for additional insights. Ensure the chart is straightforward and informative, focusing
  on essential flow pathways and values where data is available.
