  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you have specific colors in mind for the different energy sources
  and sectors?

  2. Do you prefer a particular layout or orientation for the Sankey diagram (e.g.,
  left-to-right, top-to-bottom)?

  3. Are there any specific annotations or labels you want to include for key data
  points and flows?

  4. Are there any thresholds or values that should be highlighted with specific visual
  features (e.g., larger flows, different colors)?

  5. Do you have preferences for the font style and size for the labels and annotations?

  6. Should the diagram include a legend to explain the colors and symbols used?

  7. Do you have any specific preferences for the thickness or width of the flow lines?

  8. Are there any constraints on the size or dimensions of the final diagram?

  9. Should the flows be proportional to the value they represent, or do you have
  another preference?

  10. Would you like the nodes (energy sources and sectors) to have specific shapes
  or designs?'
