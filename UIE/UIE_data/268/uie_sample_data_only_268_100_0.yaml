02_initial_prompt: Please create a column chart showcasing the population growth of
  various districts in Bangladesh across different years (1991, 2001, 2011, 2022).
  Highlight the districts with the highest population growth. Add text annotations
  to the columns representing the population in 2022 for easier readability. The chart
  should help visualize population trends and identify areas of significant growth,
  aiding in social science research on demographic changes in Bangladesh. Ensure the
