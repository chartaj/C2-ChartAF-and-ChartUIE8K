  technologies were first and last seen across various website domains. Use the "First
  Seen At" and "Last Seen At" dates on the x-axis, and "Website Domain" categories

  "First Seen At" and "Last Seen At" with different colors or markers. Additionally,
  include a legend that shows the different technology names for better clarity. This

09_answers: '1. I do not have any specific preference for the colors or markers.

  2. I am not sure about a specific style or design for the legend.

  3. Yes, the chart should have a titled header. It can be "Technology Adoption Timeline
  Across Website Domains".

  4. Including gridlines would be good for better readability.

  5. I do not know, any logical order will work.

  6. I am not sure about highlighting specific technologies or domain categories.

  7. I do not know, you can include trend lines or annotations if necessary.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the date formats on the x-axis labels.'
