  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\

  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a bar chart visualizing the number of unique "Technology Name" entries per
  "Website Domain". Highlight domains with the highest technology count. Annotate
  specific data points to reflect the first and last seen dates for a few highlighted
  technologies. The chart aims to show technological adoption trends across different
  business websites, emphasizing those with the broadest range of technology use.
  This visualization helps stakeholders understand which sites are leaders in technology
  application and monitor their technological landscape over time. The practicality
  of this chart lies in its ability to identify and showcase domain leaders in technology
  usage.
