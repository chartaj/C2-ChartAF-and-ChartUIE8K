2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a column chart visualizing the provided words. The chart should highlight
  key terms and show how each word stands out. Use text annotations to add context
  and enhance understanding. Make sure the chart focuses on distinguishing certain
  words by modifying their appearance, such as changing size or color. The purpose
  of this visualization is to emphasize important words in literature and linguistics,
  drawing attention to them effectively. Include a title for the chart and clear labels
  for the columns to ensure readability and engagement. Thank you!
