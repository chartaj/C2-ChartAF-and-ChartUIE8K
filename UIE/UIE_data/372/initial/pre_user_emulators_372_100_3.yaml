  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Word cloud that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Word cloud that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a word cloud visualization using the data provided in the "words" column
  from the JSON file. The Word World theme is literature-and-linguistics, so the word
  cloud may contrast literary genres and linguistic terms. Ensure to showcase the
  most frequent words prominently while considering the uniqueness and variety of
  terms. Use appropriate sizes, fonts, and colors to improve readability and visual
  appeal, reflecting the essence of "Football," "Basketball," and "Baseball" in the
  linguistic context. Make sure no data point goes unnoticed by adjusting the word
  sizes based on their frequency, and provide a legend if necessary. Thanks!
