2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- I need a line chart visualizing the relationship between 'Age' and 'Duration' of
  VR usage, with 'Gender' differentiated by line color or style. Use text annotations
  to highlight the peak and lowest 'Duration' values and points where 'MotionSickness'
  is 8. Emphasize differences in 'ImmersionLevel' using varied line thickness for
  distinct insight. Ensure the visual draws clear attention to age-related trends
  in VR experience duration, offering insights into demographic usage patterns and
  user well-being. This chart should reflect the detailed context of virtual reality
  experiences effectively. Thank you!
