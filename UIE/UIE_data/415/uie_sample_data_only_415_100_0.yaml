  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

09_answers: '1. The title could be "Spotify Subscribers and Non-Subscribers Growth
  (2015-2020)".

  2. I am not sure about the specific colors; maybe one bright color for subscribers
  and a contrasting color for non-subscribers?

  3. I do not know.

  4. No specific milestones or events come to mind apart from the highest and lowest
  points.

  5. I am not sure, maybe just something easily readable.

  6. Absolute numbers would be great.

  7. The legend could be placed at the top.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for font style or size.

  9. Yes, gridlines would be helpful. Any standard style is fine.'
