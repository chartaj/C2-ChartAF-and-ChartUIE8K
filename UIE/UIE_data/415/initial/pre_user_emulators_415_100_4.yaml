- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

  Given a data format, imagine a chart that visualizes this data as the final output
  you want from the service provider.

  You need to imagine a chart with * Area chart that utilizes the data format.

  If there are multiple given data formats, imagine a chart with * Area chart that
  utilizes all the data formats.

  Since you are an amateur user, your instruction will be partially SUBJECTIVE and
  NOT DETAILED.

  Also, refer to the data details to create as practical and realistic instructions
  as possible.

  Instructions must reflect the context of the data.

  To emulate a real-world user your instruction should be 100 in size (word count).

  Your response should ONLY contain the user emulated instruction.

  Do not include anything else.'

- 'Please create an area chart to visualize the data on Spotify users and subscriber
  growth over the period from 2015 to 2020, divided by quartals. The chart should
  have the x-axis representing quartals, labeled as ''2015-Q1'', ''2015-Q2'', etc.,
  and the y-axis representing the number of users in millions. The chart should have
  three areas: one for subscribers, one for non-subscribers, and one for the total
  number of users. Differentiate the areas with distinct colors and include a legend.
  This way, we can easily see the trends and compare subscribers versus non-subscribers.'
