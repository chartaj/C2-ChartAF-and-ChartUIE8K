07_questions: '1. Do you have a preferred color scheme for the chart, especially for
  ''subscribers'' and ''non_subscribers''?

  2. What is the preferred font style and size for the axis labels, title, and legend?

  3. Are there any specific axis ranges or scales you want to enforce for the x-axis
  (years) and y-axis (user counts)?

  4. Do you want gridlines to be displayed on the chart for better readability? If
  so, should they be major, minor, or both?

  5. Is there a specific format in which you want the legend to be displayed (e.g.,
  vertical, horizontal)?

  6. Do you have a specific requirement for the title''s position (e.g., centered,
  left-aligned)?

  7. Is there any specific padding or margin you want to apply around the chart for
  better aesthetics?

  8. Should the data points for each quarter (e.g., ''2015-Q1'', ''2015-Q2'') be presented
  as labels on the x-axis, or just annotated within the chart?

  9. Are there any additional annotations or markers you would like to include in
  the chart to highlight key events or trends?

  10. Would you like any hover or tooltip information to appear when hovering over
  specific parts of the chart?'
