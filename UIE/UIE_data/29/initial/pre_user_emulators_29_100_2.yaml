2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize the traffic prediction dataset using a heatmap. The x-axis should represent
  different DateTime values, and the y-axis should represent the Junction numbers.
  The intensity of the heatmap cells should reflect the number of Vehicles. Use text
  annotations to highlight specific DateTime and Junction combinations with unusually
  high or low vehicle counts. Modify the color scale to emphasize peak traffic times
  for better visual contrast. The objective is to allow quick identification of traffic
  patterns and anomalies across various junctions in the dataset. This will be useful
  for understanding and managing traffic flow effectively.
