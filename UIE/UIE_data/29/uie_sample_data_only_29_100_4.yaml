02_initial_prompt: I'd like to visualize the Traffic Prediction Dataset you have.
  Please create a bar chart. The x-axis should represent different 'Junctions' while
  the y-axis should show the 'Vehicles'. The chart should indicate the total number
  of vehicles for each junction and should highlight distinct colors for each junction.
  Make sure to include labels for the axes and a title for the chart, something like
  "Number of Vehicles Per Junction". I need this visualization to understand the traffic
  flow at different junctions over time. Thank you!
03_asking_chartagent_to_find_data_attribute_task_visualization: 'You are a data visualization

  Given the data and user request, your task is to analyze the user request to figure
  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data
  visualization) from the initial instruction (user request) of the user, you have
  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
  the file format of the chart.

07_questions: '1. Do you prefer specific colors for each junction, or should they
  be randomly assigned?

  2. Would you like to see data labels displaying the exact counts of vehicles on
