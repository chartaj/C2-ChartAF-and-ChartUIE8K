  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.

  Given data, data attribute, tasks, prospective audience, purposes of the chart(data

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

09_answers: '1. I do not know.

  2. I am not sure, but maybe indicate the time and vehicle count for high traffic
  points.

  3. I do not have a specific preference.

  4. Yes, a legend to distinguish different junctions would be helpful.

  5. I do not know, maybe hourly for more detail.

  6. Yes, gridlines would be good for better readability.

  7. Title: "Vehicle Counts Over Time for Each Junction", x-axis: "Time", y-axis:
  "Vehicle Count".

  8. I am not sure.

  9. I do not know.

  10. I am not sure, but if it helps with clarity, then yes.'
