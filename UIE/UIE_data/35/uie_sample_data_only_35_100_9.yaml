02_initial_prompt: Please create a column chart that shows the average credit limit
  and the total transaction amount by customer age group for our credit card customers.
  Use the sample data provided. The X-axis should represent customer age groups (e.g.,
  40-45, 46-50, 51-55), and the Y-axis should show the average credit limit on one
  column and the total transaction amount on another. Separate the columns by age
  group and color them differently for clarity. This will help us visualize the spending
