02_initial_prompt: Please create a heatmap to visualize the distribution of job titles
  against company locations for data science job salaries. Specifically, I'd like
  to see which job titles are most common in various company locations; this will
  help us understand regional demand for specific roles. The data should show job
  titles on one axis and company locations on the other. Make sure to highlight regions
  with higher concentrations of specific job titles. Use color intensity to represent
  the number of occurrences for each combination of job title and company location.
