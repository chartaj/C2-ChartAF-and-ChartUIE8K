09_answers: '1. I am not sure about the color scheme, but something that clearly differentiates
  the highest and lowest values would be great.

  2. Yes, I would like to use arrows to highlight the highest and lowest values.

  3. Yes, please include a legend to explain the highlights and shapes used.

  4. I do not have a specific preference for the type of chart.

  5. Yes, including labels on the axis to clearly identify the time and signal values
  would be helpful.

  6. I do not know about specific font styles or sizes; anything that is clear and
  readable is fine.

  7. I am not sure if gridlines are necessary, but if they help make the data points
  easier to read, then yes.'
