02_initial_prompt: Please create a histogram using the Forbes Richest People dataset.
  I want the x-axis to represent the Age of the individuals, divided into appropriate
  age intervals, and the y-axis to show the count of individuals in each age group.
  The chart should help visualize the distribution of ages among the world's richest
  people. Make sure to highlight any missing values in the age data and how they are
  handled in the visualization. Additionally, a secondary observation of interest
  would be to see any significant outliers or trends in the age distribution.

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)

09_answers: '1. I am not sure. Please suggest based on standard practice.

  2. I do not know. Any color that represents the data clearly is fine.

  3. Please highlight missing values with a distinct color or annotation, I am not
  sure which one would be best.

  4. I do not have any specific preference for colors or markers for outliers.

  5. Yes, please include gridlines for better readability.

  6. For the x-axis: "Age of Individuals", and for the y-axis: "Count of Individuals".
  The title can be "Age Distribution of Forbes Richest People".

  7. I am not sure about the font style or size, whatever is standard should work.

  8. Yes, displaying the mean age and median age on the chart would be helpful.'
