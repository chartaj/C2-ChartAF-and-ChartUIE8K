  1. I do not know.

  2. Yes, the chart should include a legend explaining the bubble sizes and what they
  represent.

  3. I am not sure.

  4. The axes should be automatically scaled based on the data.

  5. I am not sure.

  6. I do not know.

  7. Yes, the chart should include grid lines for better readability.

  8. Yes, the chart should have a title and axis labels. The title could be "CO2 Emissions
  vs. Forest Area by Country". The axis labels could be "Forest Area (sq km)" for
  the x-axis and "CO2 Emissions (metric tons)" for the y-axis.

  9. I have no specific preference.
