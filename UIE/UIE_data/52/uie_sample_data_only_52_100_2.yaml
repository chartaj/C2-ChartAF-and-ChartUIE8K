  by their screen sizes. Use text annotations to display exact average prices on each
  bar for clarity. Highlight bars where the screen size is 15 inches or more to emphasize
  larger screen sizes. This would help in understanding the price variation among
  different screen sizes and could guide users looking to balance cost with display
  size for computer purchases. Utilize the "Basic Computer Data" context for this

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
