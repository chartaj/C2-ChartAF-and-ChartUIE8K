02_initial_prompt: Please create a bar chart to visualize the "Access to electricity
  (% of population)" over the years for Afghanistan using the provided dataset. This
  chart should show how electricity access has evolved from 2000 to 2002. Make sure
  to label the x-axis with years and the y-axis with the percentage of the population
  that has access to electricity. Additionally, color the bars to differentiate each

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.

  Do NOT include any questions related to (1) interactivity of the chart, and (2)
