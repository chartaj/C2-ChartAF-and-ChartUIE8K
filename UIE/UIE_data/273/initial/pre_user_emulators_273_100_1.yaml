  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a choropleth map displaying global access to electricity (% of population)
  by country. Highlight specific countries with notable trends and provide text annotations
  for countries with significant improvements or declines from 2000 to 2002. Ensure
  the map utilizes the unique values and highlights the disparities in electricity
  access. Include visual distinctions for regions with varied access levels and provide
  contextual text annotations to draw attention to key insights. This visual will
  help understand global progress and regional disparities in electricity access,
  essential for energy policy and developmental goals.
