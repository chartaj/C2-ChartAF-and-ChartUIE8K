2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a pie chart to visualize the distribution of unique slogans among different
  companies. Highlight each segment to emphasize its proportion. Additionally, use
  text annotations to display example slogans for the major segments. The purpose
  is to understand the variety and uniqueness of company slogans in marketing. Make
  sure the chart provides a clear breakdown and focuses on the unique values each
  company brings with its slogan. Include annotations to guide the viewer's attention
  to specific data points, enhancing context and insight derived from the visualization.
