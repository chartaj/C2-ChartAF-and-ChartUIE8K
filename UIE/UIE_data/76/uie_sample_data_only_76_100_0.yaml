  Use text annotations to highlight specific data points, such as the most common
  and least common quality scores. Highlight these scores and outliers in different
  colors to draw attention. This visualization will help understand the overall quality
  spread of the wines. Make sure to focus on the key elements that stand out in the

  a 2-step task to do.


  (1) First, your task is to figure out the essential chart attribute requirements
  that the chart must have in order to satisfy such tasks and purposes

  (2) Then, create a list of questions to the user if the user have specific chart
  attribute preference for effective data visualization.


  Do NOT include anything else in your response other than the list of questions.
  Your questions should be primarily focused on retrieving the user''s preferences.
