  need them to be overly detailed.

  3. I would like to see the quality distribution across different levels of alcohol
  and sulfur content through distinct color coding or labels.

  4. I do not have a specific order for displaying the chemical properties.

  5. I have no specific preference for the style or font for the text annotations.
