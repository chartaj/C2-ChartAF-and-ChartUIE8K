09_answers: '1. I prefer colors that distinctly differentiate between fibrotic (maybe
  red) and normal (maybe blue) conditions.

  2. "SMOC2 Raw Counts across Fibrotic and Normal Samples"

  3. I am not sure about specific font styles or sizes.

  4. Yes, I would like a legend included. I do not have a specific preference for
  its placement.

  5. The axes should be labeled "Samples" for the x-axis and "SMOC2 Raw Counts" for
  the y-axis.

  6. Yes, I would like gridlines. Major gridlines should be fine.

  7. I am not sure about specific markers, but it should be clear which points are
  the highest and lowest.

  8. I do not have a specific preference for the background color, default white is
  fine.

  9. No, there are no additional specific data points or ranges I want highlighted
  beyond the highest and lowest values.

  10. I do not have specific preferences for line styles; solid lines for both would
  be okay.'
