2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create an area chart using the 'time' column for the x-axis and 'signal' column
  for the y-axis. Highlight specific data points with text annotations to draw attention
  to significant peaks in the signal. Use color variations to emphasize changes in
  signal strength over time. This will help in easily identifying trends and anomalies
  within the dataset.
