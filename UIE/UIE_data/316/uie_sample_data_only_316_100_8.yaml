02_initial_prompt: Please create a histogram showing the distribution of bumblebee
  specimen collection years from the Southeast Asian Bumblebee Specimen Dataset. This
  will help visualize the number of specimens collected in different years. Ensure
  that the x-axis represents the years and the y-axis represents the frequency of
  collections. Use the 'Year' column to create this histogram. Exclude any missing
  values. Since the dataset spans different periods, it will be interesting to observe
  which years had the highest collection rates and any possible trends or gaps in
  data collection.

  out the (1) data attributes needed for data visualization, (2) select the most suitable
  task that the user is expecting from the list of various tasks in data visualization,
  (3) specifically figure out the purpose of the user''s request in data visualization,
  and (4) prospective audience of the data visualization.
