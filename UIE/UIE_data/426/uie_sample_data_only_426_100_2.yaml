  2. I do not have a specific preference for the font style.


  3. Yes, include notes about famous assassinations or natural causes, such as the
  assassination of Julius Caesar (although he''s not part of the Julio-Claudian dynasty,
  similar significant details should be highlighted for relevant emperors).

  and Causes of Death of Julio-Claudian Emperors".


  5. I do not know.


  6. The text annotations for the reign start and end dates should be reasonably detailed,
  including the month and year.


  7. I do not have a specific preference for the size or style of the marker.


  8. List the emperors in chronological order.


  9. Yes, the chart should have a legend explaining the colors used for different
  causes of death.
