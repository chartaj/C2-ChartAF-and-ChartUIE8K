  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Visualize the semiconductor industry trends from 1985 using a Bubble chart. Plot
  "DATE" on the x-axis and "Producer Price Index(By Industry in $)" on the y-axis.
  Use bubble size to represent "No. of employed peoples in semiconductor industry".
  Highlight significant data shifts such as peaks or valleys in the trends. Add annotations
  to explain unusual data points, like missing values in the "Export Price Index(End
  Use of semiconductors)" or "Import Price Index(in $ End Use of semiconductors)".
  This will help emphasize changes in employment and price indices over time amidst
  semiconductor shortages.
