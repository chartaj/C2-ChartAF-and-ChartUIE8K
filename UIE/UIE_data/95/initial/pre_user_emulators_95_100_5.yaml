- "<start of the annotation list> \n1. Text Annotations:\nDescription: Data-driven\
  \ text annotations display values linked to chart elements, such as data points\
  \ in a scatterplot. They draw attention to specific elements by highlighting their\
  \ values.\nPurpose: When only some elements are annotated, the intent is to focus\
  \ the viewer\u2019s attention on those before examining others.\nOther Uses: Non-data-driven\
  \ annotations can provide context, orientation, or editorial comments.\n  \n3. Highlights:\n\
  Description: Highlights modify the appearance of chart elements (e.g., size, color)\
  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Please create a bar chart using data from "../Extra_datas/data/95.csv," showing
  the "Forest Area as a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020" for each country. The
  chart should compare "Forest Area as a Proportion of Total Land Area, 2020" values
  across different countries. Specifically, I want to see how much of each country's
  land is covered by forests in 2020. Ensure the countries are listed along the x-axis,
  and the proportion of forest area is displayed on the y-axis. Use distinct colors
  for each country to enhance readability. Thank you.
