  \ to emphasize or reduce their importance.\nPurpose: Used to distinguish certain\
  \ elements from others, making them stand out visually\n<end of the annotation list>"

2. initial_prompt: !!python/tuple
- Create a histogram showing the distribution of budgets for the top 1000 highest-grossing
  movies. Clearly highlight and annotate the movies with the highest and lowest budgets
  to draw attention to these outliers. The chart should help in understanding how
  budget allocations vary among these top-performing films. This visualization can
  provide insights into the relationship between budget and movie success, aiding
  in financial planning and resource allocation for future film projects.
