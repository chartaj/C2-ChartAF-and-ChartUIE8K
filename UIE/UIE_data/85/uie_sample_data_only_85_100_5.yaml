02_initial_prompt: Please create a line chart visualizing the trend of Beats Per Minute,
  Energy, Danceability, Loudness, and Valence over the top 50 Spotify songs in 2019.
  Use the data from the CSV file located at '../Extra_datas/data/85.csv'. The x-axis
  should represent the track names, and the y-axis should measure the respective values
  for each parameter. This chart will help analyze the patterns and trends in musical
  features across popular songs. Make sure to distinguish each line with different
  colors and include a legend for clarity.
